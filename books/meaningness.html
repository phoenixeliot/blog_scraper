<p class="intro_para">Let’s start this book in the middle.  The <a href="#chap20">main course</a> is a ways off, and I want to give you a taste now.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about <em>purpose</em>.  (Purpose is one of the
<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss0')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> of meaningness discussed in this book.)</p>
<p>Especially at turning points in life, people ask questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any purpose at all in living?  Or is everything
  completely pointless?</li>
<li>What am I supposed to do?</li>
<li>How can I choose among the many ways I could spend the rest of
  my life?</li>
<li>Does everyone’s life have the  same purpose, or does everyone
  have their own?</li>
<li>Where does purpose come from?  Does it have some ultimate
  source, or is it just a personal invention?</li>
</ul>
<p>Various religions, philosophies, and systems claim to have answers.
Some are complicated, and they all seem quite different.  When you
strip away the details, though, there are only a half dozen fundamental
answers.  Each is appealing in its own way, but also problematic.
Understanding clearly what is right and wrong about each approach can
resolve the underlying problem.</p>
<p>Let’s go through these alternatives briefly.  I will explain each one in
detail in <a href="#chap20">the middle part</a> of the book.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2>Five confused attitudes to purpose</h2>
<blockquote><p>Everything has a fixed purpose, given by some sort of
fundamental ordering principle of the universe.  (This might be God,
or Fate, or the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss1')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>, or something.)  Humans too
have a specific role to play in the proper order of the universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss2')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a> of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss3')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>.  It may be 
comfortable.  If you just follow the eternal law, everything will
come out right.  Unfortunately, it often seems that much of life has no purpose.
At any rate, you cannot figure out what it
is supposed to be.  Priests or other authority figures claim
to know what the cosmic purposes are, but their advice often seems
wrong for particular situations.</p>
<p>For these reasons, even people who are explicitly committed to
eternalism generally fall into other stances at times.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing has any purpose.  Life is meaningless.  Any purposes
you imagine you have are illusions, errors, or lies.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss4')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.  It appears quite logical.  It
might seem to follow naturally from some scientific facts: everything is made of
subatomic particles; they certainly don’t have
purposes; and you can’t get purpose by glomming together a bunch of
purposeless bits.</p>
<p>It is easy to fall into nihilism in moments of despair; but,
fortunately, it is difficult to maintain, and hardly anyone holds it
for long.  Nevertheless, the seemingly compelling logic of nihilism
needs an answer.  It turns out that it is quite wrong, as a matter
again of science and logic.  But because that is not obvious, three other
stances try (and fail) to find a middle way between eternalism
and nihilism.</p>
<blockquote id="extra29_materialism"><p>The supposed cosmic purposes are doubtful at best, but
obviously, people do have goals.  There are human purposes no one can
seriously doubt: survival, health, sex, romance, fame, power,
enjoyable experiences, children, beautiful things.  Realistically,
those are what everyone pursues anyway.  You might as well drop the
hypocritical pretense of “higher” purposes and go for what you really
want.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss5')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>.  Realistically, most
people adopt this stance much of the time.  However, at times everyone
<i>does</i> recognize the value of altruistic and creative purposes,
which this stance rejects.  Moreover, most recognize that materialism
is an endless treadmill: the enjoyment of new goodies wears off
quickly, and then you are left craving the next, better thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can’t take it with you.  After you are dead, it is
meaningless how many toys you had.  What matters is how you live your
life: whether you create something of beauty or value for others.
You have unique capabilities to improve the world, and it’s your
responsibility to find and act on your personal gift.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss6')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a>.  The problem is that no one
actually has a “unique personal gift.”  God does not have plans for
us.  People waste a lot of time and effort trying to find “their
purpose in life,” and are miserable when they fail.  Besides that,
rejecting material purposes causes you to overlook genuine
opportunities for enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the universe (or God) does not supply us with purposes,
they are human creations.  Mostly people mindlessly adopt purposes that
are handed to them by society.  You need to throw those off, and choose
your own purposes, as an act of creative will.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the stance of <em>existentialism</em>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_3oc5ioi" id="extra29_footnoteref1_3oc5ioi" title="Actually, it is more-or-less what existentialists called “authenticity.”  Using that term would be confusing, because existentialist “authenticity” hasn’t got all that much to do with the everyday sense of the word.">1</a>
It is based on the
assumption that if purposes are not objective, or externally given,
they must be subjective, or internally created.  Existentialism holds out hope for
freedom.  But it is not actually possible to create your own purposes.
Choosing at random would be pointless, and impossible; and what <i>purely</i> personal
basis could you have for choosing one purpose over another?</p>
<h2>Resolving confusion</h2>
<p>Each of these confused stances treats meaning as fixed by an
external force, or denies meaning or some aspect of it.</p>
<p>The central message of this book is that meaning is real
(and cannot be denied), but is fluid (so it cannot be fixed).  It is
neither objective (given by God) nor subjective (chosen by individuals).</p>
<p>The book offers resolutions to problems of meaning that avoid
denial, fixation, and the impossibility of total
self-determination.  These resolutions are non-obvious, and sometimes
unattractive; but they are workable in ways the alternatives are not.</p>

<p>Both these stances are wrong, factually.  They are also unworkable, in their implications for living.</p>

<p>Eternalism and nihilism are both responses to the ambiguity of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss3')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a>.  In personal experience, meanings seem to resist focus, shift, and come and go.  Moreover, people disagree about what things mean.  Perhaps meanings are just a matter of opinion?  Meaning is important enough that this uncertainty is emotionally unacceptable.</p>
<p>The strategy of eternalism is to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'deny', 'gloss4')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense. [Click for details.]">deny</a> the ambiguity.  Despite appearances, it says, everything does have a clear and definite meaning, which is not merely subjective.  We might not perceive it, or we might mistake it, but it exists.</p>
<p>If meanings are objective, not human creations, it may seem they must come from some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss5')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimate</a>, transcendent source.  In many <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systems', 'gloss6')" title="“Systems,” in this book, are conceptual, methodological, and institutional structures that make claims about meaningness.  These include, for instance, religions, philosophies, political ideologies, and psychological frameworks. A system includes a structure of justification, which explains why you should believe its claims, and typically grounds in an eternal ordering principle. I contrast systems with stances, which are much simpler attitudes toward meaningness. [Click for details.]">systems</a>, that is a God.  In others, it is an abstraction, like Fate or Reason or the Absolute.  These are supposed to provide the sole source of meaning, purpose, value, and ethics.  I refer to any such source as an <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss7')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a> or <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss8')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is no eternal ordering principle, so eternalism is false as a fact-claim.  Arguments about that never seem to persuade anyone, however.  So I take this hyper-atheism for granted, and instead ask: what are our options if eternalism is wrong?</p>
<p>Here it is helpful to understand what works, and doesn’t work, about eternalism (and the other <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss2')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stances</a>) <em>emotionally</em>, rather than in terms of truth.</p>
<p>The appeal of eternalism is that questions of life-purpose and ethics have clear, simple answers.  If you act in accordance with this Cosmic Plan, you are guaranteed a good outcome.  You can be assured that seeming chaos and senseless misery are all orderly parts of the will of an all-good principle.</p>
<p>Even if it were factually true, eternalism could not deliver on this sales pitch.  The compelling emotional logic breaks down in some contexts.  In those situations, adopting the eternalist stance makes you think and act in ways that lead to big trouble.</p>
<p>It is difficult to see how the suffering caused by earthquakes could be willed by a benevolent God, or meaningful, or anything other than disasters that <em>just happened</em>.  The difficulty of maintaining willful blindness to meaninglessness is an obstacle to eternalism.  It is hard not to fall into the confused stance that <em>most</em> things are God’s will, but not the bad bits.  Once you admit that <em>some</em> things are meaningless, the logic of eternalism starts to fall apart.</p>
<p>To defend against that, you have to hallucinate a pastel-colored Disneyfied world in which everything works out for the best in the end, there is a silver lining in every cloud, everyone is beautiful inside, and all the world needs is love.</p>
<p>Threats to this vision must be destroyed.  Eternalist kitsch rapidly switches to self-righteous vengeance when contradicted.</p>
<p>Eternalism also requires you to submit to the Cosmic Plan, to do as it demands, rather than pursuing your own goals.  It is often unclear what God wants you to do, and sometimes what he wants is insane and harmful.  Then you either do the apparently right thing, which erodes your commitment to his ethical code, or you follow the prescription.  If that has the expected bad result, you must blind yourself to that, and harden yourself against the temptation to weaken the code to fit reality.</p>
<p>Much good is left undone because eternalism did not recommend it, and much harm is done in its name.  We also lose the freedom of courage: the freedom to risk, to take actions whose results we cannot predict.  Armored eternalism condemns such creativity.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_nihilism">Nihilism and its discontents</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Nihilism comes out red and black: rage and depression" height="398" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/nihilism.svg" title="Nihilism comes out red and black: rage and depression" width="560"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">Official nihilist flag</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nihilism starts from the intelligent recognition that eternalism is false and unworkable.  Most events are meaningless; meaning is not objective; there is no Cosmic Plan.</p>
<p>Nihilism then simply inverts the core claim of eternalism: it says everything is really meaningless.  Seeming meanings are illusory or arbitrary or subjective, and therefore unreal or unimportant.</p>
<p>This stance is unworkable.  Meaning is obvious everywhere, and it takes elaborate intellectualization to explain it away.  Attempting to live without significance, purpose, or value leads to rage, anguish, alienation, depression, and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Kitsch is worthy of contempt, but—through fear of being duped again—we extend contempt beyond kitsch to anything that affirms meaning.  This makes defiant nihilism actively hostile to more-or-less everything, but particularly beauty, virtue, kindness, and whatever else makes life worth living.</p>
<p>Eternalism blinds us by a simple effort of will, or faith.  Such simple stupidity is insufficient for nihilism: it is not possible to use mere force to fool ourselves that there is no meaning in the world.  Instead, nihilism uses intelligence against itself to produce stupidity.  Somehow meaning must be explained away by intellectual sleight-of-hand.  A theory is needed that can distract us from the obvious.  This theory has to get complicated quickly in order to be sufficiently confusing, or so brilliantly insightful as to dazzle us into submission.  This intellectual stupidity masquerades as intelligence.</p>
<p>Denying meaning blinds one to beauty, making all reality dull gray.  Denying purpose produces paralysis, with no possibility of choice and so no action.  Denying significance suggests that there is no urgency to do anything about it.</p>
<p>In depression, you recoil from the overwhelming vastness and complexity of reality.  You feel lost in space.  You put yourself in a box to create comforting limits.  Nihilism shuts down emotions to deny passion.</p>
<h2>A false dichotomy, and failing compromises</h2>
<p>When in the eternalist stance, it may seem that the only alternative is nihilism, and vice versa.  Because each has obvious dire faults, we adopt whichever seems less bad in a particular situation.  Because one looks worse, we try to stabilize ourselves in the other, declaring allegiance to it and viewing the opposite as the enemy.  But this is impossible.  Instead, we often squirm back and forth between the two in a sneaky, panicked way.  It’s common for people to switch between eternalism and nihilism repeatedly in the space of a few minutes.  Once you start to see this pattern, and catch yourself doing it, it becomes funny.</p>
<p>An alternate strategy is to try to find a compromise.  Without thinking about it carefully, we suppose that the world is somewhat governed by an eternal organizing principle (even if we are staunch atheists), and that the world is also somewhat horribly meaningless (even if we are committed eternalists).  Some things, we suppose, have definite meaning, and others are definitely meaningless.</p>
<p>The various “confused stances” discussed later in this book arise in this way.  Each is a bargain in which we reluctantly acknowledge meaninglessness in some parts of life, deny it in others, and try to get the world to accept that.  But it doesn’t; so every compromise causes new trouble, and fails.</p>
<p>The wrong idea underlying all confused stances is that things must be either definitely meaningful or else effectively meaningless.  Or, if meaning is not objective, it must be subjective.  But these are not the only possibilities.</p>
<h2>Completion: meaningness</h2>
<div class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="The complete stance of meaningness resolves the problems of eternalism and nihilism" height="333" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/tern_557998_500x333.jpg" width="500"/>
</div>
<p>I have coined the word “meaningness” to express the ambiguous quality of meaningfulness and meaninglessness that we encounter in practice.  According to the stance that recognizes meaningness, meaning is real but not definite.  It is neither objective nor subjective.  It is neither given by an external force nor a human invention.</p>
<p>I call this a “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss10')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a>” because it acknowledges two qualities: <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss11')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> or indefiniteness, and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss12')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> or regularity.  A complete stance does not <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denial', 'gloss13')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense. [Click for details.]">deny</a> any aspect of meaningness.</p>
<p>From point of view of the complete stance, eternalism and nihilism are each half right.  Eternalism rightly recognizes that the world is meaningful to us, and that it must be accepted as it is.  This is the acknowledgement of pattern: the world in all its variety, pain and pleasure alike.  Nihilism rightly recognizes that there is no eternal source of meaning, so there is no ultimate basis or necessity for rejecting anything.  This is the acceptance of nebulosity: the chaos and contingency of the world, and the recognition that we are free from divine law.</p>

<p class="intro_para">This book is about <dfn>meaningness</dfn>.  “Meaningness” is a word I invented, referring to the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.</p>
<p>The word “meaning” has two quite different meanings in English. It can refer to the meaning of symbols, such as words and road signs. This book is not about that kind of meaning. </p>
<p>People also speak of “the meaning of life.” That is the sort of meaningness this book is about. So I apply “meaningness” only to the sorts of things one could describe as “deeply meaningful” or “pretty meaningless.” The book is about matters such as purpose, ethics, and selfhood.</p>
<p>Meaningness is a quality, not a thing. I don’t think there is <em>a definite meaning</em> of life. Meaningness is always <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>: indefinite, uncertain, ambiguous. </p>
<p>The suffix <i>-ness</i> constantly reminds one of this nebulosity. I mostly avoid the word “meaning,” because it builds in the assumption that something meaning<em>ful</em> has one specific meaning. Often, <a href="#chap9_ofmeaningness">that is wrong</a>.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I use “meaningness” in three closely-related ways, referring to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the quality of being <a href="#chap25">meaningful and/or meaningless</a></li>
<li>the study of, or ideas about, this quality</li>

</ul>
<p>It should be clear from context which way I’m using the word in each case.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_acuriouslymissingword">A curiously missing word</h2>
<p>I invented the word “meaningness” because the topic of this book seemed to have no name. There seems to be no -ology or -osophy devoted to it.</p>
<p>There are various -ologies devoted to <em>meanings</em>. For example, semantics studies the meanings of words. This book is not about that.</p>
<p>The various <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss4')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> of meaningness <em>are</em> discussed in religion and philosophy; but, strangely, the topic as a whole is never addressed.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_neitherreligionnorphilosophy">Neither religion nor philosophy</h2>
<p>My approach in this book is non-religious and non-philosophical. It is meant for readers who have rejected religious answers. Those who have figured out that philosophy also lacks answers may be even more intrigued.</p>
<p>It will be obvious that the book is non-religious. It’s <em>anti</em>-religious to the extent that most religions are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalist</a>, and rejection of eternalism is one of my main themes. I take <a href="#chap60">atheism as a given</a>; it’s barely worth mentioning, much less arguing for.</p>
<p>Less obviously, the book is also non-philosophical, and perhaps even anti-philosophical. It is meant as a practical manual. I hope it is useful to anyone who struggles with questions like “what should I do with my life?” and “how ethical should I be?” and “do I have a special destiny, or is my life going to have no meaning beyond the ordinary?”</p>
<p>Isn’t it odd that philosophy has no branch devoted to meaningness?
Especially since meaningness is exactly what regular people, who haven’t studied philosophy, usually think philosophy is about? </p>
<p>In ancient times, philosophers did ask the big questions of meaningness. (I’m fond of <a href="http://members.optushome.com.au/davidquinn000/Diogenes%20Folder/Diogenes.html">Diogenes↗︎︎</a>, whose picture heads this page.) Nowadays, big questions are considered embarrassingly naive. The proper job of a philosopher is to make tiny technical corrections in esoteric theories that probably have no connection with reality.</p>
<p>In recent philosophical history, existentialism was an exception. It was willing to ask the important questions. It avoided the error of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss6')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

However, it wrongly supposed that meaningness is merely subjective, and thereby came to an acknowledged <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss7')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

For instance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics">normative moral philosophy↗︎︎</a> tries to answer some questions about ethics—one dimension of meaningness. <a href="#chap127">Later in the book</a>, I argue that nearly all current ethical theories are either eternalist or nihilist, and therefore wrong.

</div>
<p class="intro_para">I was inspired to write this book when I saw many of my friends struggling with the question “what is my true <a href="#chap2">purpose</a> in life?”</p>
<p>This struggle makes you miserable.  Finding your “true <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss0')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a>” is difficult.  It might seem that it ought to be obvious, but my friends seemed to fail repeatedly.  There is no pragmatic, straightforward means to discover your mission; you need to use non-ordinary techniques, such as psychotherapy, divination, or dream work.  At times they would be excited because they had finally found it—but a month or two later, they realized they had been mistaken.  What they had thought was their true mission turned out not to be.  Then they would lapse into depression, for months or years, during which they seemed to do nothing much—just surviving.  Of course, they said, since they didn’t know what they were <em>supposed</em> to be doing, it was not surprising that they weren’t accomplishing anything.</p>
<p>I think the reason you can’t find your mission in life is that there is no such thing.  That answer seems unacceptable, though, if there is only one alternative: <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss1')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>.</p>
<p>If there is not something I was put on earth to do, perhaps all that’s left is to join the rat-race of accumulation and personal gratification?  But everyone understands that is unsatisfying: a dead end.  We have tried materialism, and seen that it fails.  You can pursue money, sex, popularity, and power for a while, but either you find you can’t get enough, or it turns to cardboard in your mouth when you do.</p>
<p>Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.  Some people pursue mission relentlessly; others materialism.  Most flip-flop.  In any case, these alternatives both produce disappointment, depression, at times anguish.</p>
<p>This is an example of what we could call “existential suffering” or “spiritual suffering.”  It is suffering due to one’s relationship with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss2')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned.

[Click for details.]">dimension</a> of meaningness.</p>
<p>I believe this kind of suffering is unnecessary.  It is caused by wrong attitudes toward meaningness.  Those can be replaced with accurate ones, and then you are freed from it.</p>
<p>Of course, most suffering is not existential, or spiritual.  Most suffering is practical: concrete circumstances are unsatisfactory.  I haven’t got much to say about <em>practical</em> suffering, except that it often has practical solutions.  <em>Spiritual</em> suffering is eradicated by replacing supposedly-spiritual problems (like “what is my life purpose?”) with practical ones—which you may be able to make progress on.</p>
<p>Mission and materialism are not the only possibilities.  You can, instead, do things that you enjoy <em>and</em> that are useful to others.</p>
<p>“But how do I know <em>what</em> to dedicate my life to?” Wrong question… a good question to ask instead is “What is something I can do now that will be both enjoyable and useful?”  That’s a practical problem.  You can find answers without using religious or therapeutic voodoo.</p>
<p>It’s an unattractive question, however.  “What is my true mission in life?” promises that if only you can find the answer, and you throw your whole <a href="#chap104">self</a> into your mission, you will be a very <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'specialness', 'gloss4')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.

<p>“What’s something useful and enjoyable I can do now?” prompts the answer “Who cares—so what?”  Mere usefulness and enjoyability doesn’t sound <em>good enough</em>.  This “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss5')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

If you can let go of the grandiosity that leads you to imagine that some <em>special task</em> awaits you, <em>and</em> the false hope that getting enough of what you want would make life satisfactory, you can be useful and enjoy yourself.  That letting-go takes some doing; I will suggest ways to go about it.</p>
<p>This book addresses a series of dilemmas of this sort.

<p class="intro_para">Mostly, people <em>think about thinking about</em> meaning in terms of <em>systems</em>.  (By “systems,” I mean religions, philosophies, political ideologies, psychological frameworks, and so on.)  But I think that is not how we <em> actually think about</em> meaningness.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>When I say “think about thinking about,” I mean that if you ask “How do you think about questions of meaning, value, purpose, or ethics,” the answer is something like “I’m a Christian / existentialist / progressive / Jungian.”  Or more likely, nowadays when few people want to commit to a single system, they may mention several.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is a mistake.  In practice, when we actually need to make decisions, we do it mainly on the basis of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stances', 'gloss0')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stances</a>, not systems.</p>
<p>Stances are simple, compelling patterns of thinking and feelings concerning meaningness.  For example: “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ordinariness', 'gloss1')" title="Ordinariness is the  confused stance that no one is better than anyone else, and that one’s value derives from herd membership. [Click for details.]">I’m an ordinary guy</a>,” or “the only real <a href="#chap111">purpose</a> in life is to squeeze as much pleasure out of it as you can before you die,” or “good people <a href="#chap134">follow the rules</a>,” or “everyone is <a href="#chap124">responsible for their personal reality</a>.”</p>
<p>Whatever system, or systems, someone believes in, they probably often adopt stances that contradict it.  For example, Christians, in everyday life, often act on the basis of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss2')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>.  (I have never been a Christian, but I know this by reading books by Christian pastors, who say this is a big problem.)  Progressives also fall into materialism—another contradiction.  Many professed Christians say that “all is one, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss3')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>”—the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss4')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a>—which goes against the central teaching of Christianity. </p>
<p>Systems are big, complicated things with lots of details you are supposed to believe and do.  Systems have salespeople, who argue passionately in their favor.</p>
<p>Stances are very simple, and don’t require any specific beliefs or practices.  No one explicitly promotes them.  You pick them up automatically from our cultural “<a href="https://approachingaro.org/thought-soup">thought soup↗︎︎</a>.”  They are the ways people talk about meaning in soap operas and cafes.</p>
<p><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Confused stances', 'gloss5')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">Confused stances</a> are insidious, because they are unnoticed.  Because no one argues for them, no one argues against them.  They are memes, mental viruses that people propagate by talking, without awareness of them.</p>
<p>Systems <em>can</em> help stabilize particular stances.  Christianity, for instance, tries to stabilize <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss6')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>—the idea that everything has a definite meaning given by God.  Its detailed ideology provides support for this idea.  If you are Christian and wobbling out of eternalism, it provides things to say to yourself to counteract that.</p>
<p>This works only to a limited extent.  The experience of Christians is that “everyone falls into temptation.”  That is not only the temptation of unethical actions—more seriously, it is acting on the basis of stances that contradict the religion’s core teachings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the time I don’t know what I should be doing.  I mean, regular life is pretty meaningless, isn’t it?  I know I must have been put on earth for some reason.  I’m an artist, really.  I’m not one of those mindless drones who sleepwalks through life.  I can see what’s real; that’s the artist’s job.  Discover yourself, discover reality.  But I’m not sure what my artistic medium is meant to be.</p>
<p>Life basically just sucks, mostly.  It seems like there has to be a better way; we can’t be meant to be miserable all the time.  There has to be some ultimate purpose to existence.</p>
<p>I guess I do believe in God.  I mean, maybe not as some guy up in Heaven, but something way bigger than us.  Stuff doesn’t just happen; there has to be a reason for things.  I mean, ultimately, it’s all one, isn’t it?  I guess you could say I’m spiritual, sort of, but not religious.  Organized religion is stupid.  It’s all phony niceness.  Real life isn’t like that.  People walk all over you if you are too nice.  You have to look out for yourself.</p>
<p>A lot of the time I think, OK, I’ll do a regular job, I can fit in, I can make a steady salary instead of being a starving artist.  I’ve done that, you know?  But the corporate world is all rigged against you.  You can’t get ahead.  We should sweep that away and create a just society, one that works for real people, not the greedy CEOs and politicians.  They are the ones making war and polluting the earth and stuff.</p>
<p>I want to make the world a better place.  I think most people do.  I’ve got some friends who are political, you know, trying to change things.  But I don’t see that they are going to make any difference.  And anyway, in the long run, what difference could it make?  In a hundred years, we’re all dead, and no one’s going to care.  Might as well live for the moment, you know!</p>

<p>This invented speech may be somewhat exaggerated; usually stances persist a little longer, and it would be unusual to get through so many in a single moan-session.

[Click for details.]">meaningness</a> in terms of such stances, you can catch yourself (and your friends) sliding from one to another like this.  The flip-flopping is often accompanied by anxiety, which can produce defiant negativity or fake sweetness.  Those are one clue that you are caught up in a confused stance.  Stances allied to nihilism come with defiant negativity, and those allied to eternalism make you sound like a Hallmark greeting card.</p>
<p>Each confused stance tends to lead to one of a small number of following stances.  Each stance has a logic that fails as you pursue it.  As that becomes obvious, there is a natural next thought that slides you into a following stance without noticing.</p>
<p>For example, in the stance of respectability, it makes sense to have an ordinary job and fit in.  But this involves cutting off your creativity, which is unacceptable.  Recognizing this, you may move to the stance of victim-think, if you feel coerced into conformity.  That makes you angry, and you think of forcibly changing conditions, in an unrealistic way: the stance of romantic rebellion.</p>
<p>This instability is one reason <a href="#chap7">stances trump systems</a>.  No matter how determined you are to stick to a system, the stances connected with it are likely to slide out from under you.</p>
<p>Later in the book, I discuss each of the stances in detail, and as part of that I look at the logic that can lead from each to others. That lets you anticipate the wrong moves your thinking is likely to make, and helps counter them.</p>
<p>The antidotes to this whole process are the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss14" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stances', 'gloss14')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

They are unstable not because they fail to fit reality, but because they don’t offer the emotional pay-offs the confused stances do.</p>
<p>Once one has decided that the confused stances are unworkable, and that the complete stances are accurate, one can work toward stabilizing the complete ones.</p>
<p>Also, one can work on further destabilizing the confused stances, so they do not persist.  Simply recognizing them, and seeing the logic of how they flop from one to the next, is one way to do that.</p>

<ul>
<li>From a distance, clouds can look solid; close-up they are mere fog, which can even be so thin it becomes invisible when you enter it.</li>
<li>If you watch a cloud for a few minutes, it may change shape and size, or evaporate into nothing.  But it is impossible to find an exact moment at which it ceases to exist.</li>
<li>Clouds often have vague boundaries and no particular shape.</li>
<li>It can be impossible to say where one cloud ends and another begins; whether two bits of cloud are connected or not; or to count the number of clouds in a section of the sky.</li>
<li>It can be impossible to say even whether there is a cloud in a particular place, or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanings behave in these ways, too.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ofmeaningness">The nebulosity of meaningness</h2>
<p>“Meaning” can apply to many things: words, art works, or “life,” for example.  The meanings even of words can never be fully specified.  To varying degrees, they are ambiguous.  Art is more extensively indefinite.  The matters that might be called “spiritual”—which are the main topics of this book—are still more nebulous.</p>
<p>Because “spiritual” concerns are <em>so</em> insubstantial, perhaps it would be useful to look first at the nebulosity of the meaning of an art work, such as a piece of instrumental music.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you think of the piece as a whole, its meaningfulness can seem quite solid.  But when listening to it, you cannot say “this bit means this, and that bit means that.”  The meaning becomes thin and wispy, in a sense.</li>
<li>What an art work means can change over time.  Some songs that were tremendously meaningful when I was fifteen seem quite meaningless now.  The meaning of the religious carvings of the Rapanui people of Easter Island is mostly permanently lost.</li>
<li>It is very difficult to say anything about <em>what</em> instrumental music means—even when you are sure it is highly meaningful.</li>
<li>Music comes in separate pieces (such as songs), maybe with separate meanings.  But life does not come in well-defined chunks.  “Spiritual” meanings are not clearly separable; they flow or shade into each other.</li>
<li>Meaningfulness and meaninglessness also shade into each other.  Meaningness has infinite gradations of intangibility.  It can be impossible to say whether something has meaning or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often disagree about meanings.  This can be because one person is right and the other wrong.  However, often the difficulty is not that we don’t know what the true meaning is, but that it is <em>inherently</em> ambiguous.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_jydenc6" id="extra29_footnoteref2_jydenc6" title="In the language of philosophy, nebulosity is an ontological fact, not an epistemological one.

As we will see later, meaningness is not objective—but it is not <em>sub</em>jective, either.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_unwelcome">Nebulosity is unwelcome</h2>
<p>The nebulosity of meaningness causes various problems: practical, social, and psychological.  (Much of this book describes such problems.)  Often, people would like to get rid of nebulosity, or pretend that it is not there.</p>

<p>Pattern is what makes the world interpretable—what makes it make sense.  Perceiving pattern is needed for all effective action—whether you are a person or a bug.  Our brains and senses evolved largely to find the patterns that make survival and reproduction possible.</p>
<p>Patterns are everywhere in our experience.  The material world is full of patterns: shapes, processes, connections, similarities and differences.  Society, culture, thought, and concepts are also patterned.</p>
<p>Since this book is about meaningness, patterns of meaning are particularly relevant.</p>

<p>Extreme apophenia is a symptom of psychosis, hallucinogenic drugs, and much of religious experience.  But mild examples are universal.  It is impossible <em>not</em> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">see faces where there are none↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible, and common, to miss patterns that do exist.  (Science, for instance, could be described as a search for non-obvious patterns.)</p>
<p>The brain, however, seems to be wired to give patterns the benefit of the doubt.  It would rather make the mistake of seeing non-existent patterns than of rejecting real ones.  (Maybe this is because, during evolution, missing real, dangerous patterns was worse than overreacting to imaginary ones.)</p>

<!--break-->
<h2>Fixation</h2>
<p>Fixation is the strategy of insisting that meanings are clear, definite, permanent, discrete, and objectively certain.</p>
<p>Meaningness is like open ocean: vast, unpredictable, always in motion.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_c91u85d" id="extra29_footnoteref1_c91u85d" title="I have taken this metaphor from Will Buckingham’s remarkable book Finding Our Sea-Legs: Ethics, Experience and the Ocean of Stories, about the failure of ethical eternalism.">1</a>  When meaningness appears murky, chaotic, and disputable, fixation is a natural response.</p>
<p>In fixation, you cling to relatively solid fragments of meaningness and try to lash them together into a raft.  Standing shakily on a bundle of splinters, you visualize grass beneath your feet, and try not to feel the rocking of the sea.  “Here we are on dry land,” you proclaim.  “Here we will build a fortress to keep us safe from the chaos of uncertainty.”</p>
<p>You might as well try to build your castle on a cloud.  Since meaningness <em>is</em> inherently nebulous, it cannot work.  Whenever an unusually big wave comes along, it tips you off your raft and back in the sea.  Later in this book, in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a> chapter, we’ll look in detail at common ways you may respond to these inevitable failures.  Among these are sentimentality and self-righteous aggression.</p>
<p>Another common reaction: when your own attempts at fixation fail, you may invoke an <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss3')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>, such as God.  These are invented as omnipotent, external forces that fixate meaningness.  “God works in mysterious ways.  This senseless horror is all part of the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss4')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>, even though we cannot understand why.”</p>
<h2>Denial</h2>
<p>Denial is the strategy of refusing to admit that meaningness exists, or insisting that it is unimportant, for example because it is purely subjective.</p>
<p>When it is obvious that certainty is impossible, that meanings can never be established objectively, that <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss5')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimately</a> there is nothing to stand on, denial is a natural response.  Meaningness seems too fickle to be relied on.  Better to abandon it altogether.  Better to try to live in the black emptiness of outer space.</p>
<p>Attempts at denial also always fail, when the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss6')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> of meaningness becomes obvious.  No matter how far you are from a planet, the sky is spangled by pinpoint lights of distant stars.</p>
<p>Again, in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss7')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

[Click for details.]">nihilism</a> chapter, we’ll investigate common responses to failures of denial.  These include defiant rage, intellectualization, and depression.</p>
<h2>Mirror images</h2>
<p>Fixation and denial are both rejections of nebulosity; and in a sense they are the <em>same</em> rejection.  Each fixation is also a denial, and vice versa.  Each fixation denies the opposite of what it fixates.</p>

<a id="extra29_muddled_middles" name="muddled_middles"><h2>Muddled middles</h2></a>
<p>Some confused stances do arise as attempts at compromise, or at balancing or synthesizing two extremes.  I call these “muddled middles.”</p>
<p>Here’s an example.</p>
<ul id="extra29_mm">
<li>The stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss7')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a> holds that only “eternal” purposes are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss8')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> meaningful.

This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">special</a> for pursuing only lofty goals.  Its cost is a failure to engage with the mundane aspects of life.  Those aspects can be highly satisfying, and can become messy problems for yourself and others if neglected.</li>
<li>The mirror-image stance, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss10')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>, holds that only “mundane” purposes are really meaningful.  Its emotional payoff is the simplicity and directness of pursuing your own pleasures.  Its cost is losing the benefits of eternal purposes, for oneself and others.</li>
<li>The muddled middle mingles materialism and mission, and fixates both of them.  It is the attempt to satisfy both eternal and mundane purposes simultaneously.  For example, you might pursue fame leading a media campaign to save starving Africans, or pursue groupies and a lucrative recording contract as an “alternative” “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebellion', 'gloss11')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">rebellious</a>” musician.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, most motivations are mixed.  When pursuing eternal purposes, one usually hopes for some mundane reward, even if it is only a casual compliment from a friend.  This is often sleazy and covert.  Authentic compassion and creativity are possible; but there is generally a self-aggrandizing tendency operating at the same time.</p>
<p>This muddled middle preserves both the self-righteous justification of mission and the self-indulgent, self-protective grasping of materialism.  So it combines the emotional payoffs of its parent stances.  But it also combines their costs.  It tends to lose the uncomplicated enjoyment-value of animal satisfaction (because you have to pretend that is not what you seek), and also the unselfconscious compassionate joy of accomplishing eternal purposes (because you have subordinated those to a materialist agenda).</p>
<p>The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'completion', 'gloss12')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run.

<p>For any dimension, the method asks:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<li>Typically, the complete stance is actually better than the confused ones, but it seems less attractive. How can one overcome this emotional barrier, in order to adopt the complete stance?</li>

<p>This explanation may seem conceptual and abstract at this point.  I hope soon to give you an experiential, concrete understanding of it, as well.</p>
<p>This book is meant to be practically useful.  Most of it consists of detailed applications of the method to many different dimensions of meaningness.</p>

<p>General dialectics are a big deal in Continental philosophy, particularly in <a href="#extra1">German Idealism</a>.  They are popularly associated particularly with Hegel.  The system is usually described in terms of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_nct8f9h" id="extra29_footnoteref1_nct8f9h" title="According to the Wikipedia, Hegel himself had a different formulation.">1</a></p>
<p>The method of resolution used in this book critically involves the concept of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

This method cannot resolve false oppositions in which rejection of nebulosity is not the underlying problem.</p>
<p>It is possible that this method could be seen as an <em>instance</em> of some general dialectical system.  I would not find that interesting.  It is nebulosity, not dialectic, that interests me.</p>
<p>Dialectics are also a big deal in Buddhist philosophy.  The central example is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catu%E1%B9%A3ko%E1%B9%ADi#Four_Extremes">Nagarjuña’s explanation of emptiness↗︎︎</a> in terms of “not existence, non-existence, both, or neither.”</p>
<p>There is probably some sort of <a href="#chap192">connection between nebulosity and emptiness</a>.  However, I think non-existence is mostly a red herring, and Nagarjuña’s four-fold logic has no obvious similarity with the method I present.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>A couple pages back, I described <a href="#chap14">a method for resolving confusions about meaningness</a>.  That explanation may have seemed dry and abstract.</p>
<p>On this page, I sketch one example.  Although the discussion here is brief, I hope it is concrete enough that you begin to see how and why the method might work to replace unnecessary misery with joy.</p>
<h2>An example: ethics</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the dimension of <em>ethics</em>.  Here are brief answers to the series of questions asked in the method of resolution.</p>
<p>(I will give much more detailed answers <a href="#chap127">later in the book</a>.  I’ve also written <a href="https://approachingaro.org/finding-our-sea-legs-will-buckingham-review">more about this approach to ethics↗︎︎</a> elsewhere.)</p>
<h3>How does nebulosity manifest in ethics?</h3>
<p>We are often faced with moral dilemmas, in which it is unclear what we should do.  Usually these are situations in which different ethical norms conflict.  For example, one should usually be truthful, but sometimes telling the truth would result in harm.</p>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be any general way of resolving such problems.  Similar situations often seem to have dissimilar ethical implications; right action seems to have unlimited dependence on the context.</p>
<h3>Why is this unattractive?</h3>
<p>We want to do the right thing, but don’t always know what that is.  This uncertainty can provoke intense anxiety.</p>
<p>Often we do harm that later we bitterly regret, and punish ourselves accordingly.  However, we may not see how we could have avoided it, given ethical uncertainty.</p>
<h3>How are fixation and denial used to avoid acknowledging the nebulosity of ethics?</h3>
<p>One can try to fixate ethics by <a href="#chap129">formulating totalitarian ethical codes</a> that are supposed to tell you what to do in every situation.  This is attractive because it suggests that it is possible to avoid ever being morally culpable—so long as you always follow the code.</p>
<p>Or, one can <a href="#chap130">deny that ethics are meaningful at all</a>, and refuse to take moral responsibility for your actions.  This is another way of avoiding culpability.</p>
<h3>How do these confused stances fail?</h3>
<p>Ethical situations are unboundedly complex and variable.  Any finite, fixed set of rules will sometimes require actions that are obviously harmful, for no reason beyond “that’s the rule.”  In such cases, you are faced with the horrible choice of violating rules you believed sacred, or creating needless suffering by obeying them.</p>
<p>A fixed code also will fail to promote some beneficial actions in situations that present unusual opportunities.</p>
<p>Refusing to acknowledge ethical imperatives can sometimes work to one’s personal advantage.  Obviously, it tends to harm others, though.</p>
<p>It also seems that humans are incapable of consistent ethical nihilism.  Humans evolved to be ethical; that is just how our brains work.  It’s usually impossible to avoid all shame and guilt.  Even sociopaths, whose brains lack ethical function, do not often seem to have satisfactory lives.</p>
<h3>What if ethics were unavoidably nebulous?</h3>
<p>This opens the possibility of <a href="#chap131">ethical responsiveness coupled with ethical freedom</a>.</p>
<p>If ethics are unavoidably nebulous, in many situations there is no one “right thing” to do.  Instead, there are alternatives with subtle trade-offs.  We have the duty to pay close attention to the details, while also maintaining openness to the situation as a whole.</p>
<p>We also often have the privilege of choice.  Where there is no definite right answer, we are free.  We can choose at will.  We also have room for creative improvisation: finding ethical solutions that are not applications of general principles.</p>
<p>This stance requires letting go of the fantasy that we could always avoid culpability.  We have to accept that, inevitably, we will sometimes make ethical mistakes.</p>
<p>Regretting ethical mistakes makes us less likely to repeat them.  However, acknowledging their inevitability means that we can let go of ethical anxiety.  Ethical maturity is measured by the ability to find good-enough solutions to ethical problems, not by the amount you punish yourself.</p>
<h3>What helps adopt the complete stance?</h3>
<p>We need to <em>destabilize</em> the confused stances, by understanding their defects, and <em>stabilize</em> the complete one, by understanding its advantages.</p>
<p>In this case, confusion is destabilized by understanding that it is not feasible to achieve blamelessness, either by following the rules or by denying ethics altogether.  Both approaches inevitably cause needless harm to oneself and others.</p>
<p>The complete stance is stabilized by understanding that ethical freedom can be a source of benevolent joy, not mean-spirited selfishness.  It is stabilized by understanding that ethical responsiveness eliminates anxiety, and is not an intolerable burden of infinite responsibility without control.</p>

Each of those reinforces the others, and helps maintain the stance.</p>
<p>The methods described in this book mainly work by changing thinking. It’s also possible to work with feelings and actions; I’ll make occasional suggestions about those too.</p>
<p>The main method is to become familiar with the thoughts and feelings characteristic of each confused stance, so that you notice them as they occur; and then choose to think differently. Simply <em>remembering</em> that there is a better alternative—a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss3')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

However, it’s also necessary to understand how and why this alternative is better, and that can take some work. If the complete stances were <em>obviously</em> better, no one would adopt the confused ones.</p>
<!--break-->
<p><a href="#chap18">The next page</a> explains the method in more detail, in terms of various “aspects” of each stance.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_similarmethods">Similar methods</h2>
<h3 id="extra29_cognitiverestructuring">Cognitive restructuring</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_restructuring">Cognitive restructuring↗︎︎</a> is the central method of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">cognitive-behavioral therapy↗︎︎</a> (CBT). Cognitive restructuring is also a practice of “thinking differently,” by noticing patterns of dysfunctional, emotion-laden thought, and replacing them with more accurate and functional ones. CBT, like <cite>Meaningness</cite>, suggests that patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior reinforce each other. Interestingly, like my approach, CBT draws on Eastern religion and Western philosophy.</p>
<p>The specific patterns of thinking/feeling/acting CBT works with, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion">cognitive distortions↗︎︎</a>, have almost no overlap with my confused stances. So the method is similar, but the content is mainly quite different. (One point of commonality: CBT aims to overcome “absolutism,” perhaps similar to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss4')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>. In place of absolutism, it promotes “flexibility,” perhaps similar to the complete stance’s attitude toward <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss5')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>.)</p>
<p>Unlike CBT, <cite>Meaningness</cite> is not intended as therapy, and is not concerned with psychopathology. However, because the method is similar, the two might be complementary or synergistic. Perhaps <cite>Meaningness</cite> offers CBT practitioners an expanded set of dysfunctional patterns to address; I’m not qualified to say.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_rationalism">Rationalism</h3>
<p>Several communities aim to improve normal (non-psychopathological) thinking, using a similar method. They identify common patterns of dysfunctional thought; each can be replaced with a better alternative. Among these communities are the rationalist, skeptical, and critical thinking movements.</p>
<p>In early versions, these movements concentrated on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">logical fallacies↗︎︎</a>—errors in thinking alone. Increasingly, they have recognized the importance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases↗︎︎</a>, many of which involve emotions distorting thought.</p>
<p>The lists of these errors (linked in the previous paragraph) have little overlap with my <a href="#chap22">list of confused stances</a>. It seems likely that rationalism, skepticism, and critical thinking can be synergistic with the <cite>Meaningness</cite> approach. (That is my experience, anyway!) However, rationalism can sometimes slide into <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss4')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>, a dysfunctional, confused stance. I’ll discuss later <a href="#chap63">how to avoid that danger</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, insights about cognitive biases have crossed over with CBT, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias_modification">cognitive bias modification↗︎︎</a> therapy. Maybe a three-way synergy is possible!</p>
<h2 id="extra29_meditation">Meditation</h2>
<p>This book grew partly out of my engagement with Buddhist philosophy. That philosophy is closely related to <a href="http://aromeditation.org/">Buddhist meditation methods↗︎︎</a>. I have found that the two support each other—as Buddhism says.</p>
<p>In meditation, you watch yourself thinking, without interfering. Then you discover <em>what</em> you are thinking, and <em>how</em>. It comes as a shock to most people to realize that they actually didn’t know—and another shock to learn the typical contents of their thoughts.</p>
<p>Because meditation reveals the process and content of your thoughts, it’s probably synergistic with any of the three “think differently” methods (<cite>Meaningness</cite>, CBT, and rationalism). And, indeed, meditation is increasingly combined with CBT to create various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy">crossover therapies↗︎︎</a>. There’s also considerable interest in meditation in the rationalist community.</p>
<p>According to Buddhist theory, meditation eventually allows you to experience “<a href="#chap192">emptiness</a>,” which is closely related to my “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss5')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>”; and after that “the nonduality of emptiness and form,” which is related to the inseparability of nebulosity and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss8')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a>. That inseparability is the hallmark of the complete stances.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_action">Action</h2>
<p>Confused stances make you miserable directly; but even worse, they make you take dysfunctional actions that harm yourself and others. Some helpful interventions can replace dysfunctional actions with functional ones. These include both individual activities and social or group practices.</p>
<p class="meta_para">My current (July 2014) plan for this book does not include much material about action, but I’m coming to think it should. So, this may change.</p>

<p>When you <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss17" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'adopt', 'gloss17')" title="“Adopting” a stance means using its pattern of feeling and thinking to address the dimension of meaningness it relates to.

It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

Likewise, when you are depressed for other reasons, nihilism may seem obviously right.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_appeal">Sales pitch and emotional appeal</h2>
<p>The “sales pitch” is a slogan that encapsulates the language used to promote the stance.</p>
<p>A confused stance’s emotional appeal is the reason it is attractive. Each confused stance plays to some need for security, excitement, or self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p>Noticing that you are getting sucked in by the emotional promise made by a confused stance, and knowing that it cannot deliver on them, helps free you from it.</p>
<p>The complete stances are, unfortunately, less emotionally appealing. (Otherwise, we’d adopt them easily.) However, they are more realistic.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_suffering">How a confused stance causes suffering</h2>
<p>Confused stances distort experience by fixating and denying particular sorts of meaningness. When these mistaken perceptions collide with reality, <a href="#chap5">emotional pain results</a>.</p>
<p>Each confused stance produces a characteristic pattern of misunderstanding and misery.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_obstacles">Obstacles to maintaining a stance</h2>
<p>The confused stances constantly collide with reality. It is impossible not to see this, and impossible not to suffer the consequences. This makes it impossible to remain consistently in a confused stance; they are <a href="#chap8">always unstable</a>.</p>
<p>A confused stance’s patterns of collision with reality—the obstacles to maintaining it—are resources for switching into a complete stance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are obstacles to adopting the complete stances, as well. Generally, complete stances are conceptually obscure, and appear emotionally unsatisfying.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_next">Likely next stances</h2>
<p>Because stances are unstable, we frequently stumble from one to another, without being clearly aware that we are doing this. In fact, all of the confused stances described in this book will be thoroughly familiar to every reader.</p>
<p>When a particular obstacle to maintaining one stance arises, there are typical routes into likely next stances. Knowing this, one can recognize an upcoming transition into a confused stance, and re-direct oneself into a complete stance instead.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_antidotes">Antidotes and counter-thoughts</h2>
<p>These are ways of getting yourself out of a confused stance. </p>
<p>Simply recognizing that you are caught in one, and remembering that there is a better alternative, is often most of the battle.</p>
<p>Beyond that, one can notice particular confused patterns, and cut through them with specific counter-thoughts.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_4g39wzf" id="extra29_footnoteref1_4g39wzf" title="This is similar to “cognitive shifting,” a psychotherapeutic approach. Apparently its development was influenced by Eastern religion—as Meaningness also was.">1</a> Counter-thoughts can work in two ways. Some move from a confused stance to the complete stance. Others destabilize the confused stance, to make it less attractive so that you are more likely to jump to the complete stance spontaneously. (In those cases, though, one needs to guard against simply moving to a different confused stance.)</p>
<h2 id="extra29_intelligent">Intelligent features of a confused stance</h2>
<p>Each confused stance is intelligent in some way. If it did not have a powerful logic to it, an almost-truth, we would not get stuck in it. Each approximates a complete stance, which is actually correct.</p>
<p>Noticing how the confused stance you have adopted is <em>nearly</em> right is helpful in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It avoids “I’m a bad person because I fell into a confused stance again,” which is discouraging, and more likely to make you abandon the practice than to continue.</li>
<li>It lets you see <em>why</em> you’ve adopted it.</li>
<li>It helps point the way to a complete stance that shares the same accurate insight.</li>

<!--break-->
<a id="extra29_adopting" name="adopting"><h2>Adopting</h2></a>
<p>To <dfn>adopt</dfn> a stance is to use it, at a particular moment, as a way of addressing a problem of meaningness.</p>
<p>For example, to adopt the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss2')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a> means to think about <a href="#chap111">purpose</a> in terms of “mundane” or personal benefit.</p>
<p>As I explained earlier, <a href="#chap8">stances are unstable</a>.  Frequently one adopts a stance only for a few seconds or minutes, before abandoning it for another one.

</p><p>Mostly, people are not aware of the stances they adopt.</p>
<a id="extra29_committing" name="committing"><h2>Committing (and rejecting)</h2></a>
<p>To <dfn>commit</dfn> to a stance means to decide to adopt it consistently in the future.  For example, you might resolve always to adopt <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss3')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a> as an approach to purpose, rather than materialism.</p>
<p>The various stances that concern a particular <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimension', 'gloss4')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimension</a> of meaningness contradict each other, and are mutually exclusive.  Committing to one implies <dfn>rejecting</dfn> the others.  For example, committing to thinking of yourself as <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ordinariness', 'gloss5')" title="Ordinariness is the  confused stance that no one is better than anyone else, and that one’s value derives from herd membership.

This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">specialness</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nobility', 'gloss7')" title="Nobility is the stance that resolves specialness and ordinariness.  Nobility consists in using whatever capacities one has on behalf of others. [Click for details.]">nobility</a>.</p>
<h2>Commitment via systems</h2>
<p>Although people <em>actually</em> think about meaningness in terms of stances, mostly they <em>think</em> they think about meaningness in terms of “<a href="#chap7">systems</a>.”  Systems include religions, philosophies, ideologies, spiritual and psychological frameworks, and so forth.</p>
<p>Because people are mostly not aware of stances, it is somewhat unusual to commit to a stance directly.  Instead, people commit to systems, which in turn demand certain stances.</p>
<p>An obvious example: most Western religions require the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss8')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>.  To be a good Christian, you are supposed to adopt eternalism whenever questions of meaningness arise.</p>
<p>Two more examples: some psychological ideologies require the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'true self', 'gloss9')" title='The “deep" or “true” or “authentic” self is an imaginary, inaccessible superior identity, which has a magical connection with the Cosmic Plan.  “Depth psychology” is particularly big on the true self, but this confused idea has become wide-spread. [Click for details.]'>true self</a>; some political ideologies require the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebellion', 'gloss10')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">romantic rebellion</a>.</p>
<a id="extra29_accomplishing" name="accomplishing"><h2>Accomplishing</h2></a>
<p>To <dfn>accomplish</dfn> a stance means that you actually <em>do</em> consistently adopt it, every time its dimension of meaningness becomes an issue.  For example, accomplishing <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss11')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a> would mean that you <em>always</em> regard everything as meaningless.</p>
<p>Accomplishing a stance is difficult.  Obvious, everyday evidence constantly contradicts all the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss12')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stances</a>.  The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stances', 'gloss13')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stances</a> are subtle and emotionally unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>In most cases, I think accomplishment is impossible in practice.  Human beings are not actually put together in a way that makes it possible to see everything as meaningless.  (Or as meaningful, as would be required to accomplish eternalism.)</p>
<a id="extra29_wavering" name="wavering"><h2>Wavering</h2></a>
<p>If you have committed to a stance, and have not accomplished it, you must apply effort to adopt it in cases in which it doesn’t seem to fit; and you often fail.  I call this <dfn>wavering</dfn>.</p>
<p>Wavering causes emotional and cognitive problems.  I explain what these problems are, for each specific stance, in the main part of this book.</p>
<p>These problems can be overcome.  For confused stances, I show how to recognize them, and how to use them as a spur to adopting the corresponding complete stance instead.  For complete stances, I show how to resolve the difficulties.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_appropriating">Appropriating</h2>
<p>Each confused stance, although mistaken and usually damaging when adopted, is based on a valuable insight.  (Otherwise, it would not be attractive at all.)</p>
<p>For example, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss14" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss14')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a>, the idea that “all is One,” is based on the accurate insight that we are not isolated individuals, that there is no hard boundary between self and other, and that things are connected in innumerable ways, many of which we cannot know.</p>
<p>When one adopts a complete stance, the intelligent aspects of confused stances can be <dfn>appropriated</dfn> as tools.  A complete stance is “complete” in that it incorporates the intelligent parts of the opposed confused stances for that dimension of meaningness.  From the standpoint of the complete stance, the confused stances (which everyone understands) can be used to communicate the complete insight, and to draw others to it.</p>
<p>For example, although it is not true that “all is One,” the language of monism may be useful in explaining that things are non-separate—which is true.</p>

<p>These combinations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss4')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual.

</ul>
<!--break-->
<p>Each of the three primary combinations typically comes with a corresponding collection of secondary stances; I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<h2>The apparent lack of alternatives</h2>
<p>Regarding the fundamental questions of meaning—does it exist, and where does it come from?—these three are the only well-known possibilities.  I think all three are wrong; this book advocates a fourth combination of stances (about which I’ll say something at the end of this page).</p>
<p>Each of the Big Three has serious, obvious defects.  However, people often <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'commitment', 'gloss8')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up. [Click for details.]">commit</a> to one of them primarily because it looks less bad than the other two.</p>
<p>Understanding this, you can see that much of the rhetoric supporting systems boils down to “less bad”:

</p><ul>
<li>“God must exist, because otherwise there is no purpose in living, and you have no way of telling right from wrong.”</li>
<li>“A God who is someone somewhere else cannot end your alienation from other beings.  Enlightenment is possible only here, now.  Only by <em>being</em> God can you overcome the isolation and limitations of material embodiment.”</li>
<li>“You have to admit that everything is meaningless, because we know God is a fairy tale.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>No monist nihilism</h2>
<p>Considering the two primary axes eternalism/nihilism and monism/dualism, there is a fourth possibility: monist nihilism.  That is the view that “all is One, and it is meaningless.” Although this is conceptually coherent, it has few (if any) advocates.  Apparently it is not emotionally attractive in the way the other combinations are.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_dggq4uu" id="extra29_footnoteref1_dggq4uu" title="You might enjoy working out some consequences of monist nihilism.  If you are a philosophy geek, you might also wonder whether there are any historical figures who fit the category.">1</a></p>
<p>So, in practice, monism always implies eternalism, and nihilism always implies dualism.  In the rest of this book, I’ll often speak simply of “monism” or “nihilism,” and you can take the eternalism and dualism for granted.</p>
<h2>Other stances in the Big Three combinations</h2>
<p>In addition to the four stances to fundamental questions of meaningness, there are stances to more specific <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss3')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> such as purpose, ethics, and the nature of the self.  These are commonly folded in with the Big Three combinations when people build ideological systems.</p>
<p>In some cases, the choices are forced.  If you think nothing is meaningful (nihilism) then you have to accept that can be no ethics (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ethical nihilism', 'gloss10')" title="Ethical nihilism is the stance that ethics are a meaningless human invention and have no real claim on us. [Click for details.]">ethical nihilism</a>).</p>
<p>More often, the choices of stance toward specific dimensions of meaningness are <em>logically</em> independent.  For example, both <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'reasonable respectability', 'gloss11')" title="The stance that one should contribute to social order by conforming to traditions. [Click for details.]">reasonable respectability</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebellion', 'gloss12')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">romantic rebellion</a> are logically consistent with eternalism.</p>
<p>However, each of the Big Three has a typical <dfn>emotional texture</dfn>, which may be more or less compatible with other stances.  Dualist eternalism generally combines with reasonable respectability, <em>not</em> romantic rebellion; that is far more likely to go along with nihilism.  Dualist eternalism has meaning coming from some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss13')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>, and you had better obey what it says.</p>
<p>Most (if not all) systems are somewhat incoherent, and one system may take opposing stances to different specific cases.  The <a href="#chap8">psychological instability of stances</a> reinforces this.</p>
<h2>Dualist eternalism: typical combinations</h2>
<p>The typical<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_9ihofzp" id="extra29_footnoteref2_9ihofzp" title="These textures are tendencies, not absolutes.  Some committed dualist eternalists are free from self-righteousness, for instance.">2</a>  emotional texture of dualist eternalism is <dfn>self-righteousness</dfn>.

God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, dualist eternalism combines with:</p>
<ul>

</div>
<p class="intro_para">Two years ago, well into a mainly happy marriage, you began a secret affair.</p>
<p>The attraction was overwhelming.  The sex was scalding.  You loved with a passion you had never felt before.</p>
<p>Your lover—also married—understood parts of you that your spouse did not.  You were able to be a different person.  You explored aspects of your personality that you had never been able to express before.  You made different sorts of jokes.  You went on adventurous dates, trying things your spouse—who you knew was sweet but a bit dull when you got married—would never have agreed to do.</p>
<p>After a year and a bit, the passion waned.  Your secret meetings began to feel slightly repetitive.  You found that your personalities would not be compatible in the long term.  You wanted quite different things out of life.</p>
<p>It began to seem you were going through the motions.  You had one meaningless fight about nothing.  Then you discussed the future, and agreed to end the affair on good terms.</p>
<p>Now, you wonder: <em>what did that mean?</em></p>
<!--break-->
<h2>Where did the meaning go?</h2>
<p>In the beginning, the affair seemed enormously significant.  By the end, it had slid into a casual friendship plus sex.</p>
<p>Were you wrong to think it was meaningful at the start?  Was it always meaningless?  Or did it have a meaning that it lost?</p>
<p>Perhaps the original meaning lives on in memory, and in the changes in you?  You know that the effects of the affair will reverberate for years to come.  But what meaning will it have in ten, twenty, thirty years, when life has moved on to other dramas?  What could it mean after everyone involved is dead?</p>
<p>How could meaningfulness come and go?  To be more than just an opinion, or a feeling, shouldn’t meanings stay the same eternally?</p>
<h2>The ethical dimension</h2>
<p>“Eternal” reminds you uncomfortably that, of course, there is an ethical dimension to adultery.  From the beginning, and all through the affair, you could not ignore that.</p>
<p>You grew up Christian, and you know that any pastor would say that adultery is always wrong.  But you left the Church in your teens, when you decided you had to say what was right and wrong in the Bible, not the other way around.</p>
<p>You also have friends who say a married affair is definitely OK—so long as some conditions are met.</p>
<p>But you yourself find it hard to decide whether this one was right, or wrong, or perhaps somehow somewhere in-between.</p>
<div class="sidebar-location" id="extra29_sidebar_location_1"></div>
<p>It was mostly a remarkable and enjoyable experience (with some slightly yuck moments toward the end).  If it were not for the ethical concerns, you certainly wouldn’t regret it.</p>
<p>More importantly, you think, its lasting consequences were mainly good.  Your lover was quite different in bed from anyone you had been with, and you learned to be more open when making love yourself.  That has improved sex in your marriage; your spouse is happy about that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you had been caught, it would have hurt several people besides you.  Putting innocents at risk must be part of the moral equation.</p>
<p>And there is another lasting effect.  You aren’t sure if it is good or bad.  Your affair confirmed that something important is missing in your marriage—something you will never get from your spouse.  Before, you suspected; now you know.  Now, you cannot un-know that.</p>
<p>That is bad for the marriage; but maybe it is good for you.  Maybe even for your spouse, in the long run.</p>
<p>You cannot help wondering about other possibilities.  Is it realistic to want lasting passion <em>and</em> compatibility?</p>
<p>You do not want to become a serial adulterer in an attempt to find out.</p>
<h2>Ethics: what are they good for?</h2>
<p>You are introduced to a rather odd woman at a cocktail party.  She is deathly pale, with a black leather miniskirt and extensive, spiky tattoos.  She sounds normal enough, though, and explains that she teaches philosophy at a local university.</p>
<p>“Oh?  That’s interesting,” you say.  “What kind of philosophy?”</p>
<p>“Well, um, ethics, actually.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” you say.  “Um—I wonder if I could ask you a professional question?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you want personal advice—” she begins, frowning.</p>
<p>“No, sorry!  Not like that.  You see, I got really interested in ethics recently.  I kind of geeked out on it, actually.  I read a bunch on the web, and then a couple books.  So I learned all about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics">virtue ethics↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics">deontology↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">consequentialism↗︎︎</a> and stuff.  But what I don’t understand is how you would use all that to figure out what to do in a real-life ethical quandary.  It seems awfully abstract.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” she says, grinning.  “You have discovered our dirty little secret.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, most ethicists have the same problem.  Our professional work usually isn’t much help when ethical push comes to practical shove.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” you say.</p>
<h2>“How does that make you feel?”</h2>
<p>You call your friend Susie.  After some small talk, you come around to the point.  “Susie—I’m not sure how to ask this, but—you remember you told me once about a therapist who was helpful to you?”</p>
<p>She laughs.  “Yes, of course.  After my first was born—”</p>
<p>“Sam,” you remember.</p>
<p>“Right, Sam.  Can you believe he’s in second grade now?  Anyway, I had post-partum depression, and Janet was really helpful.  Are you OK?  Do you want me to give you her number?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m OK, I think.  I mean, there’s nothing wrong with me—”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be crazy to see a therapist, you know!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. But what I remember is your saying that everything seemed meaningless.  And—”</p>
<p>“I had all these expectations about what being a mother would be like.  And the reality wasn’t anything like that.  She helped me figure out how I felt about that.”</p>
<p>“Right, so I’m kind of wondering what something in my life means, I mean meant, so I thought—”</p>
<p>“Sure, of course.  Hang on and I’ll look her up.  If I can just figure out how this damn phone works…”</p>
<p>Talking with the therapist doesn’t go as smoothly.</p>
<p>“How does that make you feel?” is her mantra.  After answering that dozens of times, over several sessions, you finally rebel.  “I <em>know</em> how it makes me feel.  What I want to know is what it <em>means</em>.”</p>
<p>“Well, what does it mean to <em>you</em>?” she asks.</p>
<p>“But that’s just it,” you say. “I want to know what it <em>actually</em> means.  Not just to me.  I mean, meaning isn’t just a feeling.  Ethics can’t be like that.  Some things are just right or wrong, no matter what you feel about them.”</p>
<p>“That seems like quite a polarizing view,” the therapist says.  “Maybe things aren’t so black and white…  I see our hour is almost up.  Next time, perhaps it would be helpful for you to tell me about your parent’s marriage.”</p>
<p>You decide there won’t be a next time.</p>
<h2>Meaningness is not mostly ethics</h2>
<p>Ethics, you realize, couldn’t answer the question “what did that mean?” anyway.  Even if you could be sure whether the affair was right or wrong, the one word “right” or “wrong” would hardly begin to express the meaning of the relationship.  Even an explanation of <em>why</em> it was right or wrong would still ignore most of what seemed to matter about it.</p>
<p>The meaning of the affair seems to have many <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss0')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> besides ethics.  Yet you find it hard to say what those would be.</p>
<p>Certainly, <em>how you feel about it</em> is another dimension.  And how your former lover feels too.</p>
<p>But what it <em>says about you</em> seems more important.  You didn’t think you were the sort of person who would cheat—and you still don’t.  But apparently you are—because you did.</p>
<p>What else does that imply about you?  Are you less trust-worthy than you thought, in other ways?</p>
<p>You felt, in the initial rush, that you had no choice.  You tried as hard as you could, you thought, to resist your feelings, and failed.  <em>Could</em> you have done differently?  Is it just sleazy self-justification to say that you would have had to have been a different person to have chosen differently—and that it is not possible to be anyone other than you are?</p>
<p>But now, in fact, you are <em>not</em> the same person you were.  The affair changed you; and that is another dimension of its meaning.  Your risk-loving lover gave you a confidence you did not have before.  And the affair exposed parts of yourself you were only vaguely aware of.  Now those often come into play as you think and feel and relate.</p>
<p>Beyond all that, you suspect there are dimensions of meaning that transcend the personal; that go beyond the effects on anyone involved.</p>
<p>Marriage is a sacrament, according to the Church.  It is a contract with God as well as another person.  You don’t exactly believe in God any more… but marriage doesn’t seem to just be an agreement between two people, either.  Maybe it is society, not God, to whom you are responsible?  Marriage is a foundation of society.  But whose business is it what you do, if it has no consequences for them?</p>
<p>Besides which, the affair itself seemed at first to have <a href="#chap137">a sacred dimension</a>.  Sometimes, making love, the sense that you were separate people dropped away.  There was simply intense sensation and exquisite action—with no one there to feel or act.  And then sometimes it seemed that it was the entire universe making love.  Awareness extended into infinity, and there was the presence of the God you don’t believe in.</p>
<p>But surely that was an illusion.  This is just self-justification, isn’t it?  It makes no sense at all to talk of self-indulgent pleasure as sacred.</p>
<h2>A life lesson</h2>
<p>During the affair, you told no one.  It was a private thing, just for you and your lover.  But now, needing perspective, you confide in two close friends.</p>
<p>Over lunch, you tell Chris the short version.  You want to be clear that you are not looking for sympathy or support or advice.  You need help figuring out what it meant.</p>
<p>“It’s a life lesson,” says Chris.  “The universe always sends you the exact experiences you need to develop your true self.  It’s the way you find out what you were really meant to do.”</p>
<p>“But what’s the lesson, then?” you ask.  “What <em>am</em> I supposed to do?”</p>
<p>“That’s up to you,” says Chris.  “You are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'total responsibility', 'gloss1')" title="Total responsibility is the stance that we each create our own reality and are solely responsible for everything that happens in it. [Click for details.]">totally responsible for your own reality</a>, you know.  But you have to use your intuition.  I think you think too much, sometimes.  I mean, really, reading philosophy books is not going to help you find the meaning of an affair!  If you go deeply into your feelings, you will find the answer.  Maybe that’s the lesson, in itself!”</p>
<p>Lunch ends a little awkwardly.  Chris has fit your experience to a generic spiritual story.  Nothing in it takes account of any of the details, of the complex texture of your relationships and your life.  What you want to know about is <em>the meaning of your affair</em>, not about meaning in general.  You are a bit annoyed that Chris doesn’t understand, or is ignoring what you care about; and you can’t completely hide it.  Chris always was a bit of an airhead, you think.  In retrospect, not the right person to consult.</p>
<p>You are aware that Chris, in turn, is a bit annoyed, because you are dismissing valuable spiritual insight.  You seem excessively skeptical, materialistic, and self-involved.</p>
<p>There is an unspoken agreement: “we won’t talk about this again—and we’ll avoid other topics that would expose our different takes on life.”</p>
<h2>Life is for living</h2>
<p>You meet Kim for drinks after work.  Kim is sensible, and you know won’t get mystical on you.</p>
<p>At first, the discussion seems to go well.  Unlike Chris, Kim wants to know about the details.  <em>Exactly</em> what was so great about the sex?  Where did you go on dates?  How did you keep the secret?</p>
<p>After an hour, you start again to be a bit frustrated.  What you want to know is <em>what it meant</em>.  The details matter—but not <em>every</em> detail matters.  It would take a year to tell the total story of a year-long affair; and then what?  The story itself is not what matters; it is what it <me>means.</me></p>
<p>“Why does it have to ‘mean’ something?” asks Kim.  “Why can’t you just let it be what it was?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s the question, isn’t it?” you say.  “What <em>was</em> it?”</p>
<p>“It’s just life,” says Kim.  “Life is for living, I guess.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” you ask.  “That’s what I want to know—<em>how</em> should I live life?”</p>
<p>“You mean, like, is it wrong to have an affair?” asks Kim.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s part of it,” you say.</p>
<p>“Geez, I don’t know,” says Kim.  “I guess you only get one life, and the point is to enjoy it.  So you have to look out for yourself, and get what you want, some of the time.  And, of course, you have to have some kind of ethics.  But no harm, no fault.  Anyway, it’s over now—why worry about it?”</p>
<p>You nod agreement, but silently you think: <i>That seems too easy</i>.</p>
<p>“So when you did it in the stairwell at Chez Jean’s, were you, like, standing against the wall, or lying down on the landing, or what?” asks Kim.</p>
<h2>What kind of world is this?</h2>
<p>Neither of your friends’ views was helpful.  Chris has a big-picture theory of meaning, which probably came out of <a href="#extra3">some self-help book</a>, but it doesn’t seem to explain anything about your affair.  Kim isn’t interested in any meaning beyond the mundane and obvious.</p>
<p>Neither view seems exactly <em>wrong</em>, but both seem to miss what is important.  You wonder if somehow they could be combined.  Is there a way to understand meaning that takes account of both the big picture and the details?</p>
<p>To be useful, a big picture story has to help make sense of specifics.  But, it occurs to you, the meaning of the specifics says a lot about what the big picture has to be.</p>
<p>The world is a very different place depending on whether your affair was definitely wrong (or right), or if that is just a personal opinion—or a cultural agreement.</p>
<p>The world is a very different place depending on whether “the universe” sends you ideal life lessons, or “the universe” is some rocks and gas scattered through vast empty space.</p>
<p>The world is a very different place depending on whether you <em>could</em> have chosen not to begin the affair, or if (being who you are) you could not have acted differently.</p>
<p>The world is a very different place depending on whether somehow the meaning of the affair could become perfectly clear—or if it was inherently <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a>.  In the story, the meaning of the secret affair seems “nebulous”: ambiguous, uncertain, changing as it unfolds and then recedes into the past.</p>
<p>The page is <em>not about</em> adultery.  It just uses that as an example, of nebulosity.</p>
<p>You may have a definite opinion about whether or when adultery can ever be ethical.  Nevertheless, you also know that other people have different opinions.</p>
<p>And, I hope you agree that “right” or “wrong” cannot capture all the meaning of a relationship.  It has many dimensions that remain nebulous even if the ethics seem unambiguous.</p>
<p>I wrote about an married affair because it is something everyone understands.  It is familiar from gossip and fiction, if not personal experience.  The puzzle of <em>what did that mean?</em> is instantly recognizable.</p>
<p>The topic is not ideal, though, because it is emotionally hot, and the ethical issue may crowd out other points.</p>
<p>There is a danger here of misunderstanding me as offering an ethical opinion.  Because the page does not take a clear position, you might misunderstand me as suggesting that the affair should not be judged as either right or wrong.  I am not.</p>
<p>This page is <em>not about</em> ethics, either.  It’s about the puzzling quality of <em>not knowing</em>, and not knowing how anyone could know.  My opinion about the ethics of the affair is irrelevant.  What matters is that its overall meaning could be unclear, at least <em>to some people</em>.</p>
<p>You might wonder whether the story is autobiographical, or based on some particular affair I heard about.  It isn’t.  I myself have never been married, and have never had a secret affair outside my main relationship.  However, I have certainly had relationships whose meaning I didn’t understand (and still don’t).  And I have faced other difficult issues in sexual ethics.</p>

<p class="intro_para">Some things are meaningful; some are meaningless.  Some are <a href="#chap24">vaguely in-between</a>.</p>
<p>This is our constant, natural experience in everyday life.  It is only in religion, spirituality, and philosophy that people insist that everything is meaningful, or that nothing is.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Insisting that everything is meaningful is <dfn>eternalism</dfn>.  Insisting that nothing is meaningful is <dfn>nihilism</dfn>.</p>

<h2>Everyday examples</h2>
<p>Some experiences are pretty much meaningless.  This is true even when they have a positive or negative effect on you.</p>
<p>Your usual bus left two minutes late; the Coke machine mistakenly gave you an extra coin in change; you spilled some of it on your shirt.</p>
<p>So what?  Such things just happen.  They don’t happen for any particular reason; they’re effectively random.  They don’t have any implications beyond their immediate, small effect on you.  They don’t tell you anything about yourself or about the universe, beyond the obvious.</p>
<p>You go for a hike alone in the desert, and your arm gets trapped between two rocks.  You cannot free it, and after waiting several days for an improbable rescue, you realize you have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston">the choice of cutting off your own arm with a dull knife, or dying of thirst.↗︎︎</a></p>
<p>Although an accident, this is a meaningful choice.  If you survive, you will remember it as a meaningful experience.  Though it was an entirely personal adventure, with no direct effect on anyone else, millions of other people are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/127_Hours">likely to find it meaningful as well↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>We speak of “major life events”—marriage; giving birth; death of parent, child, or spouse; life-threatening illness; financial triumph or catastrophe.  These are experiences most people would agree were highly meaningful.</p>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>Some things are more meaningful than others, evidently.  You might say that meaningfulness and meaninglessness are a matter of degree, not either/or.</p>
<p>That’s not quite right, either, though.  In many cases, it is <a href="#chap24">difficult to say how meaningful</a> an event was.  This might not be a problem with <em>knowing</em> how meaningful it was, but an inherent <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of the situation itself.</p>
<p>None of this is mysterious, or should be controversial.  In fact, in ordinary circumstances, probably everyone would agree.</p>
<p>Still, there are situations that make it tempting to say that everything is meaningful, or that nothing is.  These situations give rise to eternalism and nihilism.  The rest of this chapter explains why these temptations arise, why we should resist them, and how.</p>

<p class="intro_para">Why would anyone want to claim that everything is meaningful, or that everything is meaningless, defying our everyday experience that <a href="#chap25">some things are meaningful and some not</a>?</p>
<p>Here I’ll give an example of extreme meaninglessness, and one of extreme meaningfulness.  Because it is difficult to deny their meaninglessness and meaningfulness, these help uncover the reasons people might want to do that.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_eternalism">Fear of meaninglessness motivates eternalism</h2>
<p>A tiny gray pebble slides half an inch down a slope on a lifeless planet a million light-years from the nearest star.  No being ever knows about this, and nothing happens as a result of it.</p>
<p>If anything is meaningless, this is it.  So why on earth would you claim this must be meaningful?  Only if it is important that <em>absolutely everything</em> is meaningful.  And why would that be?</p>
<p>This insistence is motivated by fear: the fear that <em>perhaps everything is meaningless</em>.</p>
<p>If we could <em>definitely</em> say which things are meaningful and which are meaningless, there would be no problem.  The meaninglessness of the pebble’s slide would not threaten the meaningfulness of our own lives.</p>
<p>But we cannot always say <a href="#chap24">what has meaning and what does not</a>.  We have no hard-line test.  Meaningfulness is frustratingly unreliable; transient, uncertain.</p>
<p>There are clues.  In everyday experience, it seems that things are meaningful only if they are meaningful <em>to someone</em>.  And, mostly things are meaningful only if they have some effect, positive or negative, on someone.  The pebble’s slide is meaningless because it fails those tests.</p>
<p>But what about your own life?  Things happen that <em>seem</em> meaningful to you.  But often they do not seem meaningful to other people—especially if they affect only you.  And it is certainly possible to <a href="#chap30">be mistaken about meaningfulness</a>—to suppose things have meanings that they don’t.  So isn’t it possible that you are entirely mistaken about meaningfulness?  Isn’t it possible that life itself is completely meaningless?  That is a profoundly depressing idea.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” you think.  “I know that my life is meaningful <em>to me</em>.”  But what good is that?  No one else cares about your life the way you do.  Maybe your supposed “meaningfulness” is a delusion.  Maybe it is <a href="#chap27_summary">purely subjective,</a> and exists only in your own mind.  And then, so what?  That seems like a meaningless kind of “meaning.”</p>
<p>This is a slippery slope you don’t want to slide down.  Since there seem to be no definite criteria for meaningfulness, you cannot rely on <em>anything</em> to have meaning.  There is no solid ground under foot, once you admit the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of meaningness.</p>
<p>Better to stick a stake in the ground at the top of the hill.  If <em>everything</em> is meaningful, then there is no need to sort out what is or isn’t.  There is no need to grapple with ambiguity and uncertainty.  There is a reliable foundation on which you can build a meaningful life.</p>
<p>This is the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss1')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a> of <dfn>eternalism</dfn>.  Eternalism provides a reassuring firmness, certainty, definiteness to meaning.  It says: you are right to care about what you do, because it is <em>truly</em> meaningful.</p>
<p>But what makes everything meaningful?  What could give meaning to the pebble?</p>
<p>Here, you must invoke a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss2')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.

<p>The supposed meaningfulness of the pebble and the Cosmic Plan are mutually reinforcing.  The pebble couldn’t be meaningful without the Cosmic Plan.  If seemingly meaningless things were not <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss4')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.

When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> meaningful, the Cosmic Plan would have no work to do, and we would have no reason to imagine it.</p>
<p>Since usually things are meaningful only to someone, who likes or dislikes them, you might personalize the Cosmic Plan.  God is the “someone” to whom all things are meaningful, and whose preferences gives positive or negative value to all things.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_nihilism">Fear of excessive meaning motivates nihilism</h2>
<p>A gigantic spaceship arrives.  Astonishingly beautiful aliens emerge, and announce that they are on a diplomatic mission from the Universal Federation of a billion planets.</p>
<p>Humankind, they explain, has reached the point of sophistication where we can join the Federation.  We will not, however, join as junior partners.  Human beings have a unique spiritual ability not found anywhere else in the universe.  This ability is latent in us now, but can easily be developed with tools the aliens will provide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the entire universe, with its billions of inhabited planets, will be destroyed just a few years from now.  A tiny flaw in the fabric of reality is about to spread across the universe in an instant, like a pin-prick in a balloon, and the whole of space-time will evaporate.</p>
<p>Only the specially-developed spiritual abilities of human beings can prevent this.</p>
<p>The aliens will make us immortal and vastly more intelligent than any human has ever been—a necessary prerequisite to this spiritual development.  Naturally, this will make us radically different from the way we were; we will no longer be human.</p>
<p>Having saved the universe, humanity will lead all other intelligent species to a triumphant destiny, a culmination of the ultimate purpose of existence that is now utterly inconceivable.</p>
<p>However, since the aliens do not wish to force anyone to do anything, it is up to us to decide whether to undergo the transformation.</p>
<p>This is a meaningful choice.  The fate of the universe, and billions of billions of beings, hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Suddenly, your nagging back ache, your promotion review at work, and the credit card company’s screw-up that is causing all kinds of havoc—all highly meaningful yesterday—seem totally meaningless.  Political parties, religious differences, wars, economics, favorite songs—even these become meaningless by comparison.</p>
<p>The only way to say “this choice would not really be meaningful” is to insist that, no matter how many beings are affected, the apparent meaning is still just subjective.  It’s only in the minds of a bunch of random life-forms, who are (after all) just blobs of matter; swirls of subatomic particles.  Therefore, it is illusory.</p>
<p>Implicit here again is the view that <em>real</em> meaningfulness could only be objective, and could only be provided by something external to the universe.  There is no Cosmic Plan, so nothing is truly meaningful.</p>
<p>This is the stance of <dfn>nihilism</dfn>.  Nihilism’s improbable insistence on meaninglessness is also motivated by fear.  It is the mirror-image fear of eternalism.</p>
<p>The fear is that, if you admit <em>anything</em> is meaningful, then perhaps <em>everything</em> has a fixed meaning—or at least everything in your life.</p>
<p>You don’t want the responsibility of dealing with the intricacies, implications, and imperatives of all that meaningfulness. And if everything had a specific meaning, there would be no room for creativity.  You would have no freedom.</p>
<p>Perhaps worst of all, you might have to accept a lot of sentimental claptrap—the nonsense eternalists spout in a desperate attempt to justify their delusions.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_meaningness">Meaningness without a Cosmic Plan</h2>
<p>Eternalism and nihilism exist only out of fear of each other.  There is a better alternative—what I call the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss5')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest that meaningfulness is <em>not</em> provided by a Cosmic Plan.  There is no Cosmic Plan; but that does not mean that nothing is meaningful.</p>
<p>I suggest that some things are meaningful, and some things are not.  That is true even though we have no definite criteria to decide which is which.</p>
<p>I suggest that meaningness is <a href="#chap27_summary">neither objective, nor subjective</a>.</p>
<p>Accepting these suggestions allows you to let go of the unrealistic fears that motivate both eternalism and nihilism.</p>
<p>This complete view of meaningness has its own implications.  They may seem to make life more complicated.  However, the complete stance also eliminates <a href="#chap5">the many troubles eternalism and nihilism cause</a>.</p>

<p>I would love to tell you exactly what meaning is. I’d love to explain Life, The Universe, and Everything in a way that solves all your problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t—and neither can anyone else. That sucks; but <strong><em>this is the actual situation we are in</em></strong>.</p>
<p>We have a choice of explanations of meaningness: ones that are simple, clear, harmful, and wrong; or ones that are complex, vague, helpful, and approximately right. I prefer the latter.</p>
<p>It seems to me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>No one can say quite how meaning works.</li>

<p>This book will, eventually, say a lot about how meaningness works. Some of that will be intuitive and impressionistic. I hope understanding will accumulate as you read brief partial explanations, and examples in passing.</p>
<p>Some other discussions will be quite technical; perhaps most readers will want to skip over those. In any case, I am postponing most into the chapter on <a href="#chap92">monism and dualism</a>, which develops some necessary concepts.</p>
<p>But here’s a preview.</p>
<p id="extra29_summary">The natural human view is that meanings are inherent in external things. Thunder means the gods are angry, and that’s a fact about thunder and gods, not about people. So on this view, meanings are objective: external to us. They are the same for everyone.</p>
<p>When “same for everyone” ran into differences of opinion, monotheism moved all meanings into God instead. God gives everything <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss2')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimate</a> meanings, that no one may disagree with. God is external, so monotheistic meaning is also objective.</p>
<p>Then God died, and the world was disenchanted, so objects all became inherently meaningless dead matter. That meant meanings can’t be objective. The obvious alternative—developed in the 1700s—was that meanings are subjective. They live in the minds of individual people.</p>
<p>250 years later, versions of this idea are still taken for granted by most sophisticated people. Unfortunately, the subjective theory of meaning doesn’t work. It verges on <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>—outright denial of all meaning. Fortunately, the theory is also not true.</p>
<p>When you are hungry, the meaning of food is not subjective. You, personally, are hungry, but the meaning is shared with everyone else (and probably all other vertebrate animals). It’s not particularly “mental”; it’s as much in your sensory organs, and digestive system, as in your brain. And it’s in the actions of your hands and mouth as you eat.</p>
<p>The meaning of a handshake is partly arbitrary, but it is not subjective. You can’t redefine it to make it mean what you want. When you shake hands, the meaning depends on a huge amount of cultural background, involving millions of people. It probably also depends on evolved biological functions we don’t know much about.</p>
<p>The subjective theory of meaning is not full-blown nihilism, but tends to slide into it. That’s because we actually <em>can’t</em> mean anything much by ourselves; meaning is mostly a social and cultural activity. Narrowing one’s focus to supposedly personal meanings leads to social and cultural alienation, and then to <a href="#chap87">nihilistic depression</a>.</p>
<p>A meaning is neither subjective nor objective; it is not inside your mind, nor outside. It requires both subjects and objects, and it doesn’t dwell in either. It takes time and space, but it is not precisely located.</p>
<p>Especially, a meaning does not live in your brain. That popular pseudoscientific idea is the “representational theory of mind.” It is <a href="#chap106">internally contradictory and unworkable</a>. Meaning may require a brain, but usually many brains, and also non-brain stuff.</p>
<p>Meaningness is a dynamic, interactive process. Any particular meaning involves a complicated history of many creatures and things; a network of involvement that we only ever partly understand.</p>
<p>A meaning always <em>appears</em> nebulous to us, because we never know everything about it. This is, in philosophical terms, a epistemological fact: about us. I believe that meanings are also <em>actually</em> nebulous. That is an ontological theory, about meaningness. I’ll discuss this technically, later in the book. However, epistemological nebulosity is enough for practical purposes.</p>
<p>We have to live <em>as if</em> meaningness is nebulous, whether it ultimately is or not. This book is about how.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_harmful">Eternalism is wrong and harmful, yet appealing</h2>
<p>It’s obvious that <a href="#chap25">many things are meaningless</a>, and most meanings are <a href="#chap24">somewhat vague</a>. In other words, we all know that eternalism is wrong. We’re only tempted to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'adopt', 'gloss5')" title="“Adopting” a stance means using its pattern of feeling and thinking to address the dimension of meaningness it relates to.  Often one adopts a stance only momentarily, and typically without noticing it. [Click for details.]">adopt</a> eternalism at times when meaninglessness or ambiguity is emotionally threatening. (See “<a href="#chap26">Extreme examples</a>” for a preview.)</p>
<p>Since it’s <em>obviously</em> wrong, I won’t argue against eternalism in detail. That would not be particularly helpful. We always already know it’s mistaken, and yet we fall into it anyway. (If you are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'committed', 'gloss6')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up. [Click for details.]">committed</a> to an eternalist system, I send good wishes, and suggest that you won’t find this book to your taste.)</p>
<p>Even if you specifically reject eternalism, you will find that you adopt it at times, unwittingly. (Or I do, anyway!) This is particularly true for those who <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'waver', 'gloss7')" title="When you have committed to a stance, but have not accomplished it, then you are “wavering.”  Wavering means that you are trying to adopt a stance consistently, but are finding it difficult or impossible to do so. [Click for details.]">waver</a> in their relationship with eternalism. That includes agnostics, spiritual seekers, and miscellaneous “other”s who remain uncommitted to any stance.</p>
<p>Understanding why we are vulnerable to eternalism is the first step toward avoiding it. These emotional dynamics are independent of specific beliefs or commitments. I’ll start with <a href="#chap30">a funny story</a> about a time I got suckered by eternalism. Then I’ll explain more generally  <a href="#chap31">its emotional appeal</a>.</p>
<p>Then I’ll point out ways it fails to deliver on its emotional promises, and <a href="#chap37">causes harm and suffering</a>. This can be hard to accept, because eternalism seems to offer hope, solace, purpose, ethical certainty, and all manner of other desirable meaning-goods. It promises <a href="#chap34">control</a> over your life—but cannot deliver. Seeing through this deceptive game lets you escape playing it.</p>
<p>Eternalism depends on a series of <a href="#chap38">ploys</a> to make it seem plausible. These are tricks we play on ourselves, and each other, to avoid seeing eternalism’s failures. I will explain how to recognize and disarm each of these tactics.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_religion">This is (mostly) not about religion</h2>
<p>Religions—especially fundamentalist ones—are the most obvious forms of eternalism. However, eternalism is <a href="#chap7">more basic</a> than religion, or any other system. It’s not about specific beliefs; it is a fundamental attitude to meaningness. It can show up <a href="#chap30">unaccompanied by any conceptual system</a>. It can show up in non-ideological popular attitudes to meaning—for example, in idealized conceptions of romance, illustrated at the top of this page.</p>
<p>So, although parts of my discussion of eternalism may sound similar to familiar criticisms of religion, it applies to atheists, skeptics, and rationalists too. We are not immune. Dropping religious beliefs is <a href="#chap60">only a first step</a> towards freeing ourselves from eternalism.</p>
<p>Political ideologies—especially extremist ones—insist on fixed meanings. So do various other systems, including some brands of rationalism, psychotherapy, scientism, and so on. The final part of this chapter discusses these <a href="#chap59">non-theistic forms of eternalism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_howidiscoveredtheultimatemeaningofbeing">How I discovered The Ultimate Meaning Of Being</h2>
<p>The point of gambling was lost on me.</p>
<p>I am not especially risk-averse. As a businessman, I often made decisions in which millions of dollars, and the survival of the enterprise, were at stake. Nowadays, I pursue outdoor sports in which death is a definite possibility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do not enjoy risk for its own sake. I see no point in taking risks unless the expected rewards are greater.</p>
<p>The puzzling thing about casino gambling is that it has <a href="http://www.pokertips.org/strategy/expected-value.php">“negative expected value.”↗︎︎</a> Over time, gamblers almost always lose more money than they make. In fact, the modern conceptual framework for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">“rational action”↗︎︎</a> was invented to explain why gambling is a bad idea. So what’s the point?</p>
<p>A decade ago, I started passing through Reno airport regularly, and sometimes spent the night in hotels there. They all have enormous casinos on the ground floor, laid out so that you cannot avoid walking past innumerable flashing, blooping slot machines on the way to your room.</p>
<p>Being curious about human motivations, I used to watch the gamblers, trying to figure out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_conceit">what they were feeling↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>I had some guesses; but I thought I ought to try betting, to see if I could experience the same thing. My guess was that I couldn’t. It seemed likely that gamblers gambled because they were stupid, or did not understand negative expectation value, or had some sort of superstitious belief that they were <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'special', 'gloss1')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.  This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">special</a>, so randomness did not apply. I couldn’t adopt their wrong beliefs, so I wouldn’t be able to have the experience they did.</p>
<p>I had also heard it said that you can only understand gambling by wagering a sum large enough that losing it would be a serious problem for you. I wanted to understand, but not that badly.</p>
<p>Applying rational decision theory, I resolved to obtain as much information as I could at the least possible expected cost. (That strategy is automatic for me.) I looked for the lowest-stakes slot machine, and found one that would let me bet a single cent on each round.</p>
<p>So I fed it a dollar—the least it would accept—and pulled the handle. I immediately won five cents. And ten cents on the next try! Then several losses in a row. </p>
<p>I upped my bet from one to five cents—and won again.</p>
<p>As I consistently won more than I lost, I was gradually suffused with a warm glow. I felt safe and at home in the world. What a blessed relief!</p>
<p>I realized that <em>the universe loved me</em>, and that everything was going to come out well after all. My ever-present nagging sense of vague <em>wrongness</em> disappeared, and I recognized that it had always been a misunderstanding. Everything is as it should be; everything is connected; everything <em>makes sense</em>; everything is benevolently watched over by the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss2')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>. </p>
<p>This was <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalism</a> <em>straight-up</em>, purely at a bodily, felt level.</p>
<p>I’m disposed to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss4')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>; so, at the same time, I was running a sardonic mental commentary. The cognitive dissonance between <em>feeling</em> unquestioned confidence in the All-Good <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss5')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>, and my <em>intellectual</em> confidence that casino operators ensure that their slot machines are a losing bet, was extremely funny. That humorousness fed back into my bodily enjoyment.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to conclude that I had gained all the knowledge I had asked for, and far more. The universe, in its infinite generosity, had gifted me with profound insight. To finish the charade, I increased my bet to 25 cents, and then 50 cents.</p>
<p>I walked back toward my hotel room grinning like the village idiot, unspeakably happy. </p>
<p>As I entered the elevator, a sexy lady jumped in with me.</p>
<p>“Lucky night?” she asked.</p>
<p>(It dawned on me only as I was writing this that she was a professional. I’m kind of clueless about such things. A guy in a suit, leaving a casino floor accompanied only by a gigantic grin, is surely a fine business opportunity.)</p>
<p>“No!” I exclaimed, beaming. “At one point I was up by thirty-seven cents, but in the end I lost the whole dollar!”</p>
<p>Her face closed; she turned away, and wouldn’t look at me for the rest of the elevator ride.</p>
<p>There’s something <em>wrong</em> with anyone who’s that excited about thirty-seven cents.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismisanaddiction">Eternalism is an addiction</h2>
<p>Actually, winning thirty-seven cents was not going to make a <em>such</em> a big difference in my life.</p>
<p>Discovering universal love would. That was a <em>really great</em> feeling. Experiencing that all the time—the way some mystics supposedly do—would be fabulous.</p>
<p>That sense of <a href="#chap34">safety</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap32">certainty</a> could be addictive. I think that’s part of why we all frequently fall into the eternalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss6')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a>—even when we know better. </p>
<p>Eternalism <em>feels right</em>—absolutely right. And when we lose it, we’ll do almost anything to get it back. We’ll <a href="#chap46">pretend not to see obvious randomness</a>, and take up arms to <a href="#chap47">destroy evidence of it</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismandpatternicity">Eternalism and patternicity</h2>
<p>“<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns">Patternicity↗︎︎</a>”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_91el3se" id="extra29_footnoteref1_91el3se" title="More formally, patternicity is called “apophenia.”">1</a> is the brain’s built-in tendency to perceive <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterns', 'gloss7')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterns</a> that don’t exist. An example is the experience of seeing a face in the light and dark patches on a rock, or splotch of paint, or piece of toast. It’s often impossible to <em>not-see</em> them, even when you are undeceived, and know perfectly well there’s no face there.</p>
<p>Eternalism is patternicity for broad dimensions of meaning—purpose, value, ethics—rather than physical objects. Our brains seem to have evolved to find patterns of meaning, too. In the casino, the intellectual understanding that my feelings were ridiculous did not make them any less profound. Runs of unexpected good or bad luck trigger the eternalist stance automatically.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_subjective">Meaningness is not merely subjective</h2>
<p>Some claim that meanings are merely subjective: matters of personal opinion, or at most cultural conventions. Unfortunately, this slides rapidly into nihilism. Fortunately, meanings are not merely subjective. I will explain both this in detail later in the book, but:</p>
<p>If meaningness was merely subjective, it would not be possible to be wrong about it. However, my felt beliefs about meaning, in the grip of a run of good luck, were definitely outright wrong.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismanddopamine">Eternalism and dopamine</h2>
<p>The joy of winning, patternicity, addiction, mania, and religion are all connected by the neurotransmitter dopamine.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_wyehu6d" id="extra29_footnoteref2_wyehu6d" title="This is according to current neuroscience, which is always subject to revision. I think the connection between gambling, patternicity, addiction, mania, and eternalism holds regardless of the mechanism.">2</a> Dopamine plays a key role in motivation and reward. It spikes in response to <em>unexpected success</em>, and is experienced as pleasurable and energizing.</p>
<p>Dopamine reinforces your discovery of a valuable connection, with a new practical understanding of the world. It’s your brain telling you you finally got things right, for once—so pay attention, remember this, and do it again!</p>
<p>Random gambling wins are unexpected, and therefore cause dopamine release. Unfortunately, that increases patternicity, because the brain treats dopamine as evidence of insight. Gamblers typically believe in “luck” as something that comes and goes, and “streaks” of wins or losses that they can detect. When “on a winning streak,” they expect it to continue; but they also believe a losing streak must be balanced by future winnings. Either way, perceptions of non-existent patterns keep them playing.</p>
<p>Stimulant drugs, such as nicotine, cocaine, and speed, raise dopamine levels, mimicking the reward effect of unexpected success. Stimulant addiction and gambling addiction are, therefore, believed to work in much the same way.</p>
<p>Mania—the “up” phase of manic depression—is similar to an cocaine high, and may also be dopamine-mediated.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_2mnumi2" id="extra29_footnoteref3_2mnumi2" title="The science of this isn’t yet clear, as of 2013. Other neurotransmitters are also involved.">3</a><sup>,</sup><a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_j2x4f4l" id="extra29_footnoteref4_j2x4f4l" title="Depression is closely connected with nihilism, just as hypomania is connected with eternalism. Depressives experience below-average patternicity, and diminished pleasure and motivation from unexpected successes.">4</a> </p>
<p>Hyper-religiosity is common in mania. The manic feels full of cosmic realization, spiritual vision, confidence, and charisma. Many religious leaders probably experience stable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania#Possible_benefits">hypomania↗︎︎</a>—the only mildly-delusional form that doesn’t interfere much with life.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismstraight-up">Eternalism straight-up</h2>
<p>Eternalism is most obvious in <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systems', 'gloss8')" title="“Systems,” in this book, are conceptual, methodological, and institutional structures that make claims about meaningness.  These include, for instance, religions, philosophies, political ideologies, and psychological frameworks. A system includes a structure of justification, which explains why you should believe its claims, and typically grounds in an eternal ordering principle. I contrast systems with stances, which are much simpler attitudes toward meaningness. [Click for details.]">systems</a> that reinforce it with concepts. For example, Christianity reinforces eternalism with beliefs about God, who makes everything meaningful.</p>
<p>My slot-machine experience was eternalism <em>straight-up</em>, with no conceptual framework. God was not in the picture, because I’m a life-long atheist, and thirty-seven cents was not enough to change my mind about Him. Probably if I <em>had</em> believed in God, my mental commentary would have been about my relationship with Him, though.</p>
<p>Instead, I had just a vague feeling about my relationship with the Non-Me. When I say I felt that “the universe loves me,” this did not involve any concept of “the universe” as a thing; rather, a vague omnidirectional feeling of being loved.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismandsystems">Eternalism and systems</h2>
<p>It’s easy to see how experiences similar to mine in the casino (but more intense or frequent) can grow into eternalist systems. Put a name on the feeling, make up some theories about it, and you’ve founded a religion, self-help movement, or alternative therapy. Your vague certainty that <em>everything now makes sense</em> justifies your metaphysical speculations.</p>
<p>Established eternalist systems can also co-opt such experiences, and use them to reinforce their conceptual dogmas. Whenever someone feels something like I did, the system’s representative can say “Yes! You got it! That was God’s love / psychological integration / enlightenment / healing energy / <em>etc.</em>” </p>
<p>And when, inevitably, it dissipates, he or she will tell you what you need to do to get it back. Eternalist systems relentlessly exploit this addictive dynamic.</p>
<p>Critics of eternalist systems usually attack their beliefs. False beliefs are mostly not what make eternalism compelling, though—it’s the emotional dynamics. Addiction is only one of those. </p>
<p>To free yourself, or others, from eternalism, addressing the emotional dynamics is even more important than refuting concepts.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalismmakesyoumiserable">Eternalism makes you miserable</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t experience <em>unexpected</em> success very often; we’d come to expect it. Trying to prolong the dopamine high usually makes you miserable instead.</p>
<p>Gamblers almost all lose money in the long run. Coming off of cocaine is depressing. Then it takes bigger and bigger doses to get you equally high, with increasingly nasty side-effects. Mania ends in crippling depression.</p>
<p>Eternalism also always lets you down. It seems to offer hope and solace, but in the end it always runs into the brick wall of reality. Then, when it’s impossible to ignore <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss9')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<p>Even <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss4')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

Sometimes raw eternalism can provide certainty without specifics—as in <a href="#chap30">my casino experience</a>. Usually, though, we need a web of justifications, of canned answers, to not-see nebulosity. That’s what ideologies—religions, political theories, <a href="#chap59">secular cults</a>—provide. These justifications frequently fail, when nebulosity contradicts them.</p>
<p>When the fantasy of absolute answers is threatened by evidence, eternalism responds with various <a href="#chap38">psychological ploys</a>. These include, for instance, <a href="#chap49">suppressing dissenting thoughts</a>, <a href="#chap45">physically removing yourself</a> from contradictory situations, <a href="#chap46">kitschy sentimentality</a>, <a href="#chap48">blind faith</a>, <a href="#chap53">mystification</a>, and <a href="#chap47">arming yourself against perception</a>.</p>
<p>Eternalism is at its most glorious in a conversion experience, during the honeymoon after you have first <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'committed', 'gloss8')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up.

<p>Alternatively, seeking renewed certainty, you may search for a new system. Some people become serial conversion junkies. But as with opiate addiction, it becomes harder and harder to recreate the first high. And the periods of doubt between commitments, like heroin withdrawal, turn increasingly into nihilistic <a href="#chap88">anxiety</a> and <a href="#chap87">despair</a>. This pattern was particularly common in the California Bay Area in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. It afflicted many of my friends, and that was my initial motivation to write this book. Since I started writing, more than a decade ago, <a href="#chap173">new patterns have emerged</a>—but they are no less dysfunctional.</p>
<p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century West, there are hundreds of competing eternalist systems. Although they all have the same fundamental <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss5')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness.

This adds to the chaos and confusion that eternalism tries to dispel. Further, there is widespread understanding that <em>none</em> of the systems can provide certainty.

If you have an explanation for why something means something, it increases your certainty that it does mean that. If you understand something, you feel that you can control it.

<h2 id="extra29_causality">Illusions of understanding: everyday causality</h2>
<p>Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil, in <a href="http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/RozKeil02.pdf">an influential 2002 paper↗︎︎</a>, showed that people believe they understand familiar manufactured objects (such as can openers) and natural phenomena (such as tides) much better than they actually do. The researchers had subjects rate their understanding of various objects and phenomena, and then asked them to give an explanation. After that, the subjects rated their own understanding again. Their second ratings were <em>much</em> lower. Most subjects were surprised to find, after trying and failing to explain, that they understood much less than they had thought.</p>
<p>You might like to try this before reading on. On a scale of 1 to 7, how well do you think you understand a can opener? 1 would mean you know what it is for, but have basically no idea how it works. 7 means you know everything that anyone would know, short of being a can opener designer.</p>
<p>Now, explain how a can opener works. You could write this out in words, or draw a can opener from memory.  Label the parts with what they do. (No fair looking at the picture at the head of this page! And for a fair trial, you need to do this on paper or screen; as we’ll see, it’s almost impossible not to cheat if you do it in your head.)</p>
<p>When you are done: has your estimate of your depth of understanding changed?</p>
<p>Now  go look at an actual can opener, and at least put it up against a can as if you were about to open it. Turn the handle and watch how the mechanism moves. Then re-rate your written understanding. And how well do you think you understand now, after examining the reality?</p>
<p>I did this after reading the Rozenblit paper, and was surprised to find that my explanation had some details wrong, and significant missing parts. I also discovered, after playing with two ordinary manual crank-turning can openers, that they worked on completely different principles. I’ve used both types a million times, and never noticed this, because you <em>use</em> them exactly the same way. My rating of my original understanding went from 6 to 3. I’m estimating my new understanding at 6, but I’m worried I’m still overconfident!</p>
<p>It turns out that for most everyday objects, we have some vague mental image, but not an actual causal understanding. Here’s the Rozenblit paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people feel they understand the world with far greater detail, coherence, and depth than they really do. … [They] wrongly attribute far too much fidelity and detail to their mental representations because the sparse renderings do have some efficacy and do provide a rush of insight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(“A rush of insight”… Remind you of something? A spectre haunting Europe, perhaps?)</p>
<p>We think we understand a can opener because we can play a mental movie of using one. That <em>feels</em> as though it is almost as good as actually watching. But:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mental movie is much more like Hollywood than it is like real life—it fails to respect reality constraints. When we try to lean on the seductively glossy surface we find the façades of our mental films are hollow card-board. That discovery, the revelation of the shallowness of our mental representations for perceptually salient processes, may be what causes the surprise in our participants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you are a kitchen tool engineer, there’s no reason to actually understand how a can opener works. What everyone else needs is to know (1) what it is for and (2) how to use it. So most of the time “understanding” is really “comfort with.” It means you know how to interact with it well enough to get by, and you are reassured that it is not going to explode without warning. This comfort is provided mainly by familiarity, not understanding. Having used a can opener many times convinces you that you understand it, because you can almost always make one work, and you almost never cut yourself. Tellingly, Rozenblit and Keil found that their subjects did <em>not</em> overestimate their “how-to” knowledge, only their “how-it-works” knowledge.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_z82a5ct" id="extra29_footnoteref4_z82a5ct" title="This result is actually a bit surprising, because the psychological literature generally finds that most people are overconfident about most things. Rozenblit and Keil did find overconfidence effects for some other types of knowledge, such as geography, but overconfidence about causality was much larger.">4</a></p>
<p>Learning how things work is usually a waste of time, from an evolutionary perspective. And total understanding is never even possible. The “illusion of explanatory depth” may have evolved to tell us when to stop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have to learn to use much sparser representations of causal relations that are good enough to give us the necessary insights: insights that go beyond associative similarity but which at the same time are not overwhelming in terms of cognitive load. It may therefore be quite adaptive to have the illusion that we know more than we do so that we settle for what is enough. The illusion might be an essential governor on our drive to search for explanatory underpinnings; it terminates potentially inexhaustible searches for ever-deeper understanding by satiating the drive for more knowledge once some skeletal level of causal comprehension is reached.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t always work right; our brains’ guesses about when to stop can go wrong. Education theorists find that students often stop trying to understand too soon, when they <a href="http://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/winter-2003-2004/ask-cognitive-scientist">merely feel “familiar” with the material↗︎︎</a>, because the modern classroom demands a depth of understanding beyond what would have been useful to our ancestors. Conversely, my interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalocaridid">Precambrian evolution↗︎︎</a> is probably a pathological result of mild autism—a brain abnormality.</p>
<p>If you look closely at a can opener in operation, you can see immediately how it works. Then you forget as soon as you look away. Knowing that you <em>could</em> figure out how something works, whenever you need to, is a good reason not to bother until then—and not to remember afterward. Rozenblit and Keil hypothesized that our brains confuse vague visual memory with understanding, and that this was the source of the illusion they found.</p>
<p id="extra29_bicycles">This was confirmed in Rebecca Lawson’s study of people’s <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~rlawson/PDF_Files/L-M%26C-2006.pdf">understanding of bicycles↗︎︎</a>. She found that most people have no clue what a bicycle looks like, much less how one works, even if they own one. (I know that sounds implausible; the results in the paper are dramatic.) We all have a <em>memory of seeing</em> a bicycle, and on that basis think we know what one looks like—but few people can draw something that’s even approximately similar. The bicycle-like things they do draw could not possibly work.</p>
<p>You might like to try this before reading on. Don’t bother being artistic; the picture can just show how the main parts (handlebars, frame, seat, pedals, chain, wheels) attach to each other.</p>
<p>Lawson found that people <em>can</em> easily understand how a bicycle works, and draw one accurately, if there’s one in front of them. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We may be using the world as an “outside memory” to save us from having to store huge amounts of information. Since much of the information that we need in everyday life can be found simply by moving our eyes, we do not need to store it and then retrieve it from memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This point will be important, by the way, in my explanations for how meaning works, much later in this book.)</p>
<p>Here’s a bicycle drawn by someone who rides one most days:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bicycle drawing" height="171" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bogus_bicycle_208x171.png" width="208"/>
</figure>
<p>This “bicycle” couldn’t turn, because the front wheel is connected to frame struts that form two sides of a rigid quadrilateral. Mistakenly, it has the chain going around the front wheel as well as the back one, which also would make turning impossible (among other problems, with gearing for instance).</p>
<p>Perceptual understanding isn’t possible for all devices—for example if they have hidden parts, or are very complicated, or run on invisible forces such as electricity.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_6ch3x3m" id="extra29_footnoteref5_6ch3x3m" title="Rozenblit and Keil found preliminary evidence that subjects were less likely to overestimate their understanding in these cases. I don’t know whether this has been confirmed by subsequent studies.">5</a></p>
<p>So what about meaning, which is also invisible?</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ethics">Illusions of understanding: ethics</h2>
<p>Most people think they understand ethics reasonably well. However, their ethical explanations often don’t make sense; they depend on weird assumptions, use dream logic, or skip over major issues. My story “<a href="#chap24">The puzzle of meaningness</a>” includes some humorous examples. Our feeling of understanding ethics is largely illusory; we don’t notice that our own ethical explanations are incoherent.</p>
<p>The following question is a classic of moral psychology research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman’s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I’m going to make money from it.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_n37mzmp" id="extra29_footnoteref6_n37mzmp" title="If you know the least bit about drug development, this story will seem absurdly unrealistic. That annoys me. Maybe this absurdity is not relevant to the essential ethical dilemma, which you are supposed to somehow abstract from the details. However, I worry that unrealistic scenarios—the famous “trolley problems” are another example—give misleading results. In fact, I suspect artificial “thought experiments,” even if they weren’t obviously silly, may be worse than useless for understanding ethics. I’ll suggest later that observation of real-life ethical deliberation and action in “ecologically valid conditions” is needed instead.">6</a> So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man’s laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might like to write out your own brief explanation before reading on.</p>
<p>This exercise may seem risky or embarrassing. A feeling of moral competence is often close to the heart of one’s sense of self. However, most experts say there is no right or wrong answer, although there are interestingly different <em>kinds</em> of answers.</p>
<p>It might also help to know that even professional theologians and moral philosophers are often unable to give coherent ethical explanations. Despite fancy footwork, theological answers boil down to “because that’s what God wants,” with no clear reason He wants that. Secular academic theories of ethics are <a href="#chap129">all known to be wrong</a>. Moral philosophers must support some theory, arguing “this is less bad than the others,” but most admit that their professional expertise is rarely useful when dealing with everyday ethical problems. Evidently, professional ethicists are afflicted with a powerful illusion of explanatory depth.</p>
<p>Why do people think they mostly understand ethics, if they can’t explain it coherently? As with can openers, we know what it is <em>for</em>, and we know <em>how to use it</em> well enough to get by. The feeling of understanding is an illusion based on familiarity and comfort. We know through experience that we can navigate ethical issues reasonably reliably, and they are not going to suddenly explode. As with devices, this is adequate for most people most of the time.</p>
<p>Ethics sometimes <em>does</em> explode on you—for example, if you are caught having an affair. It’s not just that there will be bad consequences; there will be many difficult choices and judgements in sorting out the mess, and the inadequacy of your ethical understanding may become obvious. Sometimes such crises lead to psychological growth, including developing a more sophisticated ethical understanding.</p>
<p>Research in moral psychology has found that people’s ethical understanding passes through a predictable series of stages. The stages are defined not in terms of what people consider right or wrong, but what sorts of explanations they use to justify those judgements. The Heinz story was invented by Lawrence Kohlberg as a way of eliciting such explanations. He assigned them to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development">six stages of moral development↗︎︎</a>. There are some problems with Kohlberg’s theory—mainly, it is too rationalistic—but the conclusion that people advance from lesser to greater ethical understanding seems correct, and important.</p>
<p>Disquietingly, research has found that most adults get stuck somewhere in the middle of the developmental sequence. The <dfn>illusion of ethical understanding</dfn> is one reason they may not progress. As with bicycles, if you think you know how ethics works, and can use it well enough most of the time, there seems no reason to try to understand better.</p>
<p>Robert Kegan has <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">extended and improved↗︎︎</a> Kohlberg’s framework. He describes an ethical equivalent to Rozenblit and Keil’s discovery that attempting to explain things can reveal one’s own lack of understanding. The illusion of understanding sometimes dissolves when you have to give an ethical explanation.</p>
<p>Realizing your explanations are inadequate opens the possibility of a forward ethical stage transition. This happens only rarely, however. One reason is that it is easy to recognize that your understanding of a bicycle is wrong, by visually comparing your drawing with a real one. It is much harder to reality-test moral understanding, because ethics are far more <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss4')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a> than bicycles.</p>
<p>Eternalism, by promoting a reassuring illusion of ethical understanding, hinders moral development. This is most obvious in religious fundamentalism, which denies the nebulosity of ethics, stranding you in a childish moral understanding. <a href="#chap63">Rationalist eternalism</a> typically <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixates', 'gloss5')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.

These are adolescent rather than childish; utilitarianism is a common example.</p>
<p>Fortunately, eternalist ethical systems have <a href="#chap153">become less credible</a>, so it’s easier to advance to more sophisticated understandings. Unfortunately, “easier” is not “easy,” and ethical anxiety—a sense of being lost at sea when it comes to ethics—is increasingly prevalent. That is a major topic of the upcoming <a href="#chap127">chapter on ethics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_politics">Illusions of understanding: politics</h2>
<p>Contemporary “politics” is mostly about polarized moral opinions.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_nxcflx1" id="extra29_footnoteref7_nxcflx1" title="I’ll analyze this important, unfortunate development repeatedly, at various points later in the book.">7</a> It is now considered normal, or even obligatory, for people to express vehement political opinions about issues they know nothing about, and which do not affect their life in any way. This is harmful and stupid.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/political_extremism.pdf">Political Extremism Is Supported by an Illusion of Understanding↗︎︎</a>” (Fernbach <i>et al.</i>, 2013) applies the Rozenblit method to political explanations. After subjects tried to explain how proposed political programs they supported would actually work, their confidence in them dropped. Subjects realized that their explanations were inadequate, and that they didn’t really understand the programs. This decreased their <a href="#chap32">certainty</a> that they would work. The subjects expressed more moderate opinions, and became less willing to make political donations in support of the programs, after discovering that they didn’t understand them as well as they had thought.</p>
<p>Fernbach <i>et al.</i> found that subjects’ opinions did <em>not</em> moderate when they were asked to explain <em>why</em> they supported their favored political programs. Other experiments have found this usually increases the extremeness of opinions, instead. Generating an explanation for why you support a program, rather than of how it would work, leads to retrieving or inventing justifications, which makes you more certain, not less. These political justifications usually rely on abstract values, appeals to authority, and general principles that require little specific knowledge of the issue. They are impossible to reality-test, and therefore easy to fool yourself with.</p>
<p>Extreme, ignorant political opinions are <a href="#chap75">largely driven by eternalism</a>. I find the Fernbach paper heartening, in showing that people can be shaken out of them. <em>Arguing</em> about politics almost never changes anyone’s mind; <em>explaining</em>, apparently, does.</p>
<p>This suggests a practice: when someone is ranting about a political proposal you disagree with, keep asking them “how would that part work?” Rather than raising objections, see if you can draw them into developing an ever-more-detailed causal explanation.

<p>Eternalism promises to make <em>everything</em> make sense. It sometimes does deliver an illusion of universal understanding (as in the account of conversion to communism, above). Usually it can’t quite manage that, because almost all eternalism is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'wavering', 'gloss7')" title="When you have committed to a stance, but have not accomplished it, then you are “wavering.”  Wavering means that you are trying to adopt a stance consistently, but are finding it difficult or impossible to do so. [Click for details.]">wavering</a>. The curtain that is supposed to conceal the illusionist is translucent. Most people realize they don’t understand everything. Still, eternalism does trick most people into believing they understand many things they don’t.</p>
<p>Somehow, we don’t notice that our explanations don’t make sense. How does eternalism manage that? I don’t have a complete answer, but I do have pieces of an answer. In fact, there is no one answer; eternalism has a big bag of tricks. The main part of this chapter describes a series of <dfn><a href="#chap38">eternalist ploys</a></dfn>: ways of thinking, feeling, talking, and acting that <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stabilize', 'gloss8')" title="Stances toward meaningness are inherently unstable, because they fail to fit reality or are emotionally unattractive.

<p>The rest of this page discusses some other mechanisms that don’t fit into this “eternalist ploy” category.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_visualizing">Visualizing meaningness</h3>
<p>Research like Lawson’s bicycle experiment shows that genuine understanding usually depends on perceptual support. It comes from exploring concrete examples by looking and poking. To some extent we can transfer that understanding by mental visualization; but as Rozenblit found, this is sketchy.</p>
<p>Direct perceptual support is generally impossible for meaningness (ethics, purpose, and so on). However, we do use mental images to help understand these issues too. Thinking about the Heinz story, I generated an image of his children watching their mother dying, for example. Likewise, when thinking about life purpose, we fantasize scenes of accomplishment, or imagine dying without having gotten anything much done.</p>
<p>These images are emotive, but probably mostly unrealistic and unhelpful. (The Heinz story didn’t even <em>mention</em> children, for example; maybe he didn’t have any!) I suspect eternalism leads us to take these mental movies much more seriously than they deserve. (How? I’m not sure.)</p>
<h3 id="extra29_mystical">Mystical experiences of total understanding</h3>
<p>People in non-ordinary states, produced by psychedelic drugs or meditation, often proclaim sudden, unshakable, universal understanding. They rarely or never can explain their supposed understanding. I think these are probably mostly illusory. Such experiences <em>may</em> give <a href="https://vividness.live/2012/09/13/epistemology-and-enlightenment/#non-ordinaryexperiencesandinsight">genuine but ineffable insight↗︎︎</a> into <em>some</em> things. I’m reasonably sure they involve <a href="https://vividness.live/2012/09/13/epistemology-and-enlightenment/#turpentine">no actual understanding↗︎︎</a> of most things. </p>
<p>Eternalist systems are often led by people who have such visions; but most of their adherents don’t. <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Ordinary', 'gloss11')" title="Ordinariness is the  confused stance that no one is better than anyone else, and that one’s value derives from herd membership. [Click for details.]">Ordinary</a> eternalists have to rely on the cosmic understanding of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'special', 'gloss12')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.  This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">special</a> people.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_social">Socially distributed (mis)understanding of meaning</h3>
<p>Understanding of the physical world is socially distributed. You don’t need to understand how to build a bicycle frame, because there are people whose job that is, and you can rely on their understanding.</p>
<p>The same division of labor applies to understanding meaning.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_21dmyzi" id="extra29_footnoteref8_21dmyzi" title="This will be central in my eventual explanation for how meaningness works. Interestingly (to me), my PhD thesis—titled Vision, Instruction, and Action—is also about perceptual understanding during improvised activity, and socially distributed understanding (communicated through over-the-shoulder instructions) of that activity.">8</a> For instance, if you are Catholic, you know (or should know) that masturbation is a grave sin.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_2r71q9e" id="extra29_footnoteref9_2r71q9e" title="See Catechism 2396 if you are in doubt.">9</a> Why? </p>
<p>You may remember the story of Onan, who spilled his seed on the ground. You may also remember that the story is not about masturbation, but <i>coitus interruptus</i>. (That’s confusing.) You may recall that masturbation is a sin against chastity, and that the only proper use of the genitals is procreation. Or maybe also conjugal love. Why?</p>
<p>This is a pesky, impertinent question. You are (or should be) quite certain that you are correct, even if you can’t give a coherent explanation.</p>
<p>You don’t <em>need</em> to be able to give an explanation, because you know that if you go to a Jesuit, he will (or should)<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_woqo2ba" id="extra29_footnoteref10_woqo2ba" title="Disastrously, some priests have gotten wobbly on masturbation, and are leading millions into damnation.">10</a> be able to explain in detail, with extensive logic, and answers to all objections. Your certainty can rest on your knowledge that an explanation is available, without having to know the details.</p>
<p>Although... for nearly everyone, it’s obvious that whatever explanation a priest gives for the evil of masturbation, it will be nonsense. It will be verbiage that <em>sounds like</em> explanation, but isn’t. Only loyalty to the eternalist system—the <a href="#chap48">will to believe</a>—could fool anyone into thinking it’s meaningful.</p>
<p id="extra29_opinions">The same is true for most political opinions. Individuals are usually incapable of producing coherent explanations; but why should they?</p>
<p>You have heard experts on TV explaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack">Benghazi↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL_controversies">Keystone↗︎︎</a>, and they seemed to make sense; and you know they are good and trustworthy and smart people, because they share your fundamental values. You might not be able to explain those issues in detail, but you are confident that <em>they</em> can. But perhaps those explanations are about as accurate as the priest’s?</p>
<h3 id="extra29_agreeing">Agreeing to agree about meanings</h3>
<p>Because eternalist delusion is so desirable, people <a href="#chap44">collude to maintain it</a>. We all agree to agree—vociferously—to whatever meanings our social group comes up with. That is a genuinely compassionate activity. We all want to save each other from <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss13')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.</p>
<p id="extra29_regurgitate">Agreeing violently about political opinions is a major social activity. Groups of friends get together and regurgitate political explanations they’ve heard on TV or read on the web. This reinforces certainty and the illusion of understanding.</p>
<p>Talent for regurgitation gives you social prestige; people think it’s an important life skill. Imagine—if you got good enough at it, you could go on TV and vomit opinions in front of millions of people! Mostly, though, this is a collaborative, improvisatory, small-group activity.</p>
<p>Similarly, ethical explanation is mainly a social activity. Moral philosophers want ethics to be about rational individual decision-making, but it mostly isn’t. (This is one reason academic ethics is so useless.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~wcarbona/Haidt%202001.pdf">Research↗︎︎</a> by Jonathan Haidt and others shows that ethical explanations are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism">mostly used to justify↗︎︎</a> actions we have taken or want to take. This “social intuitionism” is a descriptive theory, about how ethics works in practice. It’s not a good account (even according to Haidt) of how ethics <em>ought</em> to work.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#chap127">ethics chapter</a>, I’ll ask “what is ethics for?” if not social justification, and not rational individual decision-making. I’ll argue that genuine understanding is genuinely valuable.</p>
<ul class="footnotes"><li class="footnote" id="extra29_footnote1_mpwutwp"><a class="footnote-label" href="#extra29_footnoteref1_mpwutwp">1.</a> Nevertheless, certainty, understanding, and control all seem to be separate innate psychological drives.

<p>“Nebulosity”—cloud-like-ness—is the impossibility of completely grasping anything. If we could just get a handle on things, we could force them to behave. But, to varying degrees, we never can.</p>
<p>This applies to the physical world, just as it does to the psychological, social, and meaning worlds. It is never possible to get perfect control even over a simple mechanical device. I’ll give technical explanations for this later, in discussions of <a href="/dynamical-chaos">dynamical chaos↗︎︎</a> and the <a href="#chap95">objective inseparability</a> of objects. A simple way to see it, though: your device could always get hit by meteor, at any time, and then it will stop doing what you want. This is very unlikely, but shows that the world is never perfectly predictable.</p>
<p>Most activities involve other people, who are notoriously difficult to control. Even the most powerful tyrant cannot entirely manage it. Worse, perhaps, you cannot always control even yourself. Sometimes you find yourself doing things you hadn’t intended, and will probably regret later, because it’s what you want at the time. And, even when events go according to plan, their meanings may squirm out from under you. The outcome you so desired may be, objectively, just as you wanted it—and yet it no longer seems significant, as it did when you began. (I’ll say more about each of these types of failure of control later on this page.)</p>
<p>Overall, nebulosity often seems the main obstacle to control,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_fx672qc" id="extra29_footnoteref1_fx672qc" title="Not always, of course; sometimes you simply lack the prerequisites needed for a course of action which would be highly likely to succeed if you had then.">1</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss6')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> the main resource. Nebulosity, therefore, often becomes the hated enemy. Eternalism promises to make nebulosity go away by <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixating', 'gloss7')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixating</a> patterns, making complete control possible. Of course, it cannot.</p>
<p>Fortunately, nebulosity is not actually a hostile force. It delivers unexpected opportunities, and surprising good outcomes as well as bad ones. Learning to appreciate nebulosity is an important way out of eternalism and into the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss8')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_pattern">Pattern makes interaction possible</h2>
<p>In the ideal situation of perfect control, you could make anything you want happen simply by choosing it. You would be unconstrained—causally unaffected—by the outside world. Control would flow only outward from you toward the world. The <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control">locus of control↗︎︎</a></dfn> would be purely <dfn>internal</dfn> to you.</p>
<p>In the opposite extreme, you would be entirely controlled by the world, and any choices you might make would be meaningless. The locus of control would be entirely <dfn>external</dfn>, and causality would flow only inward, from the world acting on you.</p>
<p>Neither of these extremes occurs in reality. Ultimately, this is a fact of physics; causality is always distributed, and one thing cannot affect another without also being affected by it to some extent.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_pm9ez1x" id="extra29_footnoteref2_pm9ez1x" title="At the level of fundamental physics, all forces are symmetrical; they act mutually on pairs of particles. This is not much relevant to everyday life, however. I’ll explain a more relevant, macroscopic understanding of distributed causality on the discussion of dynamical chaos.">2</a> However, it’s also obvious in everyday life, so long as you look without forcing an extreme internalist or externalist view.</p>
<p>Locus of control, in other words, is always nebulous: partial, shifting, uncertain, ambiguous. This is partly because the self/other boundary is itself nebulous; it’s often unclear what is “me” and what is “that.” Partly self and other are nebulous because locus of control is nebulous; these are, in part, two ways of saying the same thing. (This is a key aspect of my analysis of <a href="#chap104">what “self” means</a>.)</p>
<p>Because “control” is often understood as “complete control,” an alternate vocabulary may be useful. One might speak of “influence,” meaning partial control, for example. This is somewhat misleading, though, by suggesting that you are active and the world is passive (although passive-aggressive: it doesn’t always do what you tell it).</p>
<p>I prefer the word <dfn>interaction</dfn>: it suggests that both you and the world are actively participating in determining what happens.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_ddw0k4h" id="extra29_footnoteref3_ddw0k4h" title="“Interaction” is still somewhat misleading, unfortunately. It suggests that there are two or more objectively separate parties involved, which is not true.">3</a> “Interaction” covers causality shared with both the non-human world and with other people.</p>
<p><dfn>Improvisation</dfn> is characteristic of interaction. Because the world is nebulous, you can’t plan in advance everything you are going to do. You always have to figure some actions out as you go along. Usually, when the time comes, it’s obvious what you need to do, although you could not have foreseen it.</p>
<p><dfn>Collaboration</dfn> is the most important form of interaction.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_2lw5gbf" id="extra29_footnoteref4_2lw5gbf" title="My prehistoric PhD thesis was also about improvisation and collaboration, and the impossibility of control. Some people just don’t know when to move on in life.">4</a> Most human activities involve other people. Human interactions may be hostile; not all are collaborations. But collaborations are the most valuable, and most interesting (to me at least).</p>
<p>Practical activity is a spontaneous partner dance. You are continually responsive to the details of your unfolding situation, as revealed by perception. It is futile to try to force interactions to conform to a preconceived idea of how things should go.</p>

</figure>
<p>“Control” sometimes has negative connotations, and “collaboration” positive ones. However, my point is not moral or political. The issue here is not that control is <em>not nice</em>, it’s that complete control is physically impossible.</p>
<p>So long as you recognize that nebulosity is inevitable, there is nothing necessarily wrong with seeking partial control. Sometimes it’s even ethically imperative to get as much control as possible; for example in designing and operating a nuclear power plant.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_382a1um" id="extra29_footnoteref5_382a1um" title="Even there, tsunamis (for instance) make complete control impossible. Recognizing this, the trend in nuclear reactor design has been from active to passive safety. Active control makes human activity the locus, along with complex electrical systems to which humans delegate. It’s external to the reactor. Passive safety shifts the locus into the reactor itself. For example, in some designs, when things go wrong, it shuts down by literally falling apart. Gravity does the work.">5</a></p>

I have linked some topics to relevant Wikipedia pages, which could be starting points if you would like to investigate further. (As of mid–2015, most of the Wikipedia articles are not very good, but their references may be useful.) I have not found good overall review articles. This may be because control has been studied by many different branches of psychology, using different frameworks and terminology that are difficult to align. “Born to Choose: The Origins and Value of the Need for Control” includes a not-terrible survey.">6</a> has shown that most people <em>overestimate</em> how much control they have—or could get—most of the time. This has several objectively harmful effects.</p>
<p>If you believe you have more control than you do, you are likely to take larger risks than you should. Experiments (and everyday experience) show that overconfidence leads to gambling-like behavior. It accounts for a lot of stupid accidents and bad life-decisions.</p>
<p>Overconfidence that you can eventually get control (through practice, or by applying bigger hammers) can make you waste time and resources trying to control the uncontrollable. Combined with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">sunk cost fallacy↗︎︎</a>, this can lead to applying ever increasing resources to an unworkable strategy. Believing that control must always be possible makes it difficult to learn from failure. Each disaster looks like a mere temporary setback, and you may take it as evidence that even more violent effort is called for.</p>
<p>Eternalism can make anything less than complete control emotionally unacceptable. Letting go, and accepting partial control, may seem too threatening. Then you may pursue control <em>for its own sake</em>, even when it has no objective benefit, or when the costs of maintaining control are obviously too high.</p>
<p>Control is only ever partial; but eternalistic hope for complete control can lead to over-controlling. That is the counter-productive application of extra force, complexity, or rigidity, when those actually result in <em>less</em> control, not more; or when the cost of increasing control outweighs its benefits.</p>
<p>Since it is pattern that makes partial control possible, over-control often attempts to <a href="#chap39">impose a pattern</a> by brute force. The pattern may be a real one that just doesn’t fit the situation (you are not actually that person’s best friend, so they aren’t going to do that task for you); or it may be an entirely imaginary one (you can’t actually find a cure for your retinopathy using tarot cards). Eternalism often leads to inventing spurious patterns that would grant control, and clinging to them even when there’s strong evidence against them, if that would mean loss of the illusion of control.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_te7rrp0" id="extra29_footnoteref7_te7rrp0" title="The gambler’s fallacy is a well-studied, if somewhat simplistic, example. “Interpretive control” is a broader psychology research term for inventing explanations in order to feel you have control when you don’t. See for instance Baumeister’s Meanings of Life, p. 42.">7</a></p>
<p>A strong emotional need for control may lead you to refuse to deal with parts of reality that you can’t control to your satisfaction. Some people organize their lives to avoid most social interactions, or responsibility for anything mechanical, or dealing with money—as much as possible. Abandoning the possibility of incomplete control can have a high cost, drastically narrowing the scope of your life.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_knmiq71" id="extra29_footnoteref8_knmiq71" title="Experimental psychology and psychotherapeutic theory corroborate most of the harmful control dynamics I describe here. Psychology has not found convincing reasons for them. They seem clearly maladaptive; so why do brains do these things? I suspect the answer is: eternalism, as such. The desire to believe that everything has a fixed meaning appears to be enormously powerful. It is significant that (as we’ll see in the next section) depression, which is the negation of eternalism, reverses most of these control dynamics. Although eternalism is partly innate, it is strongly reinforced by modern Western culture. It would be interesting to see whether harmful control dynamics are less prevalent among hunter-gatherer peoples, for instance. Based on the little I know of the relevant cognitive anthropology, I suspect the answer is yes.">8</a></p>
<p>One common response to nebulosity is excessive, obsessive planning: trying to figure out everything that could go wrong, and what you’d do if it did. Sometimes this is wise, but when you don’t fully understand the pattern, planning may be impossible. Over-control and planning also blind you to serendipity and unexpected opportunities.</p>
<p>Often it is better to observe the actual pattern, and to intervene minimally in its flow as events unfold. This skillful improvisation—often coupled with collaboration—can redirect existing forces in the direction you want.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_dnm55q9" id="extra29_footnoteref9_dnm55q9" title="I wrote about this in more detail, but in a rather different conceptual framework, in “Unclogging.”">9</a> Such interaction doesn’t provide complete control, but may give better results. It also allows you to change course when new positive possibilities open.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_breakdown">Breakdown</h2>
<p>Eternalism promises complete control, but cannot deliver. How to sustain the illusion, when non-control becomes obvious?</p>
<p>The first response is to invent an excuse. Eternalism explains away each failure as a one-off special situation that does not predict future lack of control.</p>
<p>The excuses given by American government agencies and multinational CEOs are essentially the same as those of African witchdoctors and of drug addicts everywhere. This is highly amusing once you notice the pattern.</p>
<p>No one ever says “We mostly don’t understand what is going on; the effects of our actions are inherently unpredictable; and our motivations are mixed, so we often undermine our own effectiveness.” (Even though that’s always the truth for everyone and every organization.) Instead: </p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Adverse global economic conditions</li>
<li>Sudden ripening of negative karma from a previous life</li>
<li>It’s society’s fault</li>
<li>Profits were impacted by supply chain issues</li>

<p>Such excuses explain that the failure occurred only because you <em>didn’t</em> have control at the time. Therefore past failure doesn’t predict future failure, because of course in the future you <em>will</em> have control. Having control is “normal,” and should always be expected.</p>
<p>At some point, excuses run out, and the illusion of control collapses. Fear is the natural reaction to being out of control; and it can help deal with some bad situations. However, an eternalistic need to always maintain control can cause constant anxiety or even paranoia.</p>
<p>The eternalistic all-or-nothing tendency makes the sense of control brittle. Any temporary setback may flip you from an illusion of control into the illusion of no-control.</p>

<p>Perceived lack of control results in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness↗︎︎</a>—inhibition of practical action—which is believed to be closely related to depression.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_9duxjj5" id="extra29_footnoteref13_9duxjj5" title="The resulting psychological stress can be literally lethal in experimental animals.">13</a> Similarly, people who experience an external locus of control have been shown to be prone to clinical depression.</p>

<p>This is obvious to anyone who has struggled to lose weight.</p>
<p>Eternalism wants to see the self as unitary, separate, durable, consistent, and well-defined—because then it could be in control. We are none of those things. Our selves are inherently, inescapably nebulous; and therefore uncontrollable. </p>
<p>It is often more accurate to see one’s self as a community of divergent, competing desires, with constantly-shifting political coalitions among them. Depending on which have the upper hand at any moment, the actions one chooses change. This frequently undermines plans and intentions. When desire for romance gains power, it forms a firm intention to avoid ice cream to lose weight and become more attractive; but when dessert time comes, desire for noms foments rebellion.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_gsmomzx" id="extra29_footnoteref14_gsmomzx" title="George Ainsle’s Breakdown of Will is an outstanding analysis of this pattern, technically termed akrasia.">14</a></p>
<p>Many excuses—particularly the excuses you make to yourself—boil down to “it wasn’t <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss15" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss15')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> me who did that.” (“Everybody knows I’m not that kind of guy!”) At some level, this is outrageously hypocritical; but it is also honest and accurate. The political coalition of desires that drove drunk was not the same coalition that regrets it the next morning—and those coalitions are more-or-less what we call a “self.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_3nt7hoc" id="extra29_footnoteref15_3nt7hoc" title="Breakdown of Will and The Guru Papers both provide much insight here.">15</a></p>
<p>Consistent choices would also depend on a clear boundary between “me in here” and “the world out there.” The self/other boundary is always somewhat nebulous, however; so you cannot make perfectly independent choices. The more open you are to others, the less control you have. You probably wouldn’t have driven home drunk if your friends at the bar hadn’t done the same.</p>
<p>Disgust with your own inconsistency motivates the stance of <a href="#chap107">True Self</a>. That would be “who I really am”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_70dbtnz" id="extra29_footnoteref16_70dbtnz" title="This is an interesting example of the weaselly function of the word “really.”">16</a>—a unitary, separate, durable, consistent, and well-defined ideal. The “false self” is the divided, easily-influenced, impetuous, devious, incoherent one. If only you could become your True Self, you would be perfectly virtuous and always in control.</p>
<p>The True Self stance motivates over-control of your desires, and totalitarianism in your internal politics. The supposed True Self—itself actually just a coalition of impulses, fantasies, and fears—becomes a tyrant. It enforces a rigid personal morality and exiles the rest of the self to a dank prison cell. Fearing internal anarchy, it suppresses most enjoyment, creativity, and spontaneity, lest they undermine its control. Festering in the dark, these suppressed self-fragments grow monstrous, twisted, powerful. When eventually they break out in revolt, the carnage can be gruesome.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_mpbekoh" id="extra29_footnoteref17_mpbekoh" title="I wrote about aspects of this in “We are all monsters,” “Eating the shadow,” and “Black magic, transformation, and power.” See also Breakdown of Will, The Guru Papers, and A Little Book on the Human Shadow, which discuss the pattern extensively.">17</a></p>
<p>A healthy self is a series of negotiated compromises among hopes, fears, projects, desires, and relationships, based on recognition that complete control is impossible, so all aspects of the self get enough of what they need that conflict is minimized.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_others">Control of others is impossible (and attempts are harmful)</h2>
<p>To gain complete control over your own life, you would need to control other people. Not only their actions, but also their thoughts and feelings—because those interact with your own.</p>
<p>Complete control of people is even more impossible than complete control of the inanimate world. Partial control or influence, by various means, is possible, and may often be benign.

<h2 id="extra29_proxy">Control by proxy</h2>
<p>Identifying your self with a more powerful proxy can give a vicarious sense of control. This is a back-up strategy when personal control is too obviously impossible.</p>
<p>Proxies include individuals, such as political and religious leaders; social groups, such as tribes, nations, and sects; imaginary people, such as God, gods, or culture-heroes; and abstractions, such as political and religious ideologies. </p>
<p>This illusion of control depends on psychological identification, allegiance, and surrender. You have to give up your own control—in a particular area of life, at least—to transfer the locus to the proxy. Psychological surrender gives a feeling of connection or union with something much greater and more meaningful than your personal concerns.</p>
<p>Feeling that you are part of a group allows you to participate emotionally in its strength and success. This is true even when the tribe—or its leaders—do not provide you with any actual control over your life. Sports fandoms are a benign example. Oppressive political regimes that maintain popular support are perhaps the worst. Vicarious power through identification with the state seems an acceptable trade-off to many subjects.</p>
<p>In fact, this dynamic seems to underly most malign power relationships, ranging from domestic abuse through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome">Stockholm syndrome↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/11/22/renunciation-in-buddhism/">anti-life religions↗︎︎</a> to totalitarian dystopias.

Dualism denies connections and fixates boundaries.</p>
<p>Control usually depends on boundaries, connections, or both. Since both are ubiquitous, it’s usually best to consider and manipulate both. However, the monism and dualism’s denials lead them to ignore one, and to try to exert control only through the other.</p>
<p>Monism attempts control exclusively through connections. When genuine connections do not permit control, it invents imaginary ones. This is typical of <a href="#chap41">magical thinking</a>. “Psychic powers,” New Age quack therapies, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction_%28New_Thought%29">Law of Attraction↗︎︎</a> are typical examples.</p>
<p>Dualism attempts control exclusively through boundaries: categorizing, discriminating, separating, sorting, ranking, and <a href="#chap55">purifying</a>.

</figure>
<p>Popular “spiritual” books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002M5E2DW/?tag=meaningness-20">The Secret↗︎︎</a> recommend abandoning all attempts at control, or even action, in favor of spiritual virtue (“positive thinking”). This is an extreme version of control-by-proxy, in which the proxy is the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss24" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss24')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.

<p>This approach is typical in <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss19" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss19')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

Any attempt to act on your own simply limits you, by creating an artificial and illusory separation.</p>
<p>Renunciation often acts as a moralistic reward fantasy. For monism, control is <em>not OK</em>, because control depends on differences, which monism denies. Since everything is the same, everything is equal, and nothing can be allowed to control anything else. Giving up control is a supremely virtuous act, which The Entire Universe rewards by showering you with everything you could possibly want.</p>
<p>Obviously, adopting this strategy leads to severe emotional dysfunction, passive-aggressive relationships, and total inability or unwillingness to deal with everyday responsibilities.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_boring">Control is intolerably dull</h2>
<p>Total control (which requires total predictability) is totally boring. Life needs some challenges, surprises, setbacks, and serendipity to make it interesting. Enjoyment and personal growth come only with partial control.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote19_e98ruz7" id="extra29_footnoteref19_e98ruz7" title="This point was made famous by Csikszentmihalyi’s book Flow: The psychology of optimal experience. See also my post “Tantra and flow.”">19</a></p>
<p>Highly-successful people, whose lives are too much under control, often semi-deliberately mess them up, for example with an extramarital affair whose revelation destroys their career as well as their marriage. The thrill of risk, and the difficulty of avoiding detection, breaks the monotony of excessive control. It is better, of course, to leave what is going well on autopilot, and to take on greater challenges in new domains.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_meaningness">Meanings are out of control</h2>
<p>Meaningness itself is nebulous, and therefore uncontrollable. This undermines practical activity that attempts to control meaningful conditions. Nebulosity of meaning implies constant uncertainty about the merits of purposes; about what counts as progress and setbacks; about what methods would be ethical or unethical; about how your choices shape and are shaped by your self; and about implications that may go beyond the personal, immediate, and obvious, into the greater, mysterious patterns of meaning claimed by religion and social philosophy.</p>
<p>“<a href="#chap24">The puzzle of meaningness</a>” illustrates many aspects of these problems in the context of an adultery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attraction was overwhelming. The sex was scalding. You loved with a passion you had never felt before.</p>
<p>In time, it waned; and you ended the affair.</p>
<p>Now, you wonder: <em>what did that mean</em>? In the beginning, it seemed enormously significant. By the end, it had slid into a casual friendship plus sex.</p>
<p>Were you mistaken in thinking it was meaningful at the start? Or did it have a meaning that it lost?</p>
<p>And was the affair right, or wrong, or perhaps somehow somewhere in-between?</p>
<p>What does it mean about you that you cheated—which you were sure you never would do? Should you be less certain about yourself in other ways?</p>
<p>Marriage is a sacrament; but this affair also seemed at first to have a sacred dimension. Was that just a self-justifying illusion?</p>

It is significant that (as we’ll see in the next section) depression, which is the negation of eternalism, reverses most of these control dynamics. Although eternalism is partly innate, it is strongly reinforced by modern Western culture.

<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_elaborating">Elaborating meanings of good and bad</h2>
<p>Eternalism is about seeing meaning where there is none, and adding extra meaning even to what is already genuinely meaningful. Chance events—turns of the wheel of fortune—are taken not just as good or bad, but <em>meaningfully</em> good or bad.</p>
<p>Eternalism gives good and bad events implications for all the dimensions—purpose, ethics, our selves, social relations, and so on. Good outcomes are mistaken as rewards or confirmations. Bad ones appear as omens of still worse to come, or deserved punishments, or as tests from God.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis">just world hypothesis↗︎︎</a>” is the pervasive assumption—explicit or tacit—that good and bad outcomes are not random, but deserved. The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss4')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a> guarantees that. This is the beginning of the elaboration of good and bad into good and evil. Good and Evil often become independent actors: as vague “forces,” or personified as spooks,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_kjfthif" id="extra29_footnoteref2_kjfthif" title="Benevolent and malevolent spooks, as causal explanations for good and bad outcomes, are a cultural universal.

I find it sad and telling that few care what spooks think or do when it doesn’t affect humans.">2</a> human individuals, or social groups.</p>
<p>Eternalistic systems typically promise good outcomes—for those who obey the demands of the eternal ordering principle. Bad outcomes are due to violations of the cosmic order. Violations can be reversed by <a href="#chap55">purification</a>, which restores the order.</p>
<p>If the eternal order can be violated, then how is it eternal? And, how can bad things happen to good people? Many outcomes are obviously random; eternalism is obviously wrong, <a href="#chap43">as everyone knows</a> at some level. Various <a href="#chap38">strategies of self-delusion</a> cover this up, in order to preserve an optimistic outlook. Elaborate theories of cosmic justice in the afterlife are attempts to preserve eternalism against everyday experience. When these eternalistic ploys fail, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss5')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

<h2 id="extra29_supernaturalism">Good, bad, naturalism, and supernaturalism</h2>

<p><a href="#chap59">A major theme</a> of <a href="#chap29">this chapter on eternalism</a> is that errors usually attributed to supernaturalist religions are also common among atheists, and in naturalistic ideologies. This includes mistaken ideas about good and bad—but those <em>are</em> particularly prone to supernatural explanations.</p>
<p>In the short run, good and bad manifest as <dfn>luck</dfn>. A feeling of being lucky, or unlucky, is <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/May-You-Have-My-Luck/151627/">nearly impossible↗︎︎</a> for even the most committed secular scientific rationalist to avoid at times. “<a href="#chap30">I get duped by eternalism in a casino</a>” is a personal account of such an incident. In “<a href="https://approachingaro.org/no-cosmic-justice">No cosmic justice↗︎︎</a>” I observed that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A vague, incoherent expectation of cosmic justice is one of the hardest aspects of our Christian heritage to shake off. I am a life-long atheist, and have never actually believed in cosmic justice. Yet I still sometimes catch myself hoping that I will somehow be magically rewarded for good deeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#chap41">Magical thinking</a> is a powerful eternalist ploy. It promises certainty about the spinning wheel of fortune, through esoteric techniques such as divination, psychobabble, and career counseling. Imaginary connections “explain” random coincidences. Underlying all this is the assumption that the universe is <em>about us</em>—and since our lives are meaningful, everything else must be, too.</p>
<p>Explicitly non-supernatural eternalisms make the same promises. Communism guarantees a good outcome for history: eventually capitalism <a href="#chap51">must</a> collapse, and be replaced by a worker’s paradise. <a href="#chap62">UFO cults</a> expect imminent salvation by benevolent aliens. Techno-futurists are sure a <a href="/techno-futurism">Singularity↗︎︎</a> will soon deliver us from all material afflictions (or perhaps doom us to sudden extinction). These are all silly, but they postulate no supernatural forces.</p>

<p>In the long run, eternalism sees good and bad as the concern of <dfn>fate</dfn>.

Some events are unambiguously one way or another; but even the most important ones usually have both good and bad aspects. We acknowledge this in phrases like “a silver lining” and “a mixed blessing.” </p>

<p>Qualifying judgements of good and bad is essential in adequate approaches to ethics and politics, particularly. (These will develop into major points later in the book.)</p>

<p>Interpreting good and bad as good and evil turns them into absolutes, over which no compromise is possible. Ever-escalating embroilment ensues. Dropping good and evil is a first step toward a non-eternalist ethics. (Although only a first step—replacing them with “harm and benefit” can lead to <a href="#chap70">eternalist utilitarianism</a>, for instance. Those, too, are nebulous—so utilitarianism can’t succeed as an eternalist system.)</p>
<p>For politics to be anything more than a quantitative showdown, both sides in a conflict must recognize the nebulosity of their interests. Not only are <em>those people</em> not simply evil, and <em>us folks</em> not simply holy: what they <em>want</em> is not purely wrong, and what we want is not an unalloyed good. When all can drop the moral posturing, all may be able to work together to find an outcome all can live with—which will not be good, bad, or uninteresting, but a nebulous combination of all three.</p>

<p>Increasingly many Westerners have abandoned organized religion, but surprisingly few say they are atheists. They may say “I don’t believe in God, exactly, not as a person, but I believe in <em>something</em>—maybe you could say a higher power, or the universe as a whole, or maybe it’s love—it doesn’t really matter what you call it.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_eit4xwb" id="extra29_footnoteref1_eit4xwb" title="For instance, in a controversial interview, Oprah Winfrey told atheist Diana Nyad “I think if you believe in the awe and the wonder [of nature], and the mystery, then that is what God is.

<h2 id="extra29_stupid">We are not stupid enough for eternalism</h2>
<p>Eternalism comes naturally; human brains evolved to <a href="#chap10_patternicity">hallucinate meaning</a> where there is none. Any other <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss8')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a> takes at least a little thought. <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Nihilism', 'gloss9')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">Nihilism</a>, especially, is difficult. It's only possible to maintain nihilism using sophisticated rationalizations that explain away obvious meaningfulness. Other, more complex stances depend on dubious metaphysical distinctions that take work to apply in concrete circumstances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, eternalism is obviously wrong. Everyone can see that many events are <a href="#chap26_eternalism">completely meaningless</a>, and the meanings <a href="#chap24">even of important ones</a> are often <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss10')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>.</p>
<p>To maintain eternalism, you have to <a href="#chap48">deliberately stupefy yourself</a>. You need to damage your own natural intelligence to not-see nebulosity and to preserve illusions of meaningfulness and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss11')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">cosmic order</a>. Starting on the next page, I'll explain various mind-killing <a href="#chap38">ploys</a> you can use to hide eternalism’s failures and lies.</p>
<p>Eternalism can provide bogus <em>feelings</em> of intelligence, from perceiving <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterns', 'gloss12')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterns</a> that aren't there. This is the rush of excitement as the new convert to an eternalist system “discovers” that Mindfulness or Marx or Mormonism <a href="#chap33">explains everything</a>. Desire for meaning makes you willing to <a href="#chap49">sabotage your critical ability</a>, in order to accept preposterous stories in which the Cosmic Plan makes everything make sense. That inhibits curiosity and the natural drive to find a better understanding.</p>
<p>In the end, no one can make themselves stupid enough to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'accomplish', 'gloss13')" title="“Accomplishing” a stance means adopting it consistently whenever its dimension of meaningness comes up.  This is difficult and rare; perhaps psychologically impossible. [Click for details.]">accomplish</a> eternalism—to maintain the stance at all times. Everyone, at times, does recognize nebulosity—and so <a href="#chap58">moves into some other stance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_regressive">Eternalism is regressive and addictive</h2>
<p>Eternalism is comforting, when life is going well enough. Then you can choose to ignore the ways reality fails to fit <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss14" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss14')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> meanings. Eternalism’s promises of <a href="#chap42">hope</a> and <a href="#chap43">solace</a> seem credible. You can live in a <a href="#chap46">pastel fantasy world</a>. So eternalism “works” as long you can maintain a childish, self-indulgent obliviousness—which is its characteristic emotional texture.</p>
<p>Maintaining eternalism requires emotional regression, into a toddler’s bedroom, watched over by a wise protecting parent: the Cosmic Plan, or some authority who poses as its representative. When you are unable to keep deluding yourself, you look for someone more powerful to do the job: someone or something that can affirm eternalism in the face of your perception of the contradictory evidence. The parent-figure promises to protect you from nebulosity. You choose this relationship specifically to obstruct <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">emotional and intellectual growth↗︎︎</a> when that seems too frightening.</p>
<p>Preserving comforting illusions may be psychologically valuable in the short run, in times of crisis: as antidotes to depression, anxiety, and despair. (Those are symptoms of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss1')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>, which may be the only accessible alternative to eternalism for some people.) In the longer run, this pain-killing function leads to helplessness and <a href="#chap30_eternalismisanaddiction">addiction</a>.</p>
<p>As the opening paragraph of this page suggested, a relationship with eternalism may resemble addictive dynamics of domestic abuse, which keep a victim returning to the abuser. The victim believes—rightly or wrongly—that they are powerless, and that the abuser is powerful. The victim hopes that the abuser would act as a protector against the world, if properly propitiated. This requires the victim to delude themselves that the abuser has loving intentions, and that the abuse episodes are somehow be triggered by the victim’s inadequacy.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_practical">Eternalism has bad practical results</h2>
<p>Eternalism promises eternally good feelings. And it <em>is</em> a comforting ride—until it crashes into reality and you get hurled from your seat onto the open highway.</p>
<p>Meanings have consequences. Meaning is not an autonomous domain, disconnected from practical reality; everyone frequently acts on the basis of perceived meanings. But those are <a href="#chap41">often wrong</a>. Eternalism says the world is good, and I am good, so if I choose to do something good, then the result <a href="#chap51">must be</a> good! But often it isn’t.</p>
<p>As we saw earlier, eternalism’s <a href="#chap33">illusions of understanding</a> and <a href="#chap34">control fantasies</a> often lead over-confidence, excess risk-taking, over-control, and other unrealistic patterns of action. Alternatively, the delusion that you <em>must</em> base action on the Cosmic Plan leads to paralysis when you are unable to discern what it demands. (This is particularly common in the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss4')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a>, which is closely related to eternalism.)</p>
<p>Acting based on imagined meanings frequently fails. Harm and pain ensue. Eternalism’s synthetic certainty ensures that this comes as a shock, each time. Each time, one experiences it <a href="#chap83">as a betrayal</a>. I am a good person; this wasn’t supposed to happen to me!</p>
<p>Then, disillusioned, you may <a href="#chap58">exit eternalism</a> into another stance. Alternatively, you may apply <a href="#chap38">ploys</a> to maintain eternalism—probably in an increasingly shaky, wavering form.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_painful">Wavering eternalism is emotionally painful</h2>
<p>Eternalism persuades you that you <em>should</em> maintain the stance at all times. This has moral force; if you <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss17" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'waver', 'gloss17')" title="When you have committed to a stance, but have not accomplished it, then you are “wavering.”  Wavering means that you are trying to adopt a stance consistently, but are finding it difficult or impossible to do so. [Click for details.]">waver</a> in your commitment, you are a bad person. However, it is impossible to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'accomplish', 'gloss13')" title="“Accomplishing” a stance means adopting it consistently whenever its dimension of meaningness comes up.  This is difficult and rare; perhaps psychologically impossible. [Click for details.]">accomplish</a> consistent eternalism. This implies perpetual struggle, with shame and guilt at imperfection, and much wasted effort.</p>
<p>The wavering eternalist <a href="#chap52">feels intense confusion</a> during <a href="#chap50">periods of doubt</a>.</p>
<p>When eternalism fails, it <a href="#chap53">tries to convince you</a> that it’s your fault, for wavering, for not trying hard enough, for being unworthy of the Cosmic Plan. Then you may punish yourself—as harshly as you can, to demonstrate your renewed commitment. (The Cosmic Plan can’t punish you adequately; it doesn’t exist!)</p>
<p>As you repeatedly experience eternalism failing when it encounters nebulosity, you develop fear and loathing of ambiguity and change. You come to <a href="#chap45">avoid areas of life</a> that seem particularly nebulous. This progressively narrows your scope for action, leading to rigidity or even paralysis. You may <a href="#chap45">isolate yourself</a> socially: from everyone, or into a <a href="#chap44">closed group that agrees</a> to pretend eternalism works. You may adopt an <a href="#chap47">aggressive hostility toward</a> anyone who reminds you of nebulosity.</p>
<p>You may come to feel cramped and imprisoned in the <a href="#chap56">small safe space</a> where eternalism seems to function. Creativity and daring become impossible.</p>
<p>You somehow cannot find your true <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss4')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a> in life, for which eternalism would guarantee success.

Sometimes, you believe you <em>have</em> found your true self and mission, and go off on a fantastical ego-trip crusade, which needs constant confirmation from followers and eventually ends in catastrophe.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_immoral">Eternalism is immoral</h2>
<p>The eternal ordering principle is a cruel tyrant. The Cosmic Plan makes insane demands—and calls that morality. It sometimes commands harmful actions; it often fails to promote beneficial ones. Following its dictates causes damage to yourself and others.</p>

<p>You will find all of them familiar, either from personal use or from overhearing them used. Still, it may be useful to read the explicit analyses, because the concept of “eternalist ploys” may provide new insight into their operation.</p>
<p>The ploys are particularly easy to observe in religious fundamentalism and political extremism. Such systems use them in heavy-handed, clumsy ways, making them obvious. In this section, I mainly describe the ploys as methods for fooling yourself; but priests and politicians use them rhetorically to fool others too. Later in the book, I discuss eternalism as a route to social power.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_groups">Four groups of eternalist ploys</h2>
<p>I have categorized the ploys into four groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>By definition, eternalism means seeing everything as meaningful—although most things aren’t. The first group of ploys <dfn>hallucinate meanings</dfn> where there are none.</li>
<li>Many things are obviously meaningless, or have obviously <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss7')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a> meanings. The second groups of ploys <dfn>blind you to meaninglessness</dfn> and nebulosity.</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s impossible not to perceive meaninglessness, and so all those ploys fail. The third group <dfn>explains away meaninglessness</dfn>.</li>
<li>Finally, if meaninglessness cannot be explained away, you have to react in some way. The fourth group tries to cope with meaninglessness when it’s unavoidable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, the ploys could be grouped based on whether they are typically used in <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss8')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monist</a> eternalism or <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualist', 'gloss9')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a> eternalism—or both. Most <em>are</em> used in both. However, <a href="#chap40">smearing meaning around</a>, <a href="#chap41">magical thinking</a>, and <a href="#chap52">bafflement</a> are particularly useful for monist eternalism. Similarly, <a href="#chap39">fixed meanings</a>, <a href="#chap45">hiding from nebulosity</a>, <a href="#chap47">arming</a>, and <a href="#chap55">purification</a> are particularly useful in dualist eternalism.</p>
<p class="meta_para">[I am unsure about my current list of ploys. They seem to overlap and run into each other somewhat, and I also expect I may find more of them. I may need to "refactor" the categories. Feedback about this would be welcome!</p>
<p class="meta_para">For now, I have provided unfinished versions of the pages describing the ploys. They are preliminary, incomplete drafts; I’ll come back and finish them when I’m more confident that overall scheme is correct. However, there should be enough explanation for each that you will understand how they work, and so can recognize them in operation.]</p>

<p>This ploy tries to force a pre-determined set of categories on experience. These often have fixed positive and negative values, and demand that you take particular actions in response to them. The “abominations” of the Old Testament are examples. “Stereotypes” are one contemporary secular manifestation.</p>
<p>Often these categories don’t fit, and the imposed meanings are wrong. When you act on them, reality eventually slaps you upside the head.

<p>Smeared-around meanings are usually vague. If something is labelled “inappropriate”: how, and why, and what does that actually imply?</p>
<p>Smearing is also usually quite undiscriminating about which things get what meanings. The important thing is that everything means <em>something</em>. Smearing accepts <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<p>For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional ways of knowing draw on the wisdom of nature, which the West has forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is almost perfectly vague, but expresses a strong value judgement nonetheless. Not only does it devalue “the West,” it also attempts to rescue “traditional ways of knowing” from the sensible judgement that they are sometimes idiotic and virtually meaningless. “Nature” and “wisdom” are sufficiently hand-wavy that they can justify almost anything—especially if they are supposed to be “<a href="#chap53">mysterious</a>” (to unenlightened Westerners, at least).</p>

<p>Smeared meanings cause trouble in almost the same way as fixed ones. They fail to fit reality, so acting on them has bad outcomes. Relying on “traditional ways of knowing” to handle an Ebola outbreak is a <em>really</em> bad idea.</p>
<p>The antidote to smearing, as with imposing, is to find out what things actually mean. If you find yourself smearing a lot, learning to be clear and specific is helpful, and some rigorous intellectual work is called for.

<p>Eternalism is the stance that <dfn>everything has a fixed meaning</dfn>. Magical thinking gives specific, wrong meanings to many meaningless events; and eternalism can be used as a theoretical framework for justifying the meanings given by magical thinking. (“It’s not just a naturally-occurring omen, it’s a message <em>from God</em>!”) So there is a powerful synergy between eternalism and magical thinking. In fact, most major religions probably began as systematic appropriations of everyday magical thinking by elite eternalist priesthoods.</p>
<p>However, magical thinking is not necessarily eternalist. For example, believing homeopathy works, without giving it any spiritual significance, is magical thinking—but not eternalism. On the other hand, if you think homeopathy has something to do with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss1')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

<p>Magical thinking causes harm when you act on mistaken causal beliefs and get bad results.</p>
<p>Part of the antidote to magical thinking is understanding that brains just naturally do it. You have to watch out for it. Once you see its patterns, catching it becomes automatic, and you can laugh at it.</p>

<p class="intro_para">Hope springs eternal… istically.</p>
<p>Hope shifts imagined meaning to the future, when the present is obviously meaningless.</p>
<p>Hope is harmful in devaluing the present and shifting attention to imaginary futures that may never exist. Hope causes emotional stunting and childishness. It is inimical to emotional growth.</p>
<p>This page will discuss the putative value of hopeful illusions as defenses against anxiety, depression, and despair. (The logic of that is really that hope is an antidote to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>, which is seen as the only alternative. That’s <a href="#chap54">a different ploy</a>.) It may function as a useful defense in emergencies, but illusion is counter-productive as a long-term or general strategy.</p>
<p>Even in crises, hope can be harmful. Since eternalism consists of blindness to nebulosity, it is destabilized by anything that brings nebulosity to our attention. Fortunately, nebulosity is indirectly visible in everyday life: as uncertainty, surprise, endings, confusion, breakdowns, and disagreement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when in the eternalist stance, it is usually only negative manifestations of nebulosity that can shock us out of blindness. Generally that leads to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

[Click for details.]">nihilism</a> rather than the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss2')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

This happens for all of us, frequently. “Damn, I seem to have inadvertently offended that person I met recently who I hoped might be a friend. Oh, well, I guess it was pointless to try anyway.” More dramatically, personal crises (such as the death of a family member) are probably the most common triggers for crises of religious faith.</p>
<p>Crisis, by destabilizing eternalism, can be an opening into either nihilism or the complete stance. We should prepare for this. In a crisis, we generally get caught up in strategic suffering, i.e. frantically trying to get the world to go back to behaving the way we think it ought to. It is difficult then to think about what may seem like abstract philosophical concerns. Knowing that unwanted events are likely to tip us into nihilism, knowing how to recognize nihilism as we shift into it, and knowing the antidotes to nihilism, is a first step. </p>
<p>I will discuss, in passing, hope as a Christian “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_%28virtue%29">theological virtue↗︎︎</a>.” This is hope specifically for salvation. It derives from will, not from the passions.</p>
<p>The antidote to hope is active acceptance of the present as it is, and prospective acceptance of the future, however it will be.</p>
<p>I have written about this from a Buddhist perspective at "<a href="https://vividness.live/2012/08/22/charnel-ground/">Charnel ground↗︎︎</a>" and "<a href="https://vividness.live/2012/09/11/pure-land/">Pure Land↗︎︎</a>"—a pair of essays that are best read together.</p>

<p>This is quite tricky, and must be done skillfully. There are always ethical complexities in trying to change other people.

<p>It’s difficult to apply this ploy as an individual. It’s more effective when applied by social groups (such as religious sects or fringe political movements).</p>

<p>This leads to a willfully idiotic sentimentality.  We try to live in a pastel-colored Disneyfied world in which everything works out for the best in the end, everyone is well-intentioned (although sometimes confused), there is a silver lining in every cloud, everyone is beautiful inside, when life gives you lemons you make lemonade, and all the world needs is love.  <a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_wgua0kf" id="extra29_footnoteref1_wgua0kf" title="According to the Talmud, every blade of grass has its own angel that watches over it and encourages it to grow.

<p>Kitsch is a refusal to seriously engage with spiritual problems.  Any anomalies are dismissed as being due to finite human understanding of God’s benevolent intent.  Reasonable faith is replaced with credulousness.</p>
<p>False and exaggerated emotion is characteristic of eternalist kitsch.</p>
<h2>The antidote to kitsch</h2>
<p>The antidote to kitsch is realism:  the acknowledgement of shit.  Realism requires no particular method or insight; merely willingness.  Kitsch is idiotic because we always know better; we just don’t want to admit it.</p>
<p>The danger in applying this antidote—and a reason we fear to do so—is that we may conclude that <em>everything</em> is shit.  That, however, is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss2')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

We must acknowledge <em>both</em> nebulosity and pattern.  The term “kitsch” comes from art criticism; it describes “art” that is self-consciously “beautiful” or sweet.  Art that is self-consciously ugly and repellent is equally false, and in recent decades has become equally trite.  Authentic art acknowledges the inseparability of light and darkness, and can be a path to non-duality.</p>

[Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> is obvious, eternalism fails to fit reality.  The response is to armor oneself against evidence, and to arm oneself to destroy it.</p>
<p><a href="#chap46">Kitschy sentimentality</a> can serve as armor against recognizing <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>. We blind ourselves to mystery; we try to make the world small and comfortable; and suffer when we encounter vastness.</p>
<p>The cost of armoring is blindness to opportunity. Much good is left undone because an eternalist code did not recommend it, and much harm is done because the code required it. Less obviously, but perhaps even more importantly, we lose the freedom of courage: the freedom to risk, to take actions whose results we cannot predict. Armored eternalism condemns such creativity.</p>
<p>When sentimentality feels threatened, it turns ugly—because the function of sentimentality is self-protection. Confronted with evidence that our code is imperfect, we retreat to a harsher, more restrictive code, and seek to impose it on the uncooperative world as well as ourselves. We become censorious and self-righteous. </p>
<p>When the armor wears thin, we crank it up into melodrama. We make ourselves up as heroes in the cosmic struggle between good and evil. Alas: those who are too sure they are on the side of God are capable of the greatest evil. Armed eternalism results in hostility, punishment of self and others, narrowness, bitterness, and brittleness.</p>
<p>When the supposed <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss3')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.

[Click for details.]">commitment</a> to eternalism, or one follows the prescription. If that has a bad outcome, one must blind oneself to the failure. We do that by hardening ourselves, and often also by hardening our interpretation of the code—against the temptation to weaken it to fit reality.</p>
<p>Eternalism makes you think “nice” people will behave the way you want them to. When they don’t, you demonize them, and try to control or punish them. In fact, Kundera’s theory of kitsch was motivated by his analysis of totalitarian communism in his native Czechoslovakia; totalitarianism, he concluded, is kitsch in government.</p>
<p>In the pathological extreme, armed eternalism sees any deviation as a threat that must be destroyed, and becomes sociopathic. We may launch witch-hunts, or conduct internal witch-hunts, scouring our own minds for evidence of sinful thoughts. Vast crimes have been justified in the name of eternalism: Inquisition, religious wars, and genocides.</p>
<p>Armed eternalism sees totalitarianism as the only defense against the <dfn>nihilist apocalypse</dfn>. (Of which, more in future chapters.) But the dichotomy between totalitarianism and apocalypse is false; due, as usual, to nihilism appearing to be the only alternative to eternalism.</p>
<p>The antidotes are relaxation and de-escalation. As you learn that nebulosity need not be negative, you can allow ambiguity increasingly. As you allow ambiguity, there is less and less need to war against evidence of it.</p>

<p class="intro_para"><dfn>Thought suppression</dfn> is the <a href="#chap38">eternalist ploy</a> that hides <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> and meaninglessness simply by rejecting thoughts that would make them obvious.</p>
<p>The thought “maybe everything is meaningless” might be intolerable. In your experience, it may lead immediately to full-blown <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss1')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>. So you choose not to think it.</p>
<p>It’s hard to choose never to think of something. (“Don’t think of a pink elephant.”) To suppress a thought effectively, you have to recognize warning signs that it’s coming. For instance, there are thoughts that tend to lead you to the one you want to avoid. “Maybe there’s nothing in particular I’m meant do with my life” can lead to “so maybe everything is meaningless” (although it <a href="#chap116">need not</a>). So it’s better not to think that either. And “I don’t really know what I’m meant to do with my life” leads to “maybe nothing,” so better not think that.</p>
<p>Since meaninglessness is so common, a multitude of observations and thoughts could eventually lead you to the wrong conclusion that everything is meaningless. The more often you apply thought suppression, the wider the domains of experience you have to blank.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_cliches">Thought-terminating clichés</h2>
<p>One tactic for stopping an unwanted train of thought is to apply a counter-thought.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_6ctliz2" id="extra29_footnoteref1_6ctliz2" title="Counter-thoughts can also be applied positively, to direct oneself into a complete stance.">1</a> Among these are <dfn>thought-terminating clichés</dfn>.</p>
<p>A cliché is a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss2')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> thought that ends an authentic line of inference. For example: “everyone is put on earth for a reason.” That ends patterns of thinking that might lead to “nothing really has any purpose.” This thought is not something you are likely to come up with yourself; it’s part of the <a href="https://approachingaro.org/thought-soup">thought soup↗︎︎</a> of our culture. You hear someone “wise” saying it when you are teenager, and take it over as your own. There’s no good reason to believe it, but you accept it originally on authority and then because it makes you feel better.</p>
<p>Here are some more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is someone for everyone.</li>
<li>His time had come, I guess.</li>
<li>Everything happens for the best.</li>
<li>Everything is part of the unfolding plan for the universe.</li>
<li>God works in mysterious ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>The term “thought-terminating cliché” comes from Robert J. Lifton’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006M9RZQA/?tag=meaningness-20">Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism↗︎︎</a>. This book has useful insights into several of the eternalist ploys. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis. In [Chinese Communist] thought reform, for instance, the phrase ‘bourgeois mentality’ is used to encompass and critically dismiss ordinarily troublesome concerns like the quest for individual expression, the exploration of alternative ideas, and the search for perspective and balance in political judgments. And in addition to their function as interpretive shortcuts, these cliches become what Richard Weaver has called “ultimate terms”: either “god terms,” representative of ultimate good; or “devil terms,” representative of ultimate evil. In thought reform, “progress,” “progressive,” “liberation,” “proletarian standpoints” and “the dialectic of history” fall into the former category; “capitalist,” “imperialist,” “exploiting classes,” and “bourgeois” (mentality, liberalism, morality, superstition, greed) of course fall into the latter. Totalist language then, is repetitiously centered on all-encompassing jargon, prematurely abstract, highly categorical, relentlessly judging, and to anyone but its most devoted advocate, deadly dull: in Lionel Trilling’s phrase, ‘the language of nonthought.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="extra29_punishingbadthoughts">Punishing bad thoughts</h2>
<p>Another tactic is punishing yourself for thinking unwanted thoughts.</p>
<p>Eternalist authorities recommend actively rooting about in your psyche to find bad (“sinful”) thoughts and punish them. These might be labelled as morally bad (so they deserve punishment); but they can be anything that contradicts the stance you are trying to maintain. For eternalism, lack of <a href="#chap48">faith</a> is a sin.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_harm">Harm</h2>
<p>Thought suppression leads to deliberate stupidity.</p>
<p>Thought suppression can be involved in <em>any</em> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stance', 'gloss3')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stance</a>. Every confused stance involves not-seeing something about meaning; suppressing thoughts that would lead to that could always help maintain the confusion. However, thought suppression is particularly characteristic of eternalism, because eternalism is <em>particularly</em> simple and stupid.</p>
<p>Thought suppression also leads to a sensation of claustrophobic imprisonment within a limited set of safe thoughts; of timidity in the face of the unfamiliar; and a strangled inability to express oneself.</p>
<p>A <a href="#extra7_comment-528">fascinating personal account</a> of the harm of thought suppression was posted as a comment on this site.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_antidote">Antidote</h2>
<p>The antidote is to allow thoughts.</p>
<p>For this, mindfulness meditation may be particularly useful. That mainly consists of non-judgmental awareness of thoughts. Since thoughts are mostly just junk we’ve taken over from our culture, you can regard them as not-particularly-mine. Therefore, they don’t say anything about “me,” which makes them less frightening.</p>
<p>In practicing mindfulness meditation, you discover what you think. This comes as a surprise to everyone!</p>

<p>Eternalism will let you down over and over—because the world isn’t actually as it promises. This can produce an addictive cycle. When vagueness and meaningless are less obvious, eternalism delivers its emotional rewards. When they are more obvious, chaos, confusion, pain and doubt arise. Then you wonder what you did wrong.

It is the next step when <a href="#chap52">faithful bafflement</a> fails.</p>
<p>Mystification uses thoughts as a weapon against authentic thinking. It creates glib, bogus metaphysical explanations that sweep meaninglessness under the rug. It can be vague, poetic, emotive (typical of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

[Click for details.]">dualist</a> mystification).</p>
<p>Eternalist ideologies claim to have all the answers. However, when push comes to shove, they admit that some things are mysterious. In fact, the mysteries turn out to include all the major questions about each of the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss4')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth.

<p>Still, eternalist ideologies insist that it is not mysterious <em>which</em> things are mysterious; nor <em>how</em> they are mysterious; nor what the mystery <em>means</em>. One is not to inquire into that which is mysterious, to come to have a tentative opinion about it. Mystery is not allowed to be mysterious: We know everything about it, says eternalism.</p>
<p>In fact, according to this ploy, mystery always means the same thing: <em>apparent meaninglessness is the very best proof that everything is meaningful</em>. Everything mysterious is bundled together and labeled “sacred” or “miraculous” or “cosmic.” Or, more specifically, “God’s plan, not for man to know”; or “the historically-inevitable working-out of class struggle”; or “the uncomputable but optimal decision strategy.”</p>
<p>Mystification produces half-assed mumbo-jumbo explanations. Acting based on these fails—naturally!—with more-or-less disastrous results.</p>
<p>The antidote to mystification is actual thinking. “Actual thinking” means not simply repeating thoughts you have taken over from an ideology, but active curiosity and investigation and questioning and reasoning. It involves skepticism; not the pseudo-skepticism of rejecting claims your tribe rejects, but actively wondering about how things are, and refusing to accept attractive stories that make no sense.</p>
<p>Thinking is a skill. There are many specific methods, taught for example in the “critical thinking” curriculum, and it is worth learning them. It is also important to realize that thinking must go beyond method.</p>
<p>Recognizing meaninglessness can be an opening into vastness. That is what mystification promises—but then it delivers the opposite. It gestures at vastness, but immediately closes it off by labeling it, and by pretending to explain some ultimate insight into its nature.</p>
<p>The best antidote to mystification is to appreciate, and open to, the experience of vastness. That is <dfn>wonderment</dfn>.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_apocalypse">The nihilist apocalypse</h2>
<p>This page, when finished, may introduce <dfn>the nihilist apocalypse</dfn>. I’ll definitely discuss that in several places later in the book, but this might be a good point to begin.</p>
<p>The nihilist apocalypse is the supposed catastrophe that would occur if nihilist views became widespread. In the imagination of some eternalists, eternalism is the only thing keeping the rabble in check. Nihilism, if widely adopted, leads to a world of total license, in which the masses naturally follow their basest instincts and engage in the worst sort of depravity.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_3dq86hf" id="extra29_footnoteref1_3dq86hf" title="The worst sort of depravity involves aardvarks. Just so you know. The details can only be hinted at, of course. It’s probably best just to avoid aardvarks altogether.">1</a> The dangerous idea that there are no absolute moral rules gradually spreads from the decadent intelligentsia to the coarse lower classes, who then lose all respect for authority, indulge in their natural promiscuity, breed like rabbits, play vile music, worship blood-drinking demons, casually commit rape and murder, tear down all institutions, destroy Western civilization, and let loose a wave of anarchy and violence that precipitates a thousand-year Dark Age.</p>
<p>Social breakdown is not impossible, and nihilistic ideas are indeed harmful to social cohesion. However, the apocalyptic worst-case fantasy is unrealistic. It’s highly exaggerated, precisely because eternalism is also unrealistic. Only extreme threats justify extreme solutions—and eternalism is extreme.</p>
<p>The nihilist apocalypse often features in the rhetoric of political and ethical eternalism.</p>

A first step toward <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'accomplishing', 'gloss8')" title="“Accomplishing” a stance means adopting it consistently whenever its dimension of meaningness comes up.

Becoming aware of movements among stances, and what triggers them, helps you understand the emotional dynamics of each. Learning to recognize the promises a stance makes, and reflecting on its repeated failure to deliver, kills the allure for you—and then you can escape its grip.</p>

<p>Because eternalism is the simplest, most basic <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused', 'gloss5')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused</a> stance, you may transition from it to almost any other. Exiting one of the more specific stances, discussed later in the book, typically can lead to only a few others. I’ll discuss likely exit moves for each stance in the chapter about it. (The <a href="#chap22">schematic overview</a> of stances also lists the most likely next stances adopted when exiting each.)</p>
<p>From eternalism, there are three groups of stances you might move to: quasi-eternalistic stances, nihilism and quasi-nihilistic stances, and the complete stance.</p>
<p>The most closely allied stances are “circumscribed eternalisms.” These admit that some things are not meaningful, but insist on fixed meanings for others. For example, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mission', 'gloss10')" title="“Mission” is the stance that holds that only your unique, eternal, transcendent purpose is truly meaningful. [Click for details.]">mission</a> says that “mundane” purposes are meaningless, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss11')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>, but insists that “eternal” purposes are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimately', 'gloss12')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimately</a> meaningful. Such stances preserve much of the feeling-tone of eternalism. They are attractive when eternalism’s promises still seem generally plausible, but when its absolutism is obviously unworkable in a particular situation.</p>
<p>When a <a href="#chap83">betrayal by eternalism</a> leaves you <a href="#chap84">feeling sick</a>, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss13')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a> or one of its allied stances may look more attractive. Outright nihilism is <a href="#chap81">nearly impossible to maintain</a>, but you can adopt it transiently. In the longer term, you might commit to some kind of Nihilism Lite, like <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss14" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss14')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>. Materialism (as I use the word in this book) is the stance that eternal purposes are meaningless, but mundane, material ones are real.</p>
<p>With practice, you can learn to avoid both these possibilities. Instead, when you notice you are in the eternalist stance—when you find yourself insisting on a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss15" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss15')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> meaning—you can use that as a reminder to move to the complete stance.</p>

<p>This book aims to provide methods for deliberately moving out of wrong, dysfunctional stances into accurate, functional ones. Mostly, people seem unaware of the dynamics I describe, and so get pushed around helplessly, from one confused stance to the next, when difficulties arise. Instead, you can use moments of breakdown as openings to move on deliberately—ideally, to the complete stance. Troubles with meaning are valuable if you are prepared to transition and know where best to head. That requires understanding how all the stances work: what makes the confused ones attractive, how they inevitably fail, and why the complete stance is better. This takes intellectual understanding, thorough emotional familiarity, and then skill developed through repetitive practice.</p>
<p>Overall, the method could be described as <dfn>destabilizing</dfn> confused stances and <dfn>stabilizing</dfn> the complete stance. </p>
<ul>
<li>Eternalism consists of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss16" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denying', 'gloss16')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.

[Click for details.]">denying</a> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss17" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss17')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>, so learning to recognize nebulosity is the general method for destabilizing the stance.</li>
<li>Since <a href="#chap31">eternalism’s appeal</a> is the promise of <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap34">control</a>, realizing that it cannot deliver those destabilizes it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_jobt19r" id="extra29_footnoteref3_jobt19r" title="Realizing also that limited knowledge, understanding, and control are possible is an antidote to nihilism.">3</a></li>
<li>In the <a href="#chap38">eternalist ploys</a> section, I have also suggested antidotes for many more specific patterns of eternalist thinking, feeling, and action.</li>
<li>Just exiting eternalism is insufficient, though, if that simply drops you into another confused stance. Each needs its own antidotes—discussed later in the book.</li>
<li>The complete stance consists of acknowledging both nebulosity and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss18" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss18')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form.

<p>Non-theistic eternalism has all the same defects as the religious varieties, but this is less well-known, and therefore harder to defend against.

It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a>.</p>
<p>It is easy for atheists to feel smug and superior about our more accurate worldview. Yet we commonly slide into malign non-theistic eternalism, which is just as distorted, and causes just as much trouble, as religion.</p>
<p>It is always tempting to find <em>some</em> ultimate source of meaning. (Especially when it seems the only alternative would be <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.) That temptation leads directly to eternalism, with <a href="#chap37">all the harm that entails</a>.</p>
<p>Belief in the supernatural is harmful, but several modern eternalist systems are thoroughly naturalistic (or pretend to be, anyway). I believe it is not mainly supernaturalism that is harmful about religion, it is eternalism.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>“Reason” was the first substitute proposed for God, back in the European Enlightenment, and it is still the most influential. Reason, after all, led us out of the nightmare of religion. What better to crown as the new ruler? It seems to make sense that the world would make sense—that there is a meaningful <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss4')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> to everything—and that, using rationality, we can discover it.</p>
<p>Clear thinking is always a good thing, but ideological concepts of rationality (or “Reason”) can distort it into an eternalism. Eternalist rationality has most of the same features as religion—the same attractions, harms, ploys, and antidotes. It cannot deliver on its shining promises, because the world <em>doesn’t</em> make complete sense. Reality is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss5')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>. Eternalist rationalism has to lie and cheat to hide that, and so commits violence against accurate perception.</p>
<p>Political ideologies can also substitute for religion. Meaning is mainly a social activity, and political theories claim to provide explanations for social interactions. Political ideologies say what the patterns of society <em>are</em>; what they <em>mean</em>; and what they <em>should be</em>. However, all social interaction is, in reality, nebulous. Therefore, political theories cannot deliver the utopias they promise. Reliably, instead, they deliver oppressive dystopias; sometimes, when taken sufficiently seriously, deliberate multi-megadeath catastrophes. </p>
<p>Among non-theistic eternalisms, I will analyze rationality and political ideology in some detail, running to several web pages each. However, I’ll also devote single pages to briefer coverage of eternalistic psychotherapeutic ideology, non-theistic Buddhist eternalism, and <a href="#chap62">UFO cults</a>.</p>

<p class="intro_para">UFO cults are a great counter-example to the rationalist assumption that religion’s faults stem from supernaturalism. UFO cults have all the same faults as other religions, but make only naturalistic claims. Naturally-occurring space aliens substitute for the gods and demons of supernatural religions.</p>
<p>Of course, these space aliens don’t exist, any more than gods and demons do. But that is exactly the point: the problem with religions is not that they are supernatural, but that they are wrong. And actually even that is not the problem. The problem is that they are <em>harmful</em>, because they are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalistic</a>. UFO cults, and alien abduction beliefs, are just as eternalistic as the big monotheisms; and that is why they mess people up.</p>
<p>Because they are so similar to primitive polytheisms, and so simple and familiar in their beliefs, UFO cults are a great case study in naturalistic eternalism. That makes them a useful background example for more sophisticated non-supernatural eternalisms.</p>
<p>Particularly, I’ll draw an analogy between UFO cults and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitarianism">singularitarianism↗︎︎</a>. In some versions, singularitarianism is closely parallel to Christianity, with the supernatural God replaced with a hypothetical superintelligent computer program. Singularitarianism is a <a href="#chap63">rationalist eternalist</a> religion. It’s much more sophisticated than UFO cults, but structurally similar.</p>
<p>The emotional dynamics of <a href="#chap119">specialness</a> is a central feature of space alien beliefs (and of singularitarianism). Space aliens make contact with only a few humans. Because the aliens are superintelligent, they must have selected them for extremely good reasons. Even though space aliens perform sadistic sexual torture experiments on most contactees, those must have been very special people to have been chosen for the ordeal. Most are otherwise exceptionally <a href="#chap120">ordinary</a> people, with no obvious outstanding qualities. Their selection by UFO aliens validates their existence in a way that nothing else could.</p>
<p>One useful source is Susan A. Clancy’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002WYJICS/?tag=meaningness-20">Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped by Aliens↗︎︎</a>. From a review in <cite>Scientific American</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book explains how individuals can have memories of events that never occurred and describes the types of people who are more likely to become believers. In a nutshell, they are fantasy-prone and are often unhappy and trying to make sense of their lives. The abduction provides a touchstone. At the very end, and with obvious reluctance, Clancy concludes that abduction beliefs provide “the same things that millions of people the world over derive from their religions: meaning, reassurance, mystical revelation, spirituality, transformation.”</p>

<p>Rationality, understood and used properly, is a good thing. In the everyday sense, it is wise to think clearly and to act sensibly. My criticism of rationalist eternalism does not reject reason for emotionalism, or for some sort of anti-rational spirituality. I think anti-rational stances are also wrong and harmful. (I’ll analyze their faults later, in the chapter on <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss3')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

<p>In addition to good common sense, there are technical methods of reasoning that can be importantly useful sometimes. I will criticize their misuse, but I value technical rationality itself.</p>
<p>My argument against eternalist rationality is that reasoning does not, in fact, provide explanations or meanings for everything.

<p>The exaggerated claims of ideological rationality are obviously and undeniably false, and are predictably harmful—just as with all eternalism. Yet they are so attractive—to a certain sort of person—that they are also irresistible.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_three">Rationality and the Big Three stance combinations</h2>
<p>The actual basis for rationalistic distortion is not eternalism. The root distortion is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss5')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a>, as I use the term in this book. Dualism, in this sense, is the insistence on boundaries; that everything must be definitely this or that, and not vaguely in-between.</p>
<p>The methods of rationality require specific categories. If you keep in mind that all categories are partially-arbitrary, artificial constructions, and cannot fully capture reality, the distortions they create may not cause problems. Ideological rationality tries to force reality to fit categories—and that does not end well.</p>
<p>It might make better sense to postpone discussion of rationality into the chapter on dualism. However, ideological rationality is such an important form of eternalism that I want to cover it here.</p>
<p>You may recall that there are <a href="#chap21">three main stance combinations</a>: dualist eternalism, monist eternalism, and dualist nihilism. Monist eternalism is anti-rational, because rationality depends on specifics, and monism denies specifics.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_technical">Methods of rationality</h2>
<p>You may have little interest in the technical methods of rationality, because you believe you understand their limits and faults and harms. You might even be a bit smug about that—but if you don’t understand in detail how formal rationality works, you are probably partly mistaken. You are probably, without knowing it, under the sway of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Romanticism', 'gloss7')" title="Romanticism—in this book—is the view that the True Self is mystically connected with The Entire Universe. The &quot;True Self&quot; is spiritual and emotional and intuitive, so Romanticism is anti-rational. Romanticism is closely related with monism, since it imagines connections that do not actually exist. Unlike monism, however, Romanticism does not deny all differences. Historically, it was primarily an aesthetic movement, based on the idea that ultimate reality expressed itself through the artist's True Self based on their special connection. [Click for details.]">Romanticism</a>—an anti-rational eternalist ideology that is just as bad. Also, you are missing out on a good thing.</p>
<p>The methods of rationality are powerfully useful, and everyone should learn them, I think. As with all power tools, such as chainsaws, you also need to learn suitable safety procedures. The problem with rationality is not that it is technical. The problem is not anything about the methods themselves. The problem is metaphysical claims about the power of the methods to explain the unexplainable.</p>
<p>The pages in this section are somewhat technical. They are meant mainly for those who know at least a little about methods of formal reasoning. My intention is to point out potential dangers (ways rationality can distort into eternalism) and antidotes (ways to avoid sliding toward eternalism, or to escape from it when you find you have fallen in).</p>

<h2 id="extra29_right">Reduction, the right way</h2>
<p>One problem <dfn>reduces</dfn> to another if the second problem is easier, and a solution for the second is most of a solution for the first.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_9thwx24" id="extra29_footnoteref2_9thwx24" title="Here I am using “reduction” as it is used in mathematics, not as it is used in the philosophy of science. The other sense of “reduction” involves explaining a material phenomenon in terms of an understanding about another, “lower level” one. Most scientific reductions are not mathematical ones.">2</a></p>
<p>An informal example: Suppose you want to get from your home in rural California to Athens, Georgia. There are many ways you could do that, some harder than others. Most of this problem can be solved by taking an airplane from San Francisco to Atlanta. This leaves only the easier problems of getting to and from the airports. What’s “reduced” here is the difficulty of the journey.</p>
<p>A more technical example (which you can skip): the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple#Computing_the_least_common_multiple">best way↗︎︎</a> to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to reduce the problem to finding their greatest common denominator. For two numbers <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, LCM(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) = <i>x</i> ⨉ <i>y</i> ÷ GCD(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>). There are efficient ways to find the GCD. There are other ways to find the LCM, but they are less efficient than finding the GCD and multiplying.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_wrong">Reduction, the wrong way</h2>
<p>A <dfn>wrong-way reduction</dfn> transforms an easier problem into a harder one.</p>
<p>An example: Suppose you want to predict the outcome of a sportsball game. One approach would be to try to predict the number of goals that will be scored by each team. Then you could simply compare the two numbers to see which is greater.</p>
<p>This reduction goes the wrong way, because it is much easier to predict who will win the game than to predict exact scores.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_motivation">Metaphysically motivated wrong-way reductions</h2>
<p>Why would anyone make this sort of mistake?</p>
<p>If you wrongly believe that the second problem <em>is</em> easier than the first, this is not a logical fallacy. It’s an honest error of fact.</p>
<p>However, wrong-way reductions are often <em>motivated</em> errors, driven by wrong metaphysical attitudes. Often wrong-way reductions are advocated by people who <em>know</em> that the second problem is harder—or even impossible!</p>
<p>Wrong-way reductions are usually motivated by <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>. Eternalists are unwilling to accept the inherent messiness, ambiguity, and uncertainty of life. Eternalists try to turn messy, ambiguous, and uncertain (but workable) problems into tidy, clear, certain ones—even when those are entirely insoluble.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/divine-c/">Divine command ethics↗︎︎</a> turns the difficult problem of choosing how to act into the impossible problem of knowing God’s will. Ethics gets messy when different ethical considerations point in different directions in a single situation. Then it may appear that God has given contradictory instructions. How then to resolve the ambiguity? Honest theologians admit—when pushed hard enough—that it may be impossible to know what God wants then.</p>
<p>To cope with the cognitive dissonance of relying on the impossible to cope with the merely difficult, eternalists produce evasions, obfuscations, and denials. These boil down to an “if”: <em>if</em> we knew what God wanted, <em>then</em> that would be a simple, infallible guide to correct action. The fact that we <em>don’t</em> know gets passed over quickly, hoping you won’t notice.</p>
<p>This example is slightly contrived, mainly because divine command ethics has so many <em>other</em> defects that knowing God’s will gets barely mentioned in discussions of this ethical approach. I chose it because it’s so simple and so obviously unworkable.</p>
<p>The next several pages explore more sophisticated, non-theistic examples of the same pattern.</p>

<p>Obviously, wrong-way reduction is worse than useless. However, it can be emotionally compelling, as a way to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denial', 'gloss2')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.

Rationalists are particularly averse to mess, and may be willing to overlook the fact that the new tidy problem is provably insoluble.</p>
<p>In religious eternalisms, the ordering principle (often personified as God) is supposed to act autonomously. In that case, one can imagine the principle fulfilling <a href="#chap31">eternalism’s promises</a> of <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap34">control</a> without humans having to do the work. This is not a wrong-way reduction; it “reduces” a hard problem to <a href="#chap48">maintaining faith</a>, which is easier (although ineffective).</p>
<p>In a rationalist eternalism, certainty, understanding, and control must be available to us directly. And so we must be able to get certainty, understanding, control of the principle itself, by rational means. For example, <a href="#chap70">utilitarianism</a> is supposed to deliver certainty, understanding, and control of ethics, through mathematical calculation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the utilitarian calculations are more difficult than effective moral reasoning, so this is a wrong-way reduction. More generally, in other rationalist eternalisms, the problem of accessing the eternal ordering principle is more difficult than solving the practical problems the eternalism is supposed to address. In fact, in each case, it is outright impossible—and <em>has</em> to be.</p>
<p>Rationalist eternalism promises to eliminate nebulosity, so it is attractive when nebulosity is unattractive. However, nebulosity is a brute fact that cannot be eliminated; and so no eternal ordering principle can exist. Rationalist eternalism fails precisely <em>because</em> of its attractive promise.</p>
<p>The rationalist eternalist proposition is: “If we can just eliminate nebulosity using math, then solving the actual problem will be easy, at least in principle.” But mathematics can’t eliminate nebulosity, so this is always a wrong-way reduction.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_marriage">The marriage of empiricism and rationality</h2>
<p>Mainstream epistemology—the theory of how we can know things—has two principles: <dfn>empiricism</dfn> and <dfn>rationality</dfn>. “Empiricism” means that knowledge is based on perception; “rationality” means that knowledge is based on sound reasoning.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, there were believed to be other bases for reliable knowledge: tradition, scripture, and intuition. All five of these competed with each of the others. So rationalists and empiricists were enemies, and it seemed both could not be right. However, in the late 1800s, rationalism and empiricism allied, and killed the other three. The two joined in the holy matrimony of the Scientific Worldview.</p>
<p>This marriage seems happy enough. Indeed, it’s obvious to any working scientist that both are indispensable. It is little-noticed that no contract was drawn up, and the terms of the union are undefined. Perhaps this is a <em>motivated</em> ignorance; why risk upset?</p>
<p>Dropping the flowery metaphors: we have no coherent explanation for how rationality and empiricism relate to each other—even though philosophers have worked hard to find one for several centuries. I find this mysterious and exciting, because I suspect that <em>neither</em> rationality nor empiricism is a good account of knowledge, separately or combined. That opens the possibility for alternative, more accurate explanations.</p>
<p>That is a big topic. This page concentrates on one small aspect: the relationships among mathematical logic, probability theory, and rationality in general. (A terminological point: confusingly, reasoning and empiricism are now often referred to <em>together</em> as “rationality.”) Mathematical logic is the modern, formal version of rationality in the narrow sense, and probability theory is the modern, formal version of empiricism.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that probability theory extends mathematical logic from dealing with just “true” and “false” to a continuous scale of uncertainty. Some have said that this is proven by Cox’s Theorem. These are both misunderstandings, as I’ll explain below. In short: logic is capable of expressing complex relationships among different objects, and probability theory is not.</p>
<p>A more serious corollary misunderstanding is that probability theory is a complete theory of formal rationality; or even of rationality in general; or even of epistemology.</p>
<p>In fact, logic can do things probability theory can’t. However, despite much hard work, no known formalism completely unifies the two! Even at the mathematical level, the marriage of rationality and empiricism has never been fully consummated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, probability theory <em>plus</em> logic cannot exhaust rationality—much less add up to a complete epistemology. I’ll end with a <em>very</em> handwavey sketch of how we might make progress toward one.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_plan">Plan</h2>
<p>I hope to dispel misunderstandings by comparing the <dfn>expressive power</dfn> of three formal systems. In reverse order:</p>
<ul>
<li><dfn>Predicate calculus</dfn>—the usual meaning of “logic”—can describe relationships among multiple objects.</li>
<li><dfn>Aristotelian logic</dfn> can describe only the properties of a single object.</li>
<li><dfn>Propositional calculus</dfn> cannot talk about objects at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probability theory can be viewed as an extension of propositional calculus. Propositional calculus is described as “a logic,” for historical reasons, but it is not what is usually meant by “logic.”</p>
<p>Cox’s Theorem concerns only propositional calculus. Further, it was well-known long before Cox that probability theory does extend propositional calculus.</p>
<p>Informally, probability theory can extend Aristotelian logic as well. This is usually unproblematic in practice, although it squicks logicians a bit.</p>
<p>Probability theory by itself cannot express relationships among multiple objects, as predicate calculus (i.e. “logic”) can. The two systems are typically combined in scientific practice. In specific cases, this is intuitive and unproblematic. In general, it is difficult and an open research area.</p>
<p>These misunderstandings probably originate with E. T. Jaynes. More about that toward the end of this page.</p>
<p>“Expressive power” is about what a system allows you to say. A possible objection to probability theory as an account of rationality is that it is too expensive to compute with. This essay is not about that problem. Even if all computation were free, probability theory could not reason about relationships, because it can’t even represent them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_1ox9661" id="extra29_footnoteref1_1ox9661" title="Predicate calculus is still more computationally expensive; in fact, it is provably arbitrarily expensive. I’m not advocating it as a general engineering approach to rationality either.">1</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_propositional">Propositional calculus</h2>
<p><dfn>Propositional calculus</dfn> is the mathematics of “and,” “or,” and “not.” (“Calculus” here has nothing to do with the common meaning of “calculus” as the mathematics of continuous change: derivatives and integrals.) There is not much to say about “and,” “or,” and “not,” and not much you can do with them. (You can <a href="#extra29_logic">skip to the next section</a> if you know this stuff.)</p>
<p>A “proposition,” for propositional calculus, is something that is either true or false. As far as this system is concerned, there is nothing more to a proposition than that. Particularly, propositional calculus is never concerned with what a proposition is <em>about</em>. It is only concerned with what happens when you combine propositions with “and,” “or,” and “not.” It symbolizes these three with ∧, ∨, and ¬, respectively.</p>
<p>So let’s consider some particular proposition, which we’ll call p. All we can say about it is that it is either true or false. Regarding ¬, we can say that if p is true, then ¬p is false. Also, if p is false, then ¬p is true. Thus endeth the disquisition upon negation. (Perhaps you are not enthralled so far.)</p>
<p>Consider two propositions, p and q. If both p and q are true, then p∧q is true. If either of them is false, then p∧q is false. (Surprised?) That’s all that can be said about ∧.</p>
<p>You’ll be shocked to learn that if either p or q is true, then p∨q is true; but if both of them are false, then p∨q is false.</p>
<p>From these profound insights, we can prove some important theorems. For example, it can be shown that p∧¬p is false, regardless of whether p is true or false. (You may wish to check this carefully.)</p>
<p>Likewise, it can be shown that p∨¬p is true, regardless of whether p is true or false. In other exciting news, it turns out that p∧p is true if p is true, and false if not. Moreover, p∧q is true if, and only if, q∧p is true!</p>
<p>There are a half dozen banalities of this sort in total; and they exhaust the expressive power of propositional calculus.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_logic">Propositional calculus and “logic”</h2>
<p>Propositional calculus is extremely important; it’s the rock bottom foundation for all of mathematics. But by itself, it’s also extremely weak. It’s useful to understand only for its role in more powerful systems.</p>
<p>Propositional calculus can’t <em>talk about</em> anything. As far as it knows, propositions are just true or false; they have no meaning beyond that.</p>
<p>The grade school example of logic is this <dfn>syllogism</dfn>:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>(a) All men are mortal.</p>
<p>(b) Socrates is a man.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>(c) Socrates is mortal.</p>
</div>
<p>We can capture the “therefore” in propositional calculus.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_p117yne" id="extra29_footnoteref2_p117yne" title="Or maybe not. Since propositional calculus does not let you talk about anything, its “therefore” really isn’t the same as a common-sense “therefore.” Some people think this is important, but it’s not relevant to this essay, so let’s move on.">2</a> Its symbol is →. It turns out that p→q is equivalent to (¬p)∨q. (You may need to think that through if you aren’t familiar with it. Consider each of the cases of p and q being true and false. If p is true, then ¬p is false, so q has to be true to make (¬p)∨q true. If p isn’t true, then ¬p is true, and then it doesn’t matter whether q is true or false.)</p>
<p>So we could try to write the syllogism, in propositional calculus, as (a∧b)→c. But this is not a valid deduction in propositional calculus. As far as it knows, a, b, and c are all independent, because it has no idea what any of them mean. The fact that a and b are both about men, and b and c are both about Socrates, is beyond the system’s ken.</p>
<p>For this calculus, propositions are “atomic” or “opaque.” You aren’t allowed to look at their internal structure. Propositional calculus has no numbers; no individuals, no properties, no relationships; nothing except true, false, and, or, and not. Most important, it has no way of reasoning from generalizations (“all men are mortal”) to specifics (“Socrates is mortal”).<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_l8i0aj3" id="extra29_footnoteref3_l8i0aj3" title="E. T. Jaynes did not understand this. He was badly confused here already. He failed to understand the relationship between propositional and Aristotelian logic, much less the more complicated relationship between Aristotelian and predicate logic. In Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, p. 4, he claims to explain what a syllogism is, but his explanation is actually of modus ponens! Modus ponens is an operation of propositional logic, whereas the syllogism requires Aristotelian logic, i.e. a single universal quantifier. Jaynes did not see the distinction between the two; a very basic error.">3</a></p>
<p>For historical reasons, propositional calculus is described as “a logic,” and is sometimes called “propositional logic.” But it is not what mathematicians or philosophers mean when they talk about “logic.” They mean predicate calculus, a different and immensely more powerful system.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_probability">Probability theory extends propositional calculus</h2>
<p>Probability theory can easily be seen as an extension of propositional calculus to deal with uncertainty. In fact, the axiomatic foundations of the two were developed in concert, in the mid–1800s, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">Boole↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Venn">Venn↗︎︎</a> among others. It was obvious then that the two are closely linked.</p>
<p>This section sketches the way probability theory extends propositional calculus, in case you are unfamiliar with the point. You can <a href="#extra29_cox">skip ahead</a> if you already know this.</p>
<p>Probabilities are numbers from 0 to 1, where 1 means “certainly yes,” 0 means “certainly no,” and numbers in between represent degrees of uncertainty. When probability theory is applied in the real world, probabilities are assigned to various sorts of things, like hypotheses and events; but the math doesn’t specify that. As far as the math is concerned, there are just various thingies that have probabilities, and it has nothing to say about the thingies themselves. Just as in propositional calculus, probability theory doesn’t let you “look inside” them. In fact, one common way of applying probability theory is to say that the thingies are, indeed, propositions.</p>
<p>An event is something that either happens, or doesn’t. If e is an event, we symbolize its probability as P(e). We can symbolize the other possibility—that e doesn’t happen—as ¬e. It is certain that either e or ¬e will happen, so P(e) + P(¬e) = 1. Rearranging, P(¬e) = 1 – P(e). If e is certain, then P(e) = 1, so P(¬e) = 0, i.e. certainly false.</p>
<p>Suppose f is another event, which can happen only if e doesn’t happen. For example, if e is a die coming up 3, and f is the die coming up 4, then they are mutually exclusive. In that case, P(e∨f), the probability that the die comes up either 3 or 4, is P(e)+P(f). (For a six-sided die, that is 1/6+1/6=1/3.)</p>
<p>Suppose two events are “independent”: approximately, there is no causal connection between them. For example, two dice rolling should not affect each other. Let’s say e is the first die coming up 3, and g is the second one coming up 3. In that case, the probability that they will both come up 3, P(e∧g) = P(e) × P(g), which is 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_tfjrwbd" id="extra29_footnoteref4_tfjrwbd" title="If the events are not independent, it’s still possible to calculate probabilities, but more complicated.">4</a></p>
<p>What is the probability that <em>at least one</em> die comes up 3? These are not mutually exclusive, so it is not simply the sum. It is P(e∨g) = P(e) + P(g) – P(e∧g), or 1/3 – 1/36. “At least one” includes “both,” and we have to subtract that out.</p>
<p>So, taken together, we see a simple and intuitive connection between probability and the operations of propositional calculus.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_cox">Cox’s Theorem</h2>
<p>Cox’s Theorem concerns this relationship between propositional calculus and probability theory. It is irrelevant to the question “does probability theory extend logic” because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Propositional calculus is not “logic” as that is usually understood.</li>
<li>It was well-known for decades before Cox that probability theory does extend propositional calculus.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_9sfo0pg" id="extra29_footnoteref5_9sfo0pg" title="In fact, Cox pointed this out in his 1961 book The Algebra of Probable Inference, quoting Boole in Footnote 5, p. 101. In this passage, Boole not only makes the connection between the frequentist and logical interpretations of probability, he suggests that it is necessary—which is the point of Cox’s Theorem.">5</a></li>
</ol>
<p>So you can probably just <a href="#extra29_using">skip the rest</a> of this section. However, since some people have misunderstood Cox’s Theorem as proving that probability theory includes all of logic, and is therefore a complete theory of rationality, I’ll say a little more about it.</p>
<p>Cox’s Theorem was an attempt to answer the informal question: Is there something <em>like</em> probability theory, but not quite the same?</p>
<p>This sort of question is often paradigm-breaking in mathematics. Is there something like Euclid’s geometry, but not quite the same? Yes, there are non-Euclidian geometries; and they turn out to be the mathematical key to Einsteinian relativity. Are there things that are like real numbers but not quite the same? Yes; complex numbers, for example, which have endless applications in pure mathematics, physics, and engineering.</p>
<p>So if there were something like probability theory, but not the same, we’d want to know about it. It might be extremely useful, in unexpected ways. Or, it might just be a mathematical curiosity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if we knew that there is nothing similar to probability theory, then we’d have more confidence that using it is justified. We know probability theory often gives good results; if there’s nothing else like it, then we don’t have to worry that some other method would give better ones.</p>
<p>To answer the question, we need to say precisely what “like” would mean. (Probate law is “like” probability theory in some ways, but not ones we care about.) One approach is to define “what probability theory is like”; and then we can ask “are there other things that are like that?” So, what properties of probability theory are important enough that anything “like” it ought to have them?</p>
<p>This is not a mathematical question; it’s just a matter of opinion. Different people have different, reasonable opinions about what’s important about probability theory. The answer to “is there anything else like probability theory?” comes out differently depending on what properties you think something else would have to have to count as “like.”</p>
<p>When Cox was writing, in the 1940s, definitely nothing “like” probability theory was known. So he wanted to prove that indeed this would remain true.</p>
<p>Probably everyone would agree that anything “like” probability theory has to be a method for reasoning about uncertainty. So Cox started by asking: what would everyone intuitively agree has to be true about any sane method? For one thing, everyone would agree that in cases of certainty, any method ought to accord with propositional calculus; and that in cases of near-certainty, it ought to nearly accord. So, for instance, if q is nearly certain, then q∨p should also be nearly certain.</p>
<p>So Cox’s plan was to start with a handful of such intuitions, and show that probability theory is the only system that satisfies them. And, he thought he had done that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are technical, philosophical, and practical problems with his result. I will mention some of these, but only briefly—because the whole topic is irrelevant to my point.</p>
<p>Technically, Cox’s proof was simply wrong, and the “Theorem” as stated is not true. Various technical fixes have been proposed, yielding revised, accurate theorems with similar content.</p>
<p>Philosophically, it is unclear that all his requirements were intuitive. For example, the proof requires negation to be a twice-differentiable function. Some authors do not consider twice-differentiability an “intuitive” property of negation; others do.</p>
<p>It is also controversial what the (fixed-up) mathematical result means philosophically. Whereas in 1946, when Cox published his Theorem, there clearly was nothing else like probability theory, there are now a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecise_probability">related mathematical systems↗︎︎</a> for reasoning about uncertainty.</p>
<p>These share a common motivation. Probability theory doesn’t work when you have inadequate information. Implicitly, it demands that you always have complete confidence in your probability estimate,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_ajfly1u" id="extra29_footnoteref6_ajfly1u" title="In the Bayesian interpretation, anyway.">6</a> like maybe 0.5279371, whereas in fact often you just have no clue. Or you might say “well, it seems the probability is at least 0.3, and not more than 0.8, but any guess more definite than that would be meaningless.”</p>
<p>So various systems try to capture this intuition: sometimes a specific numerical probability is unavailable, but you can still do some reasoning anyway. These systems coincide with probability theory in cases where you are confident of your probability estimate, and extend it to handle cases where you aren’t.</p>
<p>Some advocates of probability theory point to Cox’s Theorem as reason to dismiss alternatives. Is that justified? It is not a <em>mathematical</em> reason; the alternatives are valid as mathematical systems. It’s a <em>philosophical</em> claim that depends on intuitions that reasonable people disagree about.</p>
<p>Practically, what we want to know is: are there times when we should use one of the alternatives, instead of probability theory?</p>
<p>This is an empirical, engineering question, not a mathematical one. I have no expertise in this area, but from casual reading, the answer seems to be “no.” Successful applications seem to be rare or non-existent. When probability theory doesn’t work, the other leading brands don’t work either. They just add complexity.</p>
<p>So in a practical sense, I think Cox was probably right. As far as we know, there’s nothing similar to probability theory that’s also useful in practice.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_ky6d3xb" id="extra29_footnoteref7_ky6d3xb" title="An important exception is quantum mechanics, which can be seen as an extension of probability theory in which probabilities can be negative or complex numbers. (Thanks to John Costello (@joxn) for pointing this out.) It is not “like” probability theory in Cox’s sense, and not useful as a way of reasoning about macroscopic uncertainty, but is of great practical (engineering) and theoretical (physics) importance.">7</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_using">Using probability in the real world</h2>
<p>Probability theory is just math; but we care about it because it’s useful when applied to real-world problems. Originally, for example, it was developed to analyze gambling games.</p>
<p>Suppose you roll a die, and you believe it is fair. Then you believe that the probability it will come up as a three is 1/6. You could write this as P(3) = 1/6.</p>
<p>People write things like that all the time, and it is totally legitimate. It might make you slightly uneasy, however. 3 is a number. It’s abstract. Do numbers have probabilities? Not as such. You <em>assign</em> 3 a probability, in this particular context. In a different context—for example, rolling an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005EFVZUK/?tag=meaningness-20">icosahedral die↗︎︎</a>—it would have a different probability.</p>
<p>There is always a process of intelligent interpretation between a mathematical statement and the real world. This interpretation gives mathematics “aboutness.” What, in the real world, do the mathematical entities refer to? Here, you understand that “3” corresponds to whether a die has come up three or not. </p>
<p>This interpretation is not merely mental; it is a bodily process of action and perception. You have learned to roll a die in a way that makes its outcome sufficiently random<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_6xlm3nk" id="extra29_footnoteref8_6xlm3nk" title="This might seem obvious, but small children can’t do it reliably.">8</a>; and you can
count the number of pips on a die face.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_079zx6r" id="extra29_footnoteref9_079zx6r" title="Or, more accurately, you can subitize them.">9</a> The usefulness of any mathematics depends on such interpretive processes working reliably.</p>
<p>“3” is ambiguous, as we saw. In this simple case, <em>you</em> know what it refers to, and won’t get confused. But someone else might read your observation that “P(3) = 1/6” and try to apply it to an icosahedral die; in which case they might make bad bets. So when communicating with others, or in more complicated cases where you might lose track yourself, you would want to be more explicit. </p>
<p>What exactly <em>did</em> “P(3) = 1/6” mean? Maybe it’s “this particular die, now rolling, has probability 1/6 of coming up with a three.” Or maybe you have a more general belief: “any fair six-sided die has probability 1/6 of coming up three any time it is rolled.” So then, to avoid ambiguity, you could write:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(any fair six-sided die coming up three any time it is rolled) = 1/6</p>
</div>
<p>This has a high ratio of English to math, however. English is notoriously ambiguous. Quite possibly there’s still room for misinterpretation. It might be better to write this in a way that is purely mathematical, so there’s no ambiguity left.</p>
<p>Modern mathematical logic was developed as a way to do exactly that. Logicians wanted a systematic way of turning English statements into unambiguous mathematical ones. The system they invented is called predicate calculus.</p>
<p>It is now <em>the meta-language of mathematics</em>. All math can (in principle) be expressed in predicate calculus. It is immensely more powerful than propositional calculus. Its key trick—which is necessary to express generalizations like “any six-sided die”—is called <dfn>logical quantification</dfn>.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, let’s look at a simpler system, Aristotelian logic; and look at how probability theory can more-or-less handle Aristotelian generalization.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_implicit">Implicit generalizations</h2>
<p>Aristotelian logic allows us to make general statements about the properties of particular, single objects. The standard example is “all men are mortal.” The Aristotelian syllogism allows us to reason from general to specific statements. For example, if we know that Socrates is a specific man, then we can conclude that Socrates is mortal.</p>
<p>How does this relate to probability theory? “All men are mortal” is usually considered certain, so it’s not a good example for answering that.</p>
<p>Instead: the logician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll">C. L. Dodgson↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_of_the_Snark">demonstrated↗︎︎</a> that some snarks—not all—are boojums. A probabilist may write this generalization as a <dfn>conditional probability</dfn>:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(boojum|snark) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical bar | is read “given”. The statement is understood as something like “if you see a snark, the probability that it is a boojum is 0.4.” Or, “the probability of boojumness given snarkness is 0.4.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians would call this “an abuse of notation”; but if it is interpreted intelligently in context, it’s unproblematic. Still, it’s rather queer. What exactly are “snark” and “boojum” supposed to mean here?</p>
<p>A probability textbook will tell you that the things that get probabilities are events or hypotheses or outcomes or propositions. (Different authors disagree.) We could legitimately say</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(Edward is a boojum|Edward is a snark) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>because “Edward is a snark” is a proposition. But this is a specific fact, and we want to express a generalization about snarks broadly.</p>
<p>“Snark” and “boojum” refer to categories, or properties; and those don’t get probabilities. In this context, they are meant to be read as something like “this thing is a snark” (or boojum). A more pedantically correct statement would be:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(it is a boojum|something is a snark) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>But again this doesn’t look like math; and what does “this” mean?<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_pi0nba9" id="extra29_footnoteref10_pi0nba9" title="Technically, “this” is an indexical. Mid–20th-century logicians realized that indexicals allow for implicit universal quantification—when combined with some method for instantiating, or determining the reference of, each indexical. They didn’t have much of a story about the method. One of the central innovations of the Pengi system I built with Phil Agre was using (simulated) machine vision to bind indexicals to real-world objects.">10</a> How are we sure that the “something” that is a snark refers to the same thing as the “it” that might be a boojum? Someone might read this, observe that Carlotta is a snark, and conclude that there’s a 0.4 probability that Edward is a boojum. That is not a deduction the equation was supposed to allow. We’re depending on intelligent interpretation. We’ll see that this could become arbitrarily difficult, and therefore unreliable, in more complex cases.</p>
<p>Formally, a <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network">Bayesian network↗︎︎</a></dfn> is a set of specific conditional probabilities. In practice, by abuse of notation and intelligent application, it is used to express a set of generalizations. For example:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(snark|hairy) = 0.01</p>
<p>P(boojum|snark) = 0.4</p>
<p>P(lethal|boojum) = 0.9
</p></div>
<p>Implicitly, “hairy,” “snark,” “boojum,” and “lethal” are all meant to refer to <em>the same creature</em>—whichever that happens to be in the situation at hand.</p>
<p>So long as this implicit reference works out, probability theory can <em>in practice</em> capture Aristotelian logic: generalizations about properties of a single object.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_bsmijzj" id="extra29_footnoteref11_bsmijzj" title="Technically, this is not exactly what “Aristotelian logic” means; I’m skipping some fiddly details that are only of historical interest, and not relevant to this discussion.">11</a> Mathematical formulations of probability theory don’t support that, but there’s usually no practical problem. </p>
<p>However, Aristotelian logic is weak; it doesn’t let you talk about relationships among objects. Let’s shine some light on an example.</p>
<p>There’s other scary monsters out there. Grues, for example. If you explore a cave in the dark, you are likely to be eaten by one.</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(grue|cave) = 0.7</p>
<p>P(grue|dark) = 0.8</p>
<p>P(eaten|grue) = 0.9
</p></div>
<p>This example is different. “Cave” does not refer to the same thing as “grue”! Again, with intelligent interpretation, this may not be a problem. The statements were intended to mean something like:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(there is some grue nearby|I am in cave) = 0.7</p>
<p>P(there is some grue nearby|the cave is dark) = 0.8</p>
<p>P(that nearby grue will eat me|there is a grue nearby) = 0.9
</p></div>
<p>English is carrying too much of the load here, however. It’s <em>someone’s</em> job to keep track of grues and caves and “I”s and make sure they are all in the right relationships. The conditional probability formalism is not able to do that.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_77kz6bn" id="extra29_footnoteref12_77kz6bn" title="Here “I” and “that” are indexicals, which give implicit quantification, but “some” is an explicit quantifier. An explicit formalization of this situation requires nested quantification, and you can’t get that with just indexicals, even implicitly.">12</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_quantification">Logical quantification</h2>
<p>Predicate calculus has an elegant, general way of talking about relationships: <dfn>logical quantifiers</dfn>. They are the solution here.</p>
<p>A simplest use cleans up the vagueness of “P(boojum|snark) = 0.4.” We’re supposed to interpret that as: <em>anything</em> that is a snark has probability 0.4 of being a boojum. In predicate calculus,</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∀x: P(boojum(x)|snark(x)) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>“∀” is read “for all,” and the thing that comes after it is a place holder variable that could stand for anything. So this means “for anything at all—call it x—the probability that x is a boojum, given that x is snark, is 0.4.”</p>
<p>So ∀ is doing two pieces of work for us. One is that it lets us make an <em>explicitly</em> general statement. “P(boojum|snark) = 0.4” was implicitly meant to apply to all monsters, but that worked only “by abuse of notation”; you can’t actually do that in formal probability theory.</p>
<p>∀’s second trick is to allow us to reason from generalities to specifics—the Aristotelian syllogism. This is done by “binding” the variable x to a particular value, such as Edward. From </p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∀x: P(boojum(x)|snark(x)) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>we are allowed to logically deduce </p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(boojum(Edward)|snark(Edward)) = 0.4</p>
</div>
<p>(This operation is called “instantiation” of the general statement.)</p>
<p>There are two logical quantifiers, ∀ and ∃. The second one gets read “there exists.” For example,</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∃x: father(x, Edward)</p>
</div>
<p>“There exists some x such that x is Edward’s father”—or, more naturally, “Something is Edward’s father,” or “Edward has a father.”</p>
<p>The power of predicate calculus comes when we combine two or more quantifiers in a single statement, one nested inside another.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_x7e6itt" id="extra29_footnoteref13_x7e6itt" title="An accurate account of nested quantification was the key to modern logic. It was developed by Gottlob Frege. To quote Wikipedia: “In effect, Frege invented axiomatic predicate logic, in large part thanks to his invention of quantified variables, which eventually became ubiquitous in mathematics and logic, and which solved the problem of multiple generality. Previous logic had dealt with the logical constants and, or, not, and some and all, but iterations of these operations, especially ‘some’ and ‘all’, were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like ‘every boy loves some girl’ and ‘some girl is loved by every boy’ could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege’s formalism had no difficulty… A frequently noted example is that that Aristotle’s logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like Euclid’s theorem, a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Frege’s ‘conceptual notation’ however can represent such inferences.”">13</a> Because each quantifier has its own variable, we can use them to <em>relate</em> two or more things.</p>
<p>Fatherhood is a relationship. Every vertebrate has a father.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_5zm5lp8" id="extra29_footnoteref14_5zm5lp8" title="Let’s simplify this to natural, biological fatherhood, ignoring issues of legal parenthood and laboratory genetic manipulation.">14</a></p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∀x: vertebrate(x) → (∃y: father(y, x))</p>
</div>
<p>From this, if we also know that Edward is a vertebrate, we can deduce that he has a father.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_nzjgsn0" id="extra29_footnoteref15_nzjgsn0" title="Formally, we bind x to Edward and instantiate to get vertebrate(Edward) → (∃y: father(y, Edward)), and then apply modus ponens (implication elimination) to get ∃y: father(y, Edward).">15</a></p>
<p>Probably, every vertebrate has exactly one father:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∀x: vertebrate(x) → (∃y: father(y, x) ∧ (∀z: father(z, x) → z=y))</p>
</div>
<p>“If x is a vertebrate, then it has some father (y), and if anything (z) is x’s father, it’s actually just y.”</p>
<p>Do you believe that? I was sure of it until I thought a bit. If two sperm fertilize an egg at almost the same instant, maybe it’s possible (if very unlikely) that during the first mitosis, the excess paternal chromosomes will get randomly dumped, leaving daughter cells with a normal karyotype composed of a mixture of chromosomes from the two fathers. For all I know, this does happen occasionally in fish or something. Or maybe it just can’t happen, because vertebrate eggs have a reliable mechanism to detect a wrong karyotype, and abort.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_ap4mzh4" id="extra29_footnoteref16_ap4mzh4" title="A few months after writing this, I learned about Tremblay’s salamander, an all-female species with no fathers.

<p>P(father(Arthur, Edward) | experiment) = 0.99</p>
<p>P(father(Harold, Edward) | experiment) = 0.99</p>
<p>P(Arthur = Harold | observations) = 0.01
</p></div>
<p>This should update our belief that every vertebrate has only one father. How?</p>
<p>Here we would be reasoning from specifics to generalities (whereas the implicit instantiation trick of Bayesian networks allows us to reason from generalities to specifics). This is outside the scope of probability theory.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference">Statistical inference↗︎︎</a> is based on probability theory, and enables reasoning from specifics to generalities in some cases. It is not <em>just</em> probability theory, though; and it handles only simple, restricted cases; and it doesn’t relate to predicate calculus in any straightforward way.</p>
<p>Back to the cave:</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>∀x: ∀y: P(∃z: grue(z) ∧ near(z,x) | person(x) ∧ cave(y) ∧ in(x, y)) = 0.8</p>
</div>
<p>“If a person (x) is in a cave (y), then the probability that there’s a grue (z) near the person is 0.8.” Most of what is going on this statement is predicate logic, not probability. Remember that for probability theory, propositions are opaque and atomic. As far as it is concerned, “person(x) ∧ cave(y) ∧ in(x, y)” is just a long name for an event that is either observed or not; and so likewise “∃z: grue(z) ∧ near(z,x).” It can’t “look inside” to see that we’re talking about three different things and their relationships.</p>
<p>In practice, probability theory is often combined with other mathematical methods (such as predicate logic in this case). Probabilists mostly don’t even notice they are doing this. When they use logic, they do so informally and intuitively.</p>
<p>The danger is that they imagine probability theory is doing the work, when in fact something else is doing the heavy lifting. This can lead to logical errors. That is common in scientific practice: the probabilistic part of the reasoning is carried out correctly, but it is “misapplied.” In routine science, “probabilistic reasoning” is usually “we ran this statistics program.” “Misapplied” means that the program was run correctly, but due to a <em>logical</em> error, the results don’t imply what the users thought.</p>
<p>Another danger is sometimes-dramatic over-estimation of what probability theory is capable of. The mistaken idea that “probability theory generalizes logic”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_y83odna" id="extra29_footnoteref17_y83odna" title="It’s worth noting that whereas most of what you can do with logic, you can’t do with probability theory, everything you can do with probability theory, you can do with predicate calculus.

More importantly, it has also warped some accounts of the philosophy of science.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_probabilisticlogic">Probabilistic logic</h3>
<p>Probability theory can’t help you reason about relationships, and that is certainly an important part of rationality. So, probability theory is not a complete theory of rationality—one of the main points of this essay.</p>
<p>Predicate calculus <em>can</em> help you reason about relationships; but by itself, it can’t help you reason about evidence. Probability, in the Bayesian interpretation, is a theory of evidence. Can we combine them to get a complete theory of rationality?</p>
<p>“∀x: P(boojum(x)|snark(x)) = 0.4” is a statement of predicate calculus—not probability theory. As written, it is either true or false. But, maybe you aren’t sure which! In that case, you may have a probability estimate for it. And you might want to update your probability estimate given evidence.</p>
<div class="mathindent">
<p>P(∀x: P(boojum(x)|snark(x)) = 0.4 | snark(Edward)∧boojum(Edward)) = 0.8</p>
</div>
<p>“Given the observations that Edward is both a snark and a boojum, I now think it’s 0.8 probable that the statement ‘the probability that any snark is a boojum is 0.4’ is true.”</p>
<p>What exactly would that mean? How would you use it? What would that say about the probability of a particular snark being a boojum? What happens in the 0.2 probability that the statement is not true? In that case, what does it say about the probability of a particular snark being a boojum? Suppose the probability is actually 0.400001, not 0.4? Does that make the statement false?</p>
<p>The formula freely mixes probability theory with predicate calculus, nesting them any-which-way. There’s a P inside the scope of a ∀ inside the scope of a P. How does that work?</p>
<p>It turns out that, in general, no one yet has an answer to this. The field of <dfn><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-probability/">probabilistic logic↗︎︎</a></dfn> concerns the question. So far, various restricted probabilistic logics have been studied, which do <em>not</em> allow freely mixing probabilities and logical quantifiers. Even these restricted versions can get extremely complicated, and a general theory is <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/ipmu14-oupm.pdf">currently out of reach↗︎︎</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_gd1it1q" id="extra29_footnoteref18_gd1it1q" title="I find this somewhat surprising, actually, and have been tempted to dive in and see if I can solve the problem. But, looking at some examples of reasoning about probabilities of probabilities helps one see, quite quickly, why this is hard. It’s difficult to know what they mean. Interestingly, Jaynes worked on this, developing a formalism he called Ap, which I’ve discussed elsewhere. Ap handles only the very simplest cases (and is probably unworkable in practice for even those), but it does give some insight.">18</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_formal">Formal systems, rationality, and epistemology</h2>
<p>Even if we could fully integrate probability theory and predicate calculus, together they would be far from a complete theory of rationality. They have no account of what the various bits of notation <em>mean</em>, and where they <em>come from</em>. What is “father,” and how did you come up with the idea that ∀x: vertebrate(x) → (∃y: father(y, x)) even <em>might</em> be true?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">Logical positivism↗︎︎</a> was the dream that by writing things out precisely enough, in enough detail, we could get answers to such questions. It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism#Retrospect">conclusively failed↗︎︎</a>. The problem is that formalism <em>necessarily</em> depends on intelligent interpretation-in-action to connect it with the real world; to give it “aboutness.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote19_67od18o" id="extra29_footnoteref19_67od18o" title="Wittgenstein, who was partly responsible for logical positivism in the first place, diagnosed this failure clearly in his Philosophical Investigations. Heidegger presented much the same insight earlier in Being and Time, although not as clearly, and not with reference to logical positivism specifically.">19</a></p>
<p>Formal systems (such as logic and probability theory) are also only useful <em>once you have a model</em>. Where do those come from? I think it’s important to go about finding models in a rational way—but formal rationality has nothing to offer. (I wrote about this in “<a href="#extra9">How to think real good</a>.”)</p>
<p>As a further point, a complete theory of rationality—if such a thing were possible—would probably not be a complete theory of epistemology. We have very little idea what a good epistemological theory might look like, but my guess is that rationality (even in the broadest sense) would be only a small part.</p>
<p>Since we <em>don’t</em> know how people know things (the subject of epistemology), we should try to find out—empirically, and rationally! Armchair speculation has been seriously misleading. (Basing epistemology on an over-simplified fairy-tale version of Newton’s discovery of gravitation—a popular starting point—is not an empirical or rational approach, and reliably fails.) We need to actually <em>observe</em> people using knowledge, finding knowledge, creating knowledge. Only after much observation could we develop and test hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the “social studies of science” research program began to do this. Unfortunately, much of that was postmodern nonsense. It was marred by metaphysical and political axes that many of its practitioners wanted to grind, plus lack of understanding of the subject matter in most cases. This led to the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_wars">Science Wars↗︎︎</a>” of the 1990s, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair">Sokal hoax↗︎︎</a>, which pretty nearly killed off the field.</p>
<p>But this program did some valuable observational work, and made some interesting preliminary hypotheses. I’d like to see a return to careful observational study of how science (and other knowledge-generating activities) are done—this time without the ideological baggage.</p>
<p>Here’s one valuable generalization that came out of “social studies of science.” As I pointed out earlier, mathematical formulae are only given “aboutness” by people’s skilled, interpretive application in practical activity. The same is true of knowledge in general!</p>
<p>Further, most human activity is collaborative. It turns out that sometimes what I know cannot be separated from <em>other people’s</em> ability to make sense of it in relationship with particular situations. Making sense of knowing requires an account of the <dfn>division of epistemic labor</dfn>. Knowledge is often not a property of isolated individuals.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote20_q8gjd42" id="extra29_footnoteref20_q8gjd42" title="This means that the representational theory of mind, which descends from logical positivism, is unworkable. See “A billion tiny spooks.”">20</a></p>
<p>Taking these points seriously leads to radical revisions not only in the sorts of explanations that could plausibly be part of an adequate epistemology, but also in the sorts of things it would need to explain.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_confusion">Historical appendix: Where did the confusion come from?</h2>
<p>E. T. Jaynes’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521592712/?tag=meaningness-20">Probability Theory: The Logic of Science↗︎︎</a> appears to be the root source. He was completely confused about the relationship between probability theory and logic.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote21_q9ihdem" id="extra29_footnoteref21_q9ihdem" title="He was heavily influenced by Cox’s work, which he entirely misunderstood. Cox was definitely not confused, and not to blame; he was explicit that he was discussing only the propositional calculus. Cox’s writing is delightfully informal; if you already know logic, his book is enormously entertaining. If you don’t know logic, the informality is liable to mislead you.">21</a> There’s strong evidence that when people tried to de-confuse him, he pig-headedly refused to listen.</p>
<p>He wrote that probability theory forms the “uniquely valid principles of logic in general” (p. xx); and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our theme is simply: <em>Probability Theory as Extended Logic</em>. The new perception amounts to the recognition that the mathematical rules of probability theory are not merely rules for calculating frequencies of “random variables”; they are also the unique consistent rules for conducting inference (i.e. plausible reasoning) of any kind. (p. xxii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simply false, as I’ve explained in this essay. How did he go wrong?</p>
<p>He got confused by the word “Aristotelian”—or more exactly by the word “non-Aristotelian.”</p>
<p>Aristotelian logic has two <dfn>truth values,</dfn> namely “true” and “false.” In the 1930s, there was a vogue for “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_logic">non-Aristotelian logic↗︎︎</a>,” which added other truth values. For example, a statement could be “meaningless” rather than either true or false. Non-Aristotelian logic turned out to be a dead end, and is a mostly-forgotten historical curiosity.</p>
<p>Predicate calculus is not Aristotelian logic, but it is not “non-Aristotelian”, either! It has only two truth values.</p>
<p>What’s confusing is that Aristotelian logic was extended in two different dimensions: by adding truth values (to produce non-Aristotelian logic) and by allowing nested quantifiers (to produce predicate calculus).</p>
<p>When someone tried to explain to Jaynes that probability theory only extends Aristotelian logic, not predicate calculus, he remembered the phrase “non-Aristotelian logic” and read about that, and (rightly) concluded it was irrelevant to his project. Then when the someone said “no, you missed the point, what matters is predicate calculus,” Jaynes just dug in his heels and refused to take that seriously.</p>
<p>There are several places in his book where he says this explicitly. There’s a long discussion in the section titled “Nitpicking” (p. 23). It’s an amazing expression of defiantly obstinate confusion. Well worth examining to learn linguistic signs that you are refusing to see the obvious: out of arrogance, or because you half-realize that accepting it would collapse your grandiose Theory Of Everything.</p>
<p>There’s another refusal on page xxviii:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although our concern with the nature of logical inference leads us to discuss many of the same issues, our language differs greatly from the stilted jargon of logicians and philosophers. There are no linguistic tricks and there is no “meta-language” gobbledygook; only plain English. … No further clarity would be achieved … with ‘What do you mean by “exists”?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predicate calculus is the standard “meta-language” for mathematics, and getting clear about what “exists” means was Frege’s central insight that made that possible.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote22_8d3u0tc" id="extra29_footnoteref22_8d3u0tc" title="Part of the obstacle to understanding nested quantifiers had been Aristotle’s misunderstanding of the existential quantifier even by itself. If you want to geek out about the history of logic, you can read about this in “The Square of Opposition.”">22</a></p>
<p>Jaynes is just saying “I don’t understand this, so it must all be nonsense.”</p>

<p class="intro_para"><dfn>Utilitarianism</dfn> is an ethical theory based on the intuition that one should act to produce the most good for everyone overall. That intuition is often right. Trying to make it the sole source of ethics always fails, though. This is an example of a non-theistic, rationalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalist</a> error.</p>
<p>Utilitarianism is an accountant’s theory of morality. (It appeals especially to atheists of a technical bent.) Suppose you have to choose between two actions. If you could predict all the results of each action, and if you could figure out how good (or bad) the results would be for everyone, and if you could combine all the goods and bads into a single total number, then you could compare the totals for each action, and choose the better one. (This is an example of the <a href="#chap67">continuum gambit</a>.)</p>
<p>Notice the “ifs” in this story. To make utilitarianism work, you’d have to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>predict all the effects of actions</li>
<li>assign a numerical goodness/badness of each effect on each person</li>
<li>combine these numbers into a meaningful total</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these tasks is quite impossible.</p>
<p>Utilitarianism is, therefore, a <a href="#chap64">wrong-way reduction</a>: it replaces the difficult but tractable problem of ethical decision-making with an absolutely hopeless one. This is just like the <a href="#chap64_wrong">sportsball problem</a> I discussed earlier. It is far easier to predict the winning team in a sportsball game than to predict how many goals will be made by each side.</p>
<p>The Other Leading Brands of ethical theory—deontology and virtue ethics—don’t require you to solve such problems. Deontology merely requires that you follow rules, and virtue ethics that you be a moral sort of person. These approaches have <em>other</em> dire defects, and <a href="#chap129">are quite wrong</a>. But they don’t require impossible feats of computation.</p>
<p>Utilitarians are undeterred. When pressed, they usually admit the impossibilities. Further, they admit that no known version of utilitarianism gives correct ethical answers <em>even in principle</em>, even if you could solve all the impossible problems.</p>
<p>The seemingly-simple ethical accounting turns turns fiendishly complicated once you dive into the details. Every accounting scheme produces clearly wrong results in some cases. Utilitiarians propose ever-more-complex approaches, each of which turns out to have its own pathologies. This obviates utilitarianism’s most attractive feature: its intuitive simplicity, at first glance, compared with the endless rules of deontology and the elaborately literary conceptions of virtue.</p>
<p>When challenged, utilitarians usually argue that, on balance, their theory is <em>less bad</em> than deontology or virtue ethics—which they regard as the only two possible alternatives. (The fact that all three are <em>clearly wrong</em> does not seem to motivate a search for other possibilities.)</p>
<p>Utilitiarians suggest that, even if it is impossible to calculate the overall goodness of actions, doing so even approximately is correct approach to ethics. They feel that there <em>must</em> be a version of their theory that actually works, and that all-purpose methods of approximating <em>must</em> exist—even though they are presently unknown. This is a nice example of eternalistic <a href="#chap51">wistful certainty</a>.</p>
<p>Eternalism is the denial of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<p>The nebulosity of ethics is uncomfortable. It means we can have no guarantee of acting ethically, no matter how hard we try. It means ethics is <em>really hard</em>.</p>
<p>Utilitarianism promised, at first glance, that ethics is easy, just a matter of adding some numbers. Looked at in detail, it makes ethics impossible, not merely <em>really hard</em>.</p>
<p>Eternalism is <a href="#chap31">always a con</a>; it always makes huge, infinitely desirable promises it <a href="#chap37">can’t fulfill</a>.</p>
<p>Later in the book, we’ll look at the ways ethical eternalism’s failure produces ghastly, unethical outcomes.</p>

<p class="intro_para">This is about the harm done by ideologically-distorted concepts of rationality. I wrote it in 1988. My main example came from nutrition. However, the actual subject, by satirical analogy, was cognitive “science,” which I discussed only briefly <a href="#extra29_cognitivescience">at the end</a>. Cognitive science was doubly distorted by rationality: it pretended to be rational itself, and also modeled people as rational in ways they aren’t.</p>
<p>I find little to disagree with now, so I’m republishing the text here unaltered.

<h2 id="extra29_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is an essay about <dfn>scientism</dfn>:<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_ei4qoc8" id="extra29_footnoteref1_ei4qoc8" title="Nowadays people argue about how “scientism” should be defined, in order to promote their particular ideologies of what counts as rational, and therefore what bodies of knowledge should be granted authoritative social power. That wasn’t true in 1988, or anyway I was unaware of it.

people and discourses that cast themselves as “scientific.”
It examines a particular case, “domestic science,” which is now plainly
bogus. Thereby it tries to illuminate, and to cast as bogus, other
cases (such as “cognitive science”) currently accepted as
legitimate.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>My theoretical framework here relies heavily on Michel Foucault’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679724699/?tag=meaningness-20">History of Sexuality↗︎︎</a>. This book is better titled in the French edition: <cite>The Will to Knowledge</cite>. It takes sex as a concrete example, but is actually concerned with the relationship between knowledge and power.</p>
<p>My concrete example is drawn from Laura Shapiro’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520257383/?tag=meaningness-20">Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century↗︎︎</a>.
Shapiro’s book is a history of the
“domestic science” movement. Domestic science was founded in the
late nineteenth century as, simultaneously, an intellectual discipline
and a reform movement, both directed at the improvement of cooking.
In its later manifestation as “home economics,” it had an overwhelming
effect on women’s lives that has abated only partly in the last twenty
years.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_3oj8abu" id="extra29_footnoteref2_3oj8abu" title="I.e. starting around 1968, twenty years before I wrote this.">2</a></p>
<p>Domestic science provides a neat illustration for the pathologies of
intellectualized rationality, authoritative knowledge, and
transcendence. Here at the end of the twentieth century, it seems
mostly absurd to think that science has anything much to say about
cooking,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_ude96pj" id="extra29_footnoteref3_ude96pj" title="Alas, a quarter-century later, “science” is still claiming authority over food, with results that have probably been catastrophic. I discuss that in the follow-up.">3</a> and we thus have a degree of distance on a particular manifestation of a group of connected twistednesses that still
dominate the way we think about most things.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_authoritativerecipes">Authoritative Recipes</h2>
<p>Domestic science, like everything that calls itself a “science”,
presented itself as a field of intellectual endeavor. Intellectual
fields are supposed ideally to be “detached.” However, the domestic
scientists primarily pursued a practical project: reforming the way
Americans cooked. To this end, they amassed vast power, as was
inevitably necessary to radically change the lives of tens of millions
of people. They pursued a particular route to this power, one which has
become extremely important in contemporary society: the validation of
discourse.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to thinking of power inhering in institutions and
political roles. In fact, as Foucault first pointed out, most power
in the modern world lies in discourse: in the control of knowledge.
However, these sorts of power are synergistic, and the domestic
scientists were able to accumulate considerable institutional power:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then they quickly assembled all the appurtenances necessary to a
full-fledged profession: syllabi for course work at every level,
degree-granting programs of study, a professional organization, a
journal, and annual meetings. … they could now join forces with
institutions that might help them solidify their position. Home
economics easily won a place in industry, education, and
government… and the arrangement satisfied everyone concerned.
(pp. 7–8)<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_sx3xfnf" id="extra29_footnoteref4_sx3xfnf" title="All page numbers are from the first (1986) edition.  I haven’t read the second (2008) one.">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This institutional power, however, was useful not so much because it
gave domestic scientists the ability to directly control other people’s
actions, but because it validated and gave authority to their discourse. </p>
<p>Knowledge is power only when it is accepted as authoritative. A
discourse is validated as authoritative when it is established that
any of a class of questions is to be answered in terms of that
discourse. In this case, domestic science established itself as the
discourse in terms of which any serious question about food would have
to be answered. The process of establishing institutional validation
for a body of discourse is a crucial part of assembling
power-through-control-of-knowledge. We can see it happening all
around us now; it is clearly visible, for example, in the
extraordinary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#Connectionism_vs._computationalism_debate">political success of connectionism↗︎︎</a>, whose modus operandi
is neatly described by the paragraph quoted above.</p>
<p>Once a group has established their knowledge as authoritative, anyone
who has direct power is forced to consult them, if only as an
ass-covering maneuver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Domestic scientists were being sought not only as teachers but as
experts, and in the field of institutional feeding their
participation became especially prominent. Many were invited to
examine the diets of hospital patients, prisoners, asylum inmates,
college students, and other groups subjected to quantity cooking on
a small budget, and to make recommendations for improving the
nutritional quality of food at the lowest cost. After their
disillusioning experience with the mass of poor and working people
[who insisted on eating food that tasted good], 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards">Mrs. Richards↗︎︎</a> and
her colleagues welcomed the opportunity to work with these more
captive populations. (p. 161)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the rest of my essay is concerned with just how the validation
of domestic science was achieved. What about a body of discourse makes
it easy to render authoritative? In our culture, the best strategy is
to cast the discourse as a “Science.” This strategy has been
followed, with varying degrees of success, by Domestic Science, Library
Science, Astrological Science, Materials Science, Agricultural Science,
Political Science, Sanitation Science, Dental Science, Management
Science, and Cognitive Science. The strategy involves smearing a
particular sort of rhetoric over the subject matter and the performance
of a variety of meaningless but culturally valorized rituals involving
the invocation of such deities as “precision” and “repeatability,”
scientific-looking tools, and the use of numbers whenever possible. The
goal is to make the actual practices of the group resemble those of
physicists as nearly as possible.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_scientificfood">Scientific Food</h2>
<p>At the time domestic science was at its height only two things were
actually known about food: that different foods had different energy
densities (measurable in calories per ounce) and that food was made up
of varying proportions of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Nothing more
would be learned until the discovery of the vitamins two decades later.
This did not stop domestic scientists from proposing that every
housewife be taught considerable amounts of any science that seemed
potentially relevant, including, for example, psychology, physiology,
bacteriology, and chemistry (p. 65). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the housekeeper could be made to think of herself as a scientist,
calmly at work over the beakers and burners in her laboratory, then
every meal would emerge as she planned, pristine and invariable.
(p. 86) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science genuinely relevant to food had yet to be invented. So domestic
scientists applied irrelevant science, and prescribed scientific-seeming
rituals to be adhered to when cooking. For instance, a science is
supposed to involve experiments, and demands that these experiments be
repeatable. The rhetoric of domestic science equates cooking with
laboratory experimentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…an enthusiastic social reformer in the domestic-science movement
complained … that “even the intelligent housekeeper still talks
about ‘luck with her sponge cake.’ <em>Luck!</em> There is no such word
in science, and to make sponge cake is a scientific process!” (p. 86) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the hallmarks of science is measuring things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exact measurement was the foundation for everything else that
happened in the scientific kitchen, although there was not always
agreement about how to reach exactitude. (p. 115)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Domestic science invented standardized measures for food in the 1880s.
The cup was standardized as a half-pint at this point, for instance. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Fannie] Farmer’s interest in exact measurements went far beyond
cups and spoons, however: she liked to specify that strips of
pimento used for decoration be cut three-quarters of an inch long
and half an inch wide, and she could measure out spices by the
grain. (p. 116)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other things that could be measured were all the basic chemical
properties of food. Energy density is still considered relevant, but
very few of the others are; except in a few extreme cases, the pH of
foods is irrelevant. However, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Chemical analysis should be the guide for the cookery book,” she
urged, and looked forward gladly to the day when a laboratory
microscope would be standard equipment in every kitchen. (p. 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some domestic scientists advocated that every kitchen include complete
equipment for quantitative chemical analysis.</p>
<p>Science is big on charts and graphs, and domestic scientists rose to the
challenge. Shapiro shows, for instance, a “Cupcake chart” with a huge
matrix of numerical entries, and describes a “meal chart” in which </p>
<blockquote>
<p>…protein, carbohydrate, and fat were distributed with an
exactitude that demanded kitchen scales, a ruler, and some
arithmetic. Atop two rolls, for example (combined weight, two
ounces; cost, two cents; percent protein .170; calories, 163), the
man was permitted to spread a one-inch cube of butter (weight, one
ounce; cost, two and a quarter cents; percent protein, none;
calories, 224)… What eluded her scrutiny, however, was the nature
of the food itself. To balance a meal by numbers alone, ignoring
taste and texture, meant that creamed potatoes, creamed vegetable
soup, macaroni with cream sauce, salad with creamy dressing, and
gelatin with cream were all listed on the menu for Day Two, along
with stewed prunes, stewed corn, and stewed tomatoes. (p. 209)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the ultimate manifestation of this was the “Dietary Computer”
(no kidding) invented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Swallow_Richards">Ellen Swallow Richards↗︎︎</a>, who was the first woman
graduate of and first woman instructor at (of course!) 
MIT.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_b325f3x" id="extra29_footnoteref5_b325f3x" title="Despite my poking fun at her here, she had an impressive career and seems to have been overall a Good Thing.">5</a></p>

<figcaption class="ctrimgcaption">Ellen Swallow Richards
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Meal plans were justified in terms of the process of digestion, or
rather the process as it was understood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meal began with a clear soup, which Mrs. Rorer planned
specifically for its lack of nutritive properties. The stomach was
supposed to simply rest on the soup, gathering strength, as she
explained it, “before the heavy work of digesting a spare rib.”
Applesauce accompanied the spare rib, the acid countering the fat,
according to rule… (p. 80)</p>
<p>…the chewing required by salted almonds would increase the
circulation of blood. In this way a good supply of blood would be
furnished to the stomach… (p. 81)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I find most interesting in all this is that the domestic scientists
knew that their understanding of nutrition was very incomplete, but they
did not hesitate to make prescriptions for action based on them that
determined the way Americans ate for more than half a century. What
little genuine understanding they had did not support these
prescriptions. For instance, they could measure energy density. By
itself, though, energy density tells you nothing about how to cook. So
they made the arbitrary assumption that more was better, and used as much
sugar and fat as possible (p. 76). To this assumption can probably be
credited tens of millions of deaths from heart disease.</p>
<p>Many of the variables on which the domestic scientists’ prescriptions
were based, such as pH, seem now to us to be irrelevant, and others that
we consider central couldn’t be measured and so did not enter into the
prescriptions. Since vitamins had not been discovered, domestic
scientists were not big on fruits or vegetables, which didn’t have much
protein, carbohydrate, <em>or</em> fat in them, and mostly seemed to be water.</p>
<p>Domestic scientists assumed that the ratios of protein, carbohydrate, and
fat were relevant variables, and based diet plans on theories of the
“correct” ratios. “Nutrition scientists” are still doing this, and
so far as I can tell they still don’t know what the “correct” ratios
are, because every five years they confidently declare that they have
discovered with complete certainty that we should have twenty-three
percent or thirty-seven percent or seventeen percent protein in our
diets, and American eating habits obediently shift accordingly. Most
likely there are no “correct” ratios, because lots of other variables
are involved.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rationalcookery">Rational Cookery</h2>
<p>The cult of science is part of the cult of rationality. By
“rationality” here I mean rationality as an intellectualized
prescriptive ideal. Ultimately, it is by presenting a discourse as
rational that it is validated. Presenting it as scientific is one means
to this end. Rationality requires other rhetoric and ritual practices,
not strictly scientific, which we can see in operation in domestic
science.</p>
<p>Rationality mandates <a href="#chap34">control</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…color-coordinated meals… represented most of all the
achievement of an extraordinary degree of control over the messy,
unpredictable business of the kitchen. (p. 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationality demands that practice accord to formal rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than learning to consult their instincts, their sense of
taste, or their imaginations, fledgling cooks were taught to depend
on rules, which existed on a lofty plane far above the pleasures of
appetite. (p. 90)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationality prescribes <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary degree of predictability that was the triumph of
mass-produced food had been sought for years by laboratory-based
scientific cooks, and its achievement represented the fulfillment of
one of the major goals of domestic science: the attainment of
certainty. An ever-sturdier sense of finitude, objectivity, and
perfect control could now be discerned in recipes and meal
plans… (p. 206)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationality requires “objectivity,” or distance from the subject
matter. The ideal was a “carefully maintained impersonality between
the cook and the food” (p. 211). This is accomplished, in part, by
abstract representation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, in fact, it was possible for a cooking teacher to strip
away so much of what she considered extraneous to the process of
cookery that the remainder could be reduced to a chart, itself a
stunning acknowledgement of the now frozen distance that separated
the cook from the food. (p. 206)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationality promotes generalizations, even when these do great violence
to the phenomena.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studying the diets of black tenant farmers in Alabama, then, the
investigators noted that women and children often worked in the
fields alongside the men, but since there was no way according to
the method to take that work into consideration, or to assign
nutritional needs to it, they decided for convenience sake to assume
that it didn’t exist. (p. 167)</p>
<p>One participant at the fourth Lake Placid conference had taken an
informal poll of twenty-two families to find out what they ate, and
the results distressed her. Although there was a great deal of
repetition in the daily menus within each household, she told her
colleagues, the variety from house to house was dizzying. Evidently
“local tastes and family idiosyncrasies” still exerted a powerful
influence over the dinner table, preventing the development of
“conscious standards” in meal planning. … “It is true that all
people do not demand the same kind of food. This is due sometimes
to acquired appetites, sometimes due to finicalities of appetite due
to bad living and sometimes to the fact that people have not enough
other interests besides that in eating and drinking.” When people
advance to the stage of what she called “rational living” … they
would find that “unreasonable preferences for particular foods”
disappeared. (pp. 213–214)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observing the meticulous rituals of rationality is the high road to
status in our culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… these [completely bogus] dietary investigations helped boost
domestic scientists to a new height of self-respect. The clean and
precise task of gathering information for scientific analysis could
not possibly be confused with cooking, much less eating, and the
institutional backing of the federal government gave the work an
orderliness and a magnitude that surpassed their most ambitious
reveries. To have acknowledged individual quirks like pregnancy or
child labor would only have interrupted the smooth operation of the
intellectual machinery, and dragged down the whole process into a
slough of those idiosyncratic emotional responses traditionally
called female. (p. 167)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rationality worship is central to many, perhaps most, of the
twistednesses of our culture. I should like to say a lot more about
this here, but the topic is too large. I think you can imagine that if
we analyzed most other parts of contemporary culture we would find them
shot through with the same disease we find here in cooking. I would
very much like to study the way in which rationality worship, a form of
institutionalized insanity, gives rise to both individual and group
twistedness.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_transcendingphysicality">Transcending Physicality</h2>
<p>No matter how modern, civilized, rational, and scientific we are, some
activities remind us that we have somehow failed to escape 
<a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/you-being-meat">being animals; bodies; physical objects↗︎︎</a>. Eating is one.
Thus, we eat in ritualized ways that try to deny, as much as possible,
that it is a necessary bodily process. The bestiality of eating is
enhanced by the fact that what we eat is other living things. I
occasionally suddenly realize that the thing I am putting in my mouth is
a part cut out of the sexual organ of a plant which sat around outdoors,
rested on earth, got rained on, had bugs wander over it, and pumped sap
around inside itself, and am momentarily <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/disgust-as-buddhist-practice">horrified and disgusted↗︎︎</a>. One
of the great goals, and eventually triumphant successes, of domestic
science was to disguise the bodily nature of food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most authorities recommended one to three hours’ boiling for string
beans, forty-five minutes for asparagus, twenty minutes for
cucumbers, half an hour for celery, and up to twelve hours for
beets. … Salad greens, which did have to be served raw and crisp,
demanded more complicated measures. The object of scientific salad
making was to subdue the raw greens until they bore as little
resemblance as possible to their natural state. … One cook
recommended cutting lettuce leaves into “ribbons of uniform width”
for a more orderly arrangement, and the most popular version of a
spinach salad required the spinach to be boiled, drained, chopped,
molded into little cups, unmolded, and decorated with a neat slice
of hardboiled egg. (p. 96)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The physicality of food makes it disagreeable not only to eat but also
to cook. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Handling food, she emphasized in a letter in a letter to Atkinson,
was “distasteful to women” … [meat in particular] cannot be
handled without disgust. (p. 151)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various devices were invented to avoid the necessity of actually
touching food while cooking it: the chafing dish, mechanical bread
kneaders, and a device known as the Aladdin Oven, for example. </p>
<p>Food, ideally, ought to be stripped of concrete properties; those
properties it retains should be as pure and abstract as possible. This
ideal was triumphantly realized in the development of products like
Cheez-Whiz and Jell-O, which have no texture, pure primary colors, and
no identifiable source in the natural world. Kool-Whip additionally has
an elemental flavor, being simply sweet. Crisco, then, is the ultimate
food product, having no texture, color, or flavor; a food so abstract it
is easy to forget that it is coarsely physical, and to imagine that it
resides rather in the realm of Platonic forms, side by side with
cylindric algebras and cohomology groups.</p>
<p>This attempt to deny physicality is a central theme in our culture, one
closely connected with that of rationality. </p>
<h2 id="extra29_cognitivescience">Domestic Science is to Food as Cognitive Science is to People</h2>
<p>It seems now to us ludicrous that science should have much to say
about cooking, yet this was accepted without question in our parents’
generation. It is now accepted without question that science has a
great deal to say about “cognition.” And our views of what sort of
things we are, and a great many institutional policies, are shaped by
what “cognitive scientists” say about us. Cognitive science is
twisted by rationality worship twice: as with other sciences, it
twists its own methods to conform to rationality’s dictates, but it
also reads rationality into its own subject matter, casting people as
rational. </p>
<p>To make my analogy explicit, cognitive scientists, like domestic ones,
are wont to apply irrelevant branches of science, smear empty
mathematics over the phenomena, make absurd generalizations from
variables they can measure while neglecting anything they can’t, adopt
outward trappings of physicists even when they are inappropriate,
constantly engage in meaningless “scientific” rituals, and make
confident policy recommendations (e.g. concerning education) based
on what they know to be extremely incomplete understandings. As
rational beings, they both seek for themselves and impute to their
subject matter control, practice according to formal rules, certain
knowledge, objectivity, abstract representation, and generalization.</p>
<p>Seeing the absurdity of these practices in domestic science should
make cognitive science also look absurd. I think it likely that
“cognitive science” will seem as much of an anachronistic oxymoron
in thirty years time as “domestic science” does now.</p>
<p>Just as cooking is slowly recovering from domestic science, our
understanding of ourselves will slowly recover after cognitive science
is discredited.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_epilogue">Epilogue, 2014</h2>

<p>Dear human species,</p>
<p>Today we, the professionals of nutrition, offer you our resignation. This letter—signed by virtually every nutrition scientist and technician, clinical nutritionist, dietician, and food journalist, worldwide—is our heartfelt apology.</p>
</div>
<p>We screwed up. We failed completely.</p>
<p>We may have killed millions of people. We’re really, really sorry about that. However:</p>
<p>Our most important message to you today is: we know <em><a href="#chap73">absolutely nothing</a></em> about nutrition. Our field is intellectually bankrupt.</p>
<p>What’s worse, we have no clue <em>how to find out</em> anything about nutrition.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The only conclusion we can draw, from decades of elaborate and extremely expensive research, is that our research methods don’t work.</p>
<p>Admittedly, in retrospect, many of us were incompetent, were biased or outright corrupted by power interests, or pursued personal food ideologies that had no basis in data. However, even our largest, most careful studies, funded by neutral parties and run by our best scientists, gave only equivocal results.</p>
<p>We’d totally understand if you never want to have anything to do with us again. There’s no reason you should listen to anything we have to say. However, we do have two requests.</p>
<ol>
<li>We’re pretty darn sure <em>no one else</em> knows anything about nutrition, either. Please don’t listen to “alternative” nutrition quacks. We’ve been there, and we know.</li>
<li>Obviously, there’s no point doing any more nutrition research for the foreseeable future. It would just be more of the same. However, we’d like to ask that some of the nutrition research budget be redirected into <em>meta-nutritional</em> research: to try to understand why we failed, and if there are other methods that might work.</li>
<li>Please eat a healthy, balanced diet.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>[Every nutritionist in the world]</p>
<p><sup>1.</sup> Just kidding!</p>

<p>Dear nutrition professionals,</p>
<p>Apparently, you <em>are</em> clueless. You have no idea what your jobs are.</p>
<p>As your employers, we thought we were hiring people with more than two neurons, who could figure out the obvious without having it spelled out completely literally. But no.</p>
<p>Your job is to wear white lab coats while saying that food ingredients are healthy and unhealthy, and to wave charts around. That makes the ingredients <em>authoritatively</em> healthy and unhealthy, which covers our asses.</p>
<p>Some of us have to feed <em>something</em> to school children. Parents demand that school lunches be “healthy.” What does that mean? You don’t know, and <em>we don’t care.</em> What matters is that when parents sue the school district, we can point at you waving charts around. “See! Science! Science says it’s healthy! Go away!”</p>
<p>Some of us have to sell breakfast pastries. Consumers demand that their breakfast be “healthy.” We <em>know</em> you have no idea what that means, because for every ingredient on our master list of industrial food components, you have said it was good one year and bad the next. We <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6698">made up our own chart↗︎︎</a>, you know? Three columns: ingredient, study that proves it causes cancer, study that proves it prevents cancer. Our food engineers make pastries out of whatever optimizes cost and shelf life, and then the marketing department pastes “<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Coreopsis free! Now with added chelicerates!</span>” on it. That’s what makes a healthy breakfast pastry.</p>
<p>Some of us make most of what everyone eats: high fructose corn syrup, soy oil, and wheat flour. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland">Just one↗︎︎</a> of our companies sold $81 billion of that stuff last year. It has been authoritatively proven to be healthy. By Science. By you.</p>
<p>Go back to work. Your resignations are hereby rejected. If you refuse to continue waving confusing charts around, we will hire other people who are less fussy. There <em>will</em> be nutritionists; we don’t care whether or not they are you.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>[The governments of every country in the world, the agriculture industry, the food processing industry, the supermarket industry, and so forth.]</p>

<p class="intro_para">More than a quarter century ago, in “<a href="#chap71">Perfection Salad</a>,” I wrote: “It now seems ludicrous that science should have much to say about cooking… cooking is slowly recovering from ‘domestic science’.” In the 2014 epilogue, I asked: “<em>Has</em> food recovered from domestic science?”</p>
<ul>
<li>“Domestic science” was rebranded as “nutrition science,” with all the same pathologies. That has yielded <em>zero</em> reliable knowledge.</li>
<li>Despite complete ignorance, nutrition “science” issued and enforced confident recommendations that may have been responsible for millions of premature deaths, plus great loss of health and quality of life.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, industry has developed considerable genuine science of food—oriented to optimizing commercial ends, rather than health and tastiness.</li>
<li>Partial public awareness of these problems has produced a proliferation of pseudoscientific, quasi-religious food subcultures.</li>
<li>Passionate belief in mythical meanings of food probably have a evolutionary origin.</li>
<li>Recently, some pundits have started to suspect that—as I suggested in 1988—<em>no one knows what makes food healthy</em>. Perhaps now the public can begin to resist all claims to authoritative food-knowledge.</li>

<h2 id="extra29_eternalism">Food, eternalism, scientism, and pseudoscience</h2>
<p>Nutrition ideologies rest on the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalist</a> <a href="#chap38">ploy</a> I call “<a href="#chap51">wistful certainty</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There <em>must</em> be a correct diet; there <em>must</em> be a rational way to discover it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s no reason to believe either of those; indeed, there’s strong evidence against each of them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_1r2pb9b" id="extra29_footnoteref1_1r2pb9b" title="There are healthy non-Western populations with diets very different from each other’s. Some of those may be somewhat better than others, but there’s no strong reason to believe so. A century of scientific research has failed to discover any nutritional facts. More and better research might; but we can’t be certain of that a priori.">1</a>  The power of wistful certainty comes from the unspoken alternative: “otherwise, we would have no <a href="#chap34">control</a> over our health, <a href="#chap63">Science would fail</a>, and the world would be hostile and unfair and we might as well just give in to <a href="#chap42">hopeless</a> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss1')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.”</p>
<p>This ploy underlies both obviously silly New Age nutrition pseudoscience and authoritative state-endorsed nutrition pseudoscience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes you call nutrition “pseudoscience?” That seems like a wild claim. It’s true that it has failed repeatedly, but isn’t that the way science works? We can’t <a href="#chap32">demand certainty</a>; science can only say what is most likely based on the available evidence. It’s true that a lot of studies have been done badly, but that doesn’t invalidate the best work; it just means we need to insist on better experimental methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always uncertainty in science, but real science gradually establishes some stable facts; it eventually strongly supports some theories and conclusively dismisses others. It is typical of pseudoscience that it does not progress.</p>
<p>Nutrition has made no progress. It has discovered no stable facts. Everything nutritionists have said, they have said the opposite ten or twenty years later (if not much sooner). They literally <em>know nothing</em>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_wl1473g" id="extra29_footnoteref2_wl1473g" title="For “literally know nothing,” see for example the recent Ioannidis editorial in the BMJ. There are two exceptions. First, they know you should shouldn’t eat poisons. Arsenic and polychlorinated biphenyls are bad for you. Second, there are some chemicals (vitamins, for instance) that you have to get some of, or else you get a deficiency disease. Neither of these facts are relevant to anyone with a vaguely normal diet. ">2</a> After a century of countless experiments, the most common, most basic problem they’ve addressed—the optimal ratio of fat, protein, and carbohydrate—is completely unsolved. If they can’t figure <em>that</em> out, anything more sophisticated seems hopeless.</p>
<p>Nutrition is now both scientism and pseudoscience. This is a somewhat rare combination; <a href="#chap74">cognitive science</a> is another example, as I pointed out in “<a href="#chap71">Perfection Salad</a>.” Scientism—the eternalistic distortion of science into an authoritative source of meaning—is most harmful when the science is bogus. Pseudoscience is most harmful when it gets the support of the state and other powerful institutions. Food and theories of the mind probably both strongly affect human well-being, so they are particularly bad subjects to have turned into scientism or pseudoscience.</p>
<p>My point is not that nutrition is bad science. Unquestionably, <a href="http://io9.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800">↗︎︎</a>; a competent statistician, looking at the design of most experiments, will immediately say “<a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf">this is meaningless↗︎︎</a>; you can’t learn anything this way.”</p>
<p>It’s worse than just incompetence, in two ways. First, as the “<a href="#chap72">resignation letter</a>” noted, even the best studies have been useless. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong, such that doing the same sort of science better wouldn’t help.</p>
<p>The second, still worse implication is that worthless pseudoscience can get treated as authoritative for a century, and even now. This is partly due to <a href="rationalist-eternalism">rationalist eternalism↗︎︎</a>, and partly due to institutional imperatives produced by malign social dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_kills">In which “Science” kills a few million people</h2>
<p>Just when I wrote “Perfection Salad,” in the mid–80s, nutrition had its greatest breakthrough. “Scientists” “discovered” that fat (especially saturated fat, and doubly especially cholesterol) was the cause of the two biggest causes of death in rich countries: cardiovascular disease and cancer.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_0d98xte" id="extra29_footnoteref3_0d98xte" title="The supposed connection with cardiovascular disease goes back to the work of Ancel Keys in the 1950s. However, avoiding saturated fat and cholesterol for cardiovascular reasons only became the mainstream message around 1980. The supposed cancer connection was new in the mid–80s, and gave further credence and urgency to the anti-fat campaign.">3</a> Cardiovascular disease is caused by fat (especially cholesterol) accumulating in blood vessels. So, obviously, eating less fat will prevent cardiovascular disease. Cancer is caused by oxygen free radicals chemically modifying fat into a form that attacks DNA, creating mutations, so obviously if you eat less fat, that happens less.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_07b9ro1" id="extra29_footnoteref4_07b9ro1" title="This led also to the recommendation that you should eat more antioxidants. That message is still common, although most follow-on studies of specific antioxidants found that they are bad for you.">4</a> Besides, fat has twice as many calories as protein or carbohydrate, so obviously if you eat less fat, you won’t get unhealthily overweight.</p>
<p>There was <a href="http://openheart.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000196.full">virtually no actual evidence↗︎︎</a> for any of this, but it made sense. (“It makes sense!” is the <a href="/it-makes-sense">rationalist basis for all pseudoscience↗︎︎</a>.) “Obviously, it’s urgent that Americans be protected from cardiovascular disease and cancer, so waiting for conclusive evidence before sounding the alarm would be irresponsible.”</p>
<p>A massive public “education” campaign followed. Perhaps astonishingly, in response, Americans dutifully drastically decreased their fat intake (especially cholesterol). This followed the pattern I described in 1988:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Domestic scientists assumed that the ratios of protein, carbohydrate, and fat were relevant variables, and based diet plans on theories of the “correct” ratios. “Nutrition scientists” are still doing this, and so far as I can tell they still don’t know what the “correct” ratios are, because every five years they confidently declare that they have discovered with complete certainty that we should have twenty-three percent or thirty-seven percent or seventeen percent protein in our diets, and American eating habits obediently shift accordingly. Most likely there are no “correct” ratios, because lots of other variables are involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An epidemic of obesity began just around the time this “education” campaign began. Health outcomes have been awful. It seems likely that low-fat diet advice actually caused the diseases it was supposed to prevent.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_f7gym3u" id="extra29_footnoteref5_f7gym3u" title="Since nothing is actually known about nutrition, we can’t be sure the low-fat diet caused the obesity epidemic. Correlation is not causation; but it’s quite suggestive in this case.">5</a> In any case, most studies concluded that dietary cholesterol does not increase blood cholesterol and does not cause cardiovascular disease; and the saturated fat evidence <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1846638">varies↗︎︎</a> between weak, zero, and counter to the low-fat theory.</p>
<p>Some people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/magazine/what-if-it-s-all-been-a-big-fat-lie.html">started pointing this out↗︎︎</a> more than a decade ago,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_yt1jnfu" id="extra29_footnoteref6_yt1jnfu" title="The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet is supposed to be a good history. I haven’t read it.">6</a> and it’s now <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/low-fat/">nearly the mainstream view↗︎︎</a>. However, nutritional authorities aren’t quite ready to admit to <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7654">killing a few million people↗︎︎</a> with their bad advice.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_aftermath">In the aftermath of failure</h2>
<p>As of early 2015, the establishment is trying to figure out how to retract their anti-fat advice, while doing as little damage as possible to their reputation. They are sending up various <a href="http://openheart.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000229.long">waffly↗︎︎</a> <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/nutrition-panel-calls-for-less-sugar-and-eases-cholesterol-and-fat-restrictions/">trial balloons↗︎︎</a>, experimenting with PR strategies.</p>
<p>Saving nutrition’s reputation is a matter of self-interest. Also, many in the field are probably just too stupid to realize the magnitude of their failure, and honestly assume that somehow Science <em>must</em> know something.</p>
<p>However, more sophisticated players seem to be thinking: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admitting outright that we were wrong could discredit nutrition permanently—or <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/109880240641/sciences-biggest-fail">even Science as a whole↗︎︎</a>. Even though we know nothing now, with better Science, we’ll probably discover the truth soon. It’s critical to preserve respect until then, so people will listen when we get it right. Otherwise, they’ll fall prey to New Age woo and commercial quack diet faddery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can hear this in the background of the waffling. I think it is too late; the public is already losing trust.</p>
<p>There’s another problem: if the advice is not anti-fat, what can it be? Some in the field seem to be trying to establish a new consensus, organizing to make anti-sugar the new message. This would take us back to the 1960s–70s, when sugar was the Big Bad. Maybe it is. Who knows? I’m reasonably sure nutritionists don’t.</p>
<p>Another PR strategy has been to blame wrong dietary recommendations on corruption, due to industrial influence. Probably corruption has, indeed, been a significant factor. However, this is a typical example of the eternalist strategy of <a href="#chap34_breakdown">explaining away failure</a> as due to extraneous factors, which preserves the illusion of present and future competence.</p>
<p>Why <em>has</em> nutrition science failed? At this point, we can’t know. I believe that all available nutrition research funding should be redirected to answering that question. In the mean time, I’ll speculate:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may not matter what you eat. For example, Ioannidis has <a href="http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf">recently argued↗︎︎</a> that reported nutritional effect sizes must be grossly overstated, and diet may not have a significant effect on health after all. On the other hand, the observation that peoples become much less healthy when they start eating Western food does suggest that diet is significant. However, this might be due to simultaneous adoption of some other, as-yet unidentified harmful aspects of the Western lifestyle.</li>
<li>It may be that what makes a healthy diet is so different for different people (due to different genetics and/or lifestyles) that experiments done on mixed populations are meaningless. (I think this is relatively unlikely, for evolutionary reasons, but worth pursuing as a possibility.)</li>
<li>An intriguing possibility is that what you eat matters, but not for you. Until recently, all nutritional research assumed that dietary effects worked via human metabolism. Recent studies suggest that gut bacteria play an important role in human health, and that diet affects them much more than it affects human cells. If this is right, biochemical studies of diet have been looking at irrelevant factors for the past century. (I hope this is right, because it might lead to rapid progress, and also because it’s funny.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra29_capture">Reverse regulatory capture</h2>
<p>Honest nutrition scientists would, as in my satirical “<a href="#chap72">resignation letter</a>,” admit that the field has failed, they know nothing, and they cannot now give any meaningful recommendations. I think this would actually be more likely to preserve public trust, in the long run, than the current attempts at waffling and bluffing and muddling. The field is probably too cowardly for honesty, though. The emperor now realizes he has been seen parading naked, but will pretend not to know, to save face.</p>
<p>Anyway, as the “rejection” reply letter explains, institutional imperatives make it impossible to admit ignorance. There <em>will</em> be nutritional recommendations, even if every nutritionist has to be fired in order to create them. Governments, and the food industry, cannot accept that nothing is known, because they would no longer have any basis for their institutional policies. They do not care much what the policies <em>are</em>; but it is critical that they <em>exist</em>.</p>
<p>Initially “domestic science” captured regulators;<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_p055j9s" id="extra29_footnoteref7_p055j9s" title="I described this in “Perfection Salad.”">7</a> but then state institutions captured nutritional “science.” Once it was established that there were authoritative facts-of-the-matter about what people should eat, state institutions (schools, prisons, the military) needed stable, simple, crisp guidelines about what they were allowed to feed people. For school administrators, it doesn’t matter what the nutritional theory <em>is</em>, but it is critical that there be an <em>authoritative</em> theory they can demonstrate conformity to, in order to remain blameless. So the power here is mainly in the authority-giving power of rationalistic discourse, not in the institutions (much less individuals).</p>
<h2 id="extra29_processed">The processed food revolution</h2>
<p>In 1988, most American meals were still cooked from scratch. Now that’s rare. Nearly all American food is the product of intensive industrial engineering systems. These rely on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_science">new, genuine food science↗︎︎</a>—about how to reliably extrude optimized food-like products, not about what is healthy or (for the most part) tasty. The capture of food by rationality is therefore essentially complete; but it is rationality optimizing for ends we might not choose.</p>
<p>Since we don’t actually know anything about nutrition, it’s impossible to know whether the new engineered food products are unhealthy. From the food industry’s point of view, uncertainty is good, because nowadays <em>any</em> food can be labelled with multiple supposedly-beneficial qualities, according to assorted competing theories (probably none of which have any relationship to reality).<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_i8fjkqz" id="extra29_footnoteref8_i8fjkqz" title="Ioannidis notes that “Almost every single nutrient imaginable has peer reviewed publications associating it with almost any outcome.”">8</a></p>
<p>The obesity epidemic suggests <em>something</em> has gone badly wrong with the Western diet, in which case it must have <em>something</em> to do with processed food, just because nearly all food is now processed.</p>
<p>One of the trial new messages being tested by the nutrition establishment is “avoid processed food,” which has the big advantage (for their future credibility) that no one is likely to adopt it. Cooking has become an unacceptable hassle.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_xf2zklk" id="extra29_footnoteref9_xf2zklk" title="Disclosure: I do avoid processed food, and most of what I eat I cook from scratch. This is not advice.">9</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_resistance">Public recognition and resistance</h2>
<p>Until recently, public opposition to official food recommendations was mainly religious or “ethical.” The <a href="#extra27">monist counterculture</a> (“New Age”), a quasi-religious movement, has produced a series of opposition diets since the 1970s. Although some of these invoked pseudoscience, and made vague health claims, they were all mainly moralistic. They were anti-scientific and anti-capitalist (as monism typically is). The rise of politically-correct food labelling (“fair trade”) may have been partly in response to increasing public realization of the dubiosity of nutritional claims, but it was mainly explicitly ethical.</p>
<p>An uneasy sense that nutrition recommendations had changed too many times, too quickly, seems to have gradually dawned on the public starting about a decade ago. Up until then, almost everyone simply accepted official pronouncements without question. Early 2000s studies supporting the high-fat Atkins diet seem to have shifted the mood. Intelligent people recognized that nutritional advice is uncertain, and liable to change again soon. So then you have to ask: why bother paying attention to the current guidelines?</p>
<p>There’s been another, dramatic change over the past year (starting late in 2014, I think). Science-savvy members of the commentariat—journalists and bloggers—are finally starting to recognize that there is <em>no there, there</em>: nutrition <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/109880240641/sciences-biggest-fail">has no cards to play↗︎︎</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_78nj1ox" id="extra29_footnoteref10_78nj1ox" title="The paleo movement has played a major role in this. Paleo is interesting as a subculture that combines romantic rebellion with scientistic rationalism. That potent combination that has made it the most effective anti-authoritarian diet ideology so far. With difficulty, I’ve resisted writing more about that here; this page is already too long.">10</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_meaningful">Meaningful food</h2>
<p>It’s extraordinary how <a href="#chap32">certain</a> and passionate everyone is  about their nutritional beliefs—mainstream or alternative—despite the lack of any basis for them. Religion and politics are the only other domains that commonly inspire such delusional commitment.</p>
<p>Every human culture gives elaborate meanings to food—to hunting, gathering, growing, harvesting, processing, cooking, sharing, and eating it. Every culture has elaborate ideologies of what you should and should not do with food—most of which seem insane to anyone from a different culture. (These constitute the standard example of the eternalist ploy of <a href="#chap55">purity</a>.)</p>
<p>Food is hugely evolutionarily important, so it is not surprising that humans give it such meanings. It’s rather more surprising that something so evolutionarily important should have such divergent meanings attached. Aren’t most of them maladaptive?</p>
<p>A speculation: Perhaps the urge to give foods meanings is a relic of our former hunter-gatherer lifestyle, when keeping track of the edibility, habits, and best use of thousands of species was important. Mythological narratives (“we are forbidden to eat that berry by Flying-Buffalo-Woman, who was tricked with one by Centipede-God”) were valuable as mnemonics encoding cultural knowledge. Often that could be a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even though the evolutionary purpose is lost, we can’t help making up myths about food, and still feel compelled into believing and enforcing them.</p>
<p>I will discuss the meanings given food again in two later chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#chap127">ethics chapter</a> considers the moralization of food. There are legitimate ethical questions, but many claims I find highly dubious: not because they are ethically wrong, but because the issues are not ethical ones at all. I use these as examples of a broader phenomenon: the metastasis of morality into domains where it has no business.</li>
<li>In the <a href="#chap148">history of meaningness</a> chapter, I will describe how the meaning of food has changed over the past few decades, as we’ve moved through the systematic, counter-cultural, subcultural, atomized, and fluid modes of relating to meaningness.</li>

<p class="intro_para">The climax of “<a href="#chap71">Perfection Salad</a>” made fun of “cognitive science.” I dismissed it as a pseudo-science that had twisted our understanding of what people are like. That was in 1988, when people still took it seriously. In the 2014 epilogue, I asked: “Has our understanding of ourselves recovered?”</p>
<p>The short answer, unfortunately, is “no.” The reason is that the delusions of cognitive “science” were transferred to neuroscience, which has continued to propagate the same wrong ideas into mass culture.</p>
<p>“Perfection Salad” was written for an audience of cognitive scientists, just at the time it was becoming obvious that the field had failed. My readers understood the issues in detail, and could see, as they were reading about cupcake recipes, how I was satirizing their discipline. Readers of <cite>Meaningness</cite> won’t have that background, so I will fill in some explanation here.</p>
<p>However, I can sketch only briefly the cognitivist conception of people and why it is wrong. The background concepts needed to explain exactly what’s wrong come only <a href="#chap106">later in this book</a>. So I won’t try persuade you if you accept those ideas currently.</p>
<p>Instead, this page will explain something of why those ideas matter, where they came from, how and why they traveled from philosophy to cognitive science to neuroscience, and the damage they do.</p>
<p>The “damage” section takes as an example Sam Harris’s justification for America’s wars in the Middle East, supposedly based on cognitive neuroscience as applied to Muslims. I take no position here on those wars. However, his ideas about how Muslim “beliefs” causally result in violence are ludicrous and harmful.</p>

<p class="intro_para"><dfn>Political eternalism</dfn> starts with the wistful certainty that:</p>
<blockquote class="intro_para"><p>There <em>must</em> be a correct system of government; so if we adopted it, it would solve most political problems</p></blockquote>

[Click for details.]">stance</a> that everything has a fixed meaning, given by some sort of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss1')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>. </p>
<p>“<a href="#chap51">Wistful certainty</a>” is a <a href="#chap38">ploy</a> for maintaining eternalism. The certainty is wistful because, even if there somehow is a correct system of government, we don’t know what it is. That is unacceptable, however; governance is too important for it to be <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a> (uncertain; indefinite). If it were nebulous, the Cosmic Plan would be defective. This creates a cognitive dissonance that eternalism resolves by creating an artificial certainty that some political system is absolutely justified.</p>
<p>This spurious certainty can lead to hideous tyrannies. However, the root problem is just thinking that there must <em>be</em> some correct form. Once you have that idea, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that whatever form seems best (or is most convenient) is indeed the cosmically right one.</p>
<p>The ploys political eternalism uses to maintain itself in the face of doubt are strikingly similar to religious ones.</p>
<p>Also, for many people, political eternalism functions as an overarching all-purpose foundation for meaning, much as religions can. This has become particularly true in the past hundred years as religions have been widely discredited, but people still feel the need of a foundation for meaning.</p>
<p>This has been discussed widely by social theorists as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_religion">political religion↗︎︎</a>”; critics rightly point out that political systems are not actually religions, although they have some of the same functions. The concept “<a href="#chap59">non-theistic eternalism</a>” is helpful here in explaining the similarities.</p>
<p>[This page will provide an overview of political eternalism, introducing a section on the topic. Pages in the section will cover various instances and aspects of the phenomenon.]</p>
<p>[Here’s a nice quote:]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man of system, on the contrary, is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. He goes on to establish it completely and in all its parts, without any regard either to the great interests, or to the strong prejudices which may oppose it. He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it.<br/>

<p class="intro_para">Nihilism holds that there is no meaning or value anywhere. Questions about purpose, ethics, and sacredness are unanswerable because they are meaningless. You might as well ask about the sleep habits of colorless green ideas as about the meaning of life.</p>

(For an introduction, see “<a href="#chap3">Preview: eternalism and nihilism</a>.”) However, the two stances are not simply opposites; they share fundamental metaphysical assumptions.</p>
<p>Eternalism and nihilism both fail to recognize that <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">real</a>” meaning would be absolutely patterned: perfectly definite and certain, unchanging and objective. This is their shared metaphysical error. </p>
<p>Eternalism insists that meaning really is like that. That is its second metaphysical error. Nihilism observes, accurately, that no such meaning is possible. This corrects the second error. However, because nihilism shares the first error, it concludes that meaning is impossible, period. This is also wrong; <a href="/no-ultimate-meaning">nebulous meanings are “real,”↗︎︎</a> for any reasonable definition of “real.”</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Nihilism is attractive to those who have explicitly recognized, understood, and rejected eternalism’s second error: belief in <a href="/no-ultimate-meaning">ultimate meaning↗︎︎</a>. That is not easy. Nihilism is, therefore, the more intelligent stance. Or, at least, it’s a stance that tends to be adopted more often by more intelligent people. (It’s even more dysfunctional than eternalism, so we could also call it less intelligent.)</p>
<p>While most people are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'committed', 'gloss5')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up.

(Just as eternalism seems like <a href="#chap36">the only possible salvation</a> from the harmful lies of nihilism.)</p>
<p>Even if you are relatively immune to nihilism, it’s important to understand as a prototype.

[Click for details.]">confused stances</a> are modified or limited forms of nihilism. They reject particular types of meanings, rather than rejecting all meaningfulness. That makes their distortions, harms, and emotional dynamics similar to nihilism’s.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The first page in this section discusses <a href="#chap81">several obstacles</a> you must overcome to even get to nihilism. The main one is the obviousness of meaning. Even before that, you have to let go of the <a href="#chap42">hope</a> that eternalism can somehow be made to work. There are also strong social and cultural taboos against nihilism. Finally, nihilism has nasty psychological side-effects that make you miserable.</p>
<p>The <a href="/accomplishing-nihilism">second page↗︎︎</a> explains briefly what it would mean to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'accomplish', 'gloss10')" title="“Accomplishing” a stance means adopting it consistently whenever its dimension of meaningness comes up.  This is difficult and rare; perhaps psychologically impossible. [Click for details.]">accomplish</a> nihilism: a state of total apathy. This would, theoretically, end suffering (which is one reason nihilism is attractive). It’s probably impossible, although some religious systems seem to advocate it.</p>
<p>Most of my discussion of nihilism concerns its emotional dynamics. I begin with an analogy: eternalism is <a href="#chap83">like one of those email scams</a> that promises you millions of dollars in exchange for help getting money out of Nigeria. If you fall for that, catastrophic financial loss ensues. </p>
<p>Nihilism entails a similar catastrophic loss: the loss of meaning. The <a href="#chap84">next page</a> gives an overview of our psychological reactions to that loss: <a href="#chap85">rage</a>, <a href="#chap86">intellectual argument</a>, <a href="#chap87">depression</a>, and <a href="#chap88">anxiety</a>. Each gets its own, more detailed page.</p>
<p>In addition, I address the <em>content</em> of nihilistic intellectualization. This is a collection of reasons for rejecting obvious meanings as “<a href="/no-ultimate-meaning">not really meaningful↗︎︎</a>.” They are supposedly the wrong kind of meaning; not ultimate, not objective, not eternal, not inherent, or not higher. So what? These arguments are bogus and nonsensical. They usually conceal a hidden motivation: the issue is not <em>qualitative</em> (the “wrong kind” of meaning) but <em>quantitative</em> (available meanings seem inadequately compelling). This is a psychological and practical problem, not a philosophical one, so psychological and practical methods may help.</p>
<p>The <a href="/nihilism-antidotes">antidotes to nihilism↗︎︎</a> are partly intellectual: realizing why it’s incorrect and harmful. Mainly, though, antidotes restore meaningfulness, by making it more powerful, more obvious, more compelling, more enjoyable.</p>

<p>I hope <a href="#chap76">this chapter on nihilism</a> will be useful both to people who think they aren’t nihilists, and to people who think they are.</p>
<p>Nihilism is a thing you and I, personally, <em>do</em> sometimes. Everyone does, sometimes.</p>
<p>If nihilism were just a conceptual philosophy—something to think and talk about—you could safely ignore it. But <em>doing</em> nihilism is bad for us: bad enough that it’s worth the effort to stop. This chapter explains how.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_non">For non-nihilists: what you can learn from nihilism</h2>
<p>I will suggest to non-nihilists that understanding nihilism in detail is important. You are right to reject it: nihilism is harmful and mistaken. However, it is not an abstruse philosophical irrelevance, because <em>everyone</em> falls into nihilism at least occasionally. I’ll suggest that you may be more nihilistic than you realize, and it may be causing you more trouble than you think.</p>
<p>What is at stake here is our <a href="#chap33">understanding</a> and <a href="#chap34">control</a> over our own lives. Nihilism matters because meaning matters, and the best-known alternative ways of relating to meaning are also wrong.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_nihilists">For nihilists: this is not the usual denunciation</h2>
<p>The usual arguments against nihilism <a href="/nihilism-nonsense">are nonsense↗︎︎</a>. I will confirm that you are right to reject them. I will agree with much of what you believe about meaning, and agree that it is important. Meanings are, for example, not cosmic, eternal, or personal, and this matters.</p>
<p>Realizing that eternalism and existentialism are wrong is the main reason people try to be nihilists, which makes it a more intelligent stance.</p>
<p>However, nihilism itself—“nothing is meaningful”—is harmful and mistaken. This chapter explains why, with detailed analyses that are unlike those you have seen before.</p>
<p>I hope to persuade you that <a href="#chap81">you cannot actually be a nihilist</a>, because you are too intelligent to fully convince yourself that nothing is meaningful. However, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'committing', 'gloss4')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up.

<p>Nihilism rests mainly on a bad analogy: that meanings have definite locations, like little physical objects. A marble is either in the jar, or out of the jar. Meanings, most people assume, are either inside your head, or outside your head.</p>
<p>But meanings are not specifically located. Neither are some better-understood physical phenomena: reflections, rainbows, and mirages, for instance. At the end of this page, I’ll suggest these are better (though still imperfect) analogies for meaning.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_things">Putting meanings in things</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Rum cake" height="416" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/rum_cake_3517473_560x416.jpg" title="Rum cake" width="560"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">Soaked in meaning</figcaption></figure>
<p>A natural view is that meanings are objective: inherent in things. Consider <dfn>purpose</dfn>, for instance, one of the main <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions of meaningness', 'gloss7')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions of meaningness</a>. The purpose of a pot is cooking. The purpose of wheat is nutrition. The purpose of your stomach is digestion.</p>
<p>This is the way everyone thinks about purpose most of the time, because it’s simple and mostly works. If we left it at that, it would rarely cause problems (despite being wrong). Unfortunately, there are philosophers, who want to make up stories about how things work. So how do inherent meanings work?</p>
<p>Well, humans make things for purposes. So apparently the maker of a pot gives it its purpose. But what about natural things like wheat? Here, we need God, who created the natural things, and gave them purposes. In the Medieval worldview, all things had fixed, intrinsic purposes, according to their kind. Things not obviously useful were created by God to provide moral lessons. The pelican, for example, stabs its own breast to draw blood to feed its children:<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_zpt8tlh" id="extra29_footnoteref2_zpt8tlh" title="Or so it was believed. Presumably no one has ever observed a pelican doing this, but that doesn’t seem to have been a problem.">2</a> a paradigm of compassionate self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Likewise, every kind of object has an intrinsic degree of value, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being">Great Chain of Being↗︎︎</a> decreed by God.</p>
<p>On this view, God puts meanings in objects, like marbles in a jar. Or, a better analogy would be the jelly in a jelly donut: you can’t see the meaning just by looking.</p>
<p>Actually, if you cut things open, you can’t find the meaning inside. It doesn’t ooze out. So maybe meaningfulness is more like a fluid that suffuses objects. If you soak a sponge cake in rum, that invisible essence pervades the dessert, and you can’t specifically locate it—although you can taste it.</p>
<p>How does this work? God works in mysterious ways, but how exactly does a human potter put the meaning in the pot? What is this meaning made of, and where do you get it from? If a potter puts a pot-meaning into a hammer, what then? If you always use a pot to hold marbles, instead of for cooking, have you changed its inherent purpose?</p>
<p>As the scientific worldview developed, it became clear that physical objects are “just atoms and the void.” There’s no place inside objects for meanings to hide.</p>
<p>Nothing is inherently meaningful. Nihilism is quite right about that.</p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> mean everything is inherently meaningless! Meanings are not a sort of thing that can be inherent, because they have no specific location. As we shall see.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_minds">Putting meanings in minds</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Fortune cookie: Zhuangzi say, meanings not in your head" height="375" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/fortune_cookie_not_representations_6840641_560x375.jpg" title="Fortune cookie: Zhuangzi say, meanings not in your head" width="560"/></figure>
<p>A potter cannot put a purpose in a pot; but the potter <em>knows</em> the purpose of the pot. Perhaps the purpose is inside the potter, not the pot. The potter can explain the purpose of pots to their users, and then it lives inside them too.</p>
<p>Probably in their heads. Like marbles. Although, if you cut open people’s heads, you can’t find any.</p>
<p>So, we invented “minds,” which are metaphysical jars for putting meanings in. Despite being immaterial, the mind is also somehow in the head. Maybe it’s one of those subtle fluids, which pervades the brain, like rum.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_3a4okz0" id="extra29_footnoteref3_3a4okz0" title="The mental fluid idea goes back at least as far as Galen, in the second century AD, who called it “psychic pneuma.” Descartes promoted a similar model of “animal spirits”: “a fine wind, or lively and pure flame.” That was highly influential, although conceptually incoherent and anatomically ignorant even for his day. Maybe no one believes this theory now, but it’s still a common way of thinking. For instance, explanations of the extended mind theory are commonly misunderstood as promoting some sort of ectoplasm that oozes out of your skull and goes on astral adventures.">3</a></p>
<p>The problem with putting meanings in people’s heads is that people disagree. If meanings were in objects, we could resolve conflicts by determining the objective truth. But disagreement is fatal for all subjective accounts of meaning. This is most obvious in ethics. If I consider eating people OK and you consider it morally wrong, and if what it <em>means</em> to be right or wrong is nothing other than our opinions, then we cannot even begin a discussion. We cannot state any reasons, and there is no way to change someone’s mind. (How would this work in educating children? “Stop biting your sister!” “Subjectively, it is right for me to do so.”)</p>
<p>So, we could put the marbles in God’s head. His job was to keep track of all the meanings for us; and it was jolly decent of him to work so hard at it. Sadly, after a protracted illness, he died <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead">in the 1880s↗︎︎</a>. A series of attempts to construct other <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principles', 'gloss8')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.

The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principles</a>, as replacement meaning-keeping golems, all failed.</p>
<p>Since God joined the choir invisible, most people have held individualistic, subjective theories of meaning.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_2gl5kpd" id="extra29_footnoteref4_2gl5kpd" title="Many religious people do commit to the marbles-in-the-mind-of-God theory, of course. I gather that living in a predominantly secular culture makes this difficult to maintain consistently, however. Slipping into a relativist, subjective view is a constant danger.">4</a> Two popular ones are <dfn>existentialism</dfn> and the <dfn>representational theory of mind</dfn>.</p>
<p><a href="#chap89">Existentialism</a> says you have to craft your own marbles by hand. It’s frightfully important that yours be different from everyone else’s. You must be creative and artistic and intuitive when making your very own meanings. Also, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantically rebellious', 'gloss10')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">romantically rebellious</a> and resolute and heroic and stuff. Unfortunately, this project proves impossible: at most, a tiny fraction of personal meanings can be distinctive.</p>
<p>The <a href="#chap106">representational theory of mind</a> says that meanings are like little slips of paper, with the meanings written on them, that live in your head. A cookie fortune is meaningful if you can read it and what it says creates a new relationship between you and the world. Who reads the meanings in your head? How do they create relationships? It takes <a href="#chap106">a billion tiny spooks</a> to do that.</p>
<p>If you are a nihilist, you have understood—correctly—that subjective theories of meaning cannot work. Subjective meaning is none at all.</p>
<p>If you believe in a subjective theory, you may balk at that claim. I’ll give detailed arguments later in the book. Few of those are new or likely to surprise you, though. Subjectivism appears plausible only when it seems the least bad of the three bad alternatives.</p>
<p>So, you may be better persuaded by explanations of how meaning can be <em>neither objective nor subjective</em>, but interactive. Like… a rainbow.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rainbow">Like a rainbow</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Photographer with rainbow" height="392" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/rainbow_photographer_13529213_560x392.jpg" title="Photographer with rainbow" width="560"/></figure>
<p>A rainbow is a three-way interaction among the sun, water droplets, and an observer.</p>
<p>A rainbow is a physical phenomenon, but not a physical object. It has no specific location. Two observers standing a hundred feet apart will see “the rainbow” in different places. If you drive toward a rainbow, it appears to recede just as fast, so you can never get to it.</p>
<p>Rainbows are pretty fully understood, and guaranteed 100% metaphysics-free.</p>
<p>Although an observer is necessarily involved, a rainbow is not subjective. It is not “mental,” not an illusion, and does not depend on any magical properties of brains. The observer can just as well be a camera.</p>
<p>The rainbow is not in your head, or in the camera. But it is also not an object-out-there. It is not in the mist, and not in the sun, although both are required for a rainbow to occur.</p>
<p>A rainbow is not “objective” in the sense of “inherent in an object.” It <em>is</em> “objective” in a different sense: the presence of a rainbow is publicly verifiable. Rational, unbiased observers will generally agree about whether or not there is a rainbow.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_iy8hzm4" id="extra29_footnoteref5_iy8hzm4" title="Later, I’ll explain how nihilism and eternalism exploit such ambiguities in “objective” and “subjective” to render plausible reasoning that would otherwise seem plainly false.">5</a></p>
<p>To make the analogy explicit, meanings:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>are interactions among people and circumstances</li>
<li>are physical phenomena, but not physical objects</li>
<li>have no definite locations (whether inside or outside heads)</li>
<li>are observer-relative, to varying extents</li>
<li>are usually well-understood, and 100% metaphysics-free</li>
<li>are mostly not subjective, mental, illusory, or dependent on magical properties of brains</li>
<li>are not inherent in objects</li>
<li>mostly <em>are</em> publicly verifiable, so reasonable observers mostly agree about them</li>
</ul>
<p>This analogy makes plausible the claim that meanings can be non-objective, non-subjective, and existent. That is good enough for this chapter, because nihilism mostly seems plausible only if you accept the forced choice among objectivity, subjectivity, and non-existence.</p>
<p>In nearly every other way, meanings are unlike rainbows, so it’s important not to take the analogy literally. One important difference is that a rainbow’s observer (whether animate or artificial) is mainly passive.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_wy6w319" id="extra29_footnoteref6_wy6w319" title="Although, perception is actually an active process. This turns out to be important in understanding how meaningness does work, and I’ll come back to it in the discussion of objects and boundaries later.">6</a> Observation does not affect the sun or mist. Meanings are activities, in which causality typically runs in all directions.</p>
<p>Rainbows once seemed magical, mysterious, and metaphysical. Now we have a pretty complete understanding of them. Meanings may now seem magical, mysterious, or metaphysical. They’re more complicated than rainbows—but I think we can gain a pretty complete understanding of them too.</p>
<p>I will replace the rainbow analogy with much more detailed and accurate explanations later. These too draw on physical analogs, such as the chaotic pendulum; but mainly on observing meanings directly. As background, the explanations require considerable conceptual machinery that will be unfamiliar to most readers, but fortunately that is not necessary for this chapter.</p>

This meaning is not merely subjective, at least not in the sense that it’s just in your head. Your cat finds food meaningful, too. If you failed to feed your cat for long enough, it might seriously reevaluate your relationship, and there would be consequences. Your spouse might have something to say, too.</p>
<p>Hardcore nihilism insists that, no, actually, you had no purpose in going to the store. The supposed purpose was an illusion. There are no purposes <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>This is basically just silly, and motivated only by stubbornness. I don’t believe anyone actually holds hardcore nihilism, although some people do try to argue for it publicly. It is a fallback position when you get backed into a corner by someone pointing out that, obviously, many things <em>are</em> meaningful; yet you want to continue to claim to be a nihilist. It’s logically consistent in a way that (as we’ll see) lite nihilism is not; but it requires defiance of all sense and evidence.</p>
<p>Attempts to justify it involve elaborate intellectual obfuscation: sophistical, scientistical, pseudo-rational fallacies. I’ll cover these in later, in “<a href="/190-proof-nihilism">190-proof nihilism: intoxicating intellectual idiocy↗︎︎</a>.”</p>
<h2 id="extra29_lite">Nihilism Lite™</h2>
<p>Lite nihilism grants the obvious, that some things are meaningful “in some trivial sense,” but insists that they are not “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss3')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>” meaningful. The kinds of meaning that would actually matter don’t exist, so you might as well just kill yourself.</p>
<p>So you may agree that going to the supermarket was slightly meaningful, in some uninteresting sense; but you hasten to add that this does <em>not</em> imply that Life has an Ultimate Cosmic Meaning, or anything like that! Which is entirely correct. However, it is a <em>different</em> claim from “nothing means anything.”</p>
<p>Lite nihilism starts from the intelligent recognition that the kinds of meaning claimed by <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss4')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a> indeed do not exist. For example, meanings are not inherent, or eternal, or perfectly definite or <a href="#chap32">certain</a>. That means that the <a href="#chap31">seductive promises</a> of eternalism are <a href="#chap37">harmful lies</a>. It cannot deliver the benefits of total <a href="#chap33">understanding</a> and <a href="#chap34">control</a> that it advertises.</p>
<p>Lite nihilism’s error is the implication that the kinds of meaning that do exist are all trivial and inadequate. This conclusion is rarely (if ever) spelled out in detail. The typical pattern is to jump from “meanings don’t last forever” to “so everything is worthless,” without explanation. There is a powerful <em>emotional</em> logic to this, but is it correct? What exactly is wrong with non-eternal meanings?</p>
<p>What kinds of meaning do exist, once eternalistic delusions are stripped away? For what purposes, and in what ways, are they inadequate—if they are? These questions deserve careful investigation.</p>
<p>The distinction between 190-proof nihilism and the lite version is rarely made explicit, so we tend to switch between them as needed to make nihilism seem plausible. We can slide from “nothing is inherently meaningful” to “nothing is meaningful” without noticing we’re doing that. In fact, we do that deliberately, to pull the wool over our own eyes.</p>
<p>The <a href="#chap79">promise of nihilism</a> is “you don’t have to care.” This works only if there is no meaning at all. You obviously <em>do</em> care about feeding the cat, so only if that is negated could nihilism deliver any benefit. If you admitted mundane matters like cat food are meaningful, you’d effectively transition from nihilism to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss5')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>. Materialism’s promises and emotional dynamics are quite different. The circumstances in which materialism seems attractive are not the ones in which nihilism is attractive, so you may want to avoid the switch.</p>
<p>So the idea here is to trick yourself into thinking that arguments for lite nihilism (or even materialism) are really arguments for full-strength nihilism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_2sxpjxq" id="extra29_footnoteref1_2sxpjxq" title="This is an instance of the “motte and bailey” pattern of fallacious rhetoric. Usually rhetoric is designed to convince other people, but nihilism is mostly something you try to convince yourself of.">1</a></p>
<p>In “<a href="/no-ultimate-meaning">Why is Lite Nihilism mistaken↗︎︎</a>,” I go through various properties that eternalism claims meaning has, and which lite nihilism rejects. (For example, meanings are not eternal, ultimate, or God-given.) For each, I explain why we should not be upset about meaning not working that way.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_miserabilism">Miserabilism</h2>
<p>By “miserabilism” I mean the view that everything is awful.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_kdykhc4" id="extra29_footnoteref2_kdykhc4" title="I have given “miserabilism” this meaning by fiat for the purpose of this book. The word is not widely used and doesn’t seem to have a clear definition. “Pessimism” is often used for everything-is-awful-ism in philosophy, but the everyday meaning of “pessimism” is restricted to the future. Miserabilism is about the present (or near future, as opposed to the long term).">2</a> Thinking that everything is awful is depressing, and depression frequently leads to nihilism. Nihilism also <a href="#chap84">leads to depression</a>, and depression leads to thinking that everything is awful, so all three of these support each other. In experience, “everything is awful” and “everything is meaningless” <em>feel</em> similar, and they usually come at the same time.</p>
<p>However, “everything is awful” is actually an entirely different statement from “everything is meaningless.” In fact they are incompatible, because “awful” is a value judgment—a meaning—and nihilism <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denies', 'gloss6')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.

Nevertheless, I’ll <a href="#chap87">discuss miserabilism further</a> in the section on nihilistic depression.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_materialism">Materialism</h2>
<p>The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialistic', 'gloss8')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related.

[Click for details.]">stance</a>, which rejects “higher” meanings but affirms mundane purposes, is often described as “nihilistic.” Materialism does not meet the book’s definition of “nihilism”—denial of all meanings—but it does have some of the same emotional dynamics.

<p>Still, materialism is different enough from nihilism that I devote <a href="#chap114">a separate chapter</a> to it.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_existentialism">Existentialism</h2>
<p>I use “existentialism” to mean the idea that meanings must be subjective because they are not objective.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_lbra641" id="extra29_footnoteref3_lbra641" title="“Existentialism” is not a precisely-defined term. The way I’m using it here may not be “standard,” but it’s roughly in-line with some traditional uses.">3</a> Then you could either say that subjective meanings are just fine, so there’s no problem; or you could say that subjective meanings are no damn good, so everything is awful.</p>
<p>The “no damn good” conclusion makes existentialism into a branch of Nihilism Lite™. This is what historically happened to existentialism as a cultural movement in the mid-20th century. As existentialists worked out the implications of a subjective theory of meaning, it looked increasingly inadequate and unworkable and led to individual and group rage, intellectual pretentiousness, depression, and angst—the four emotional characteristics of nihilism. As a movement, existentialism collapsed half a century ago.</p>
<p>Many intelligent non-philosophers accept the premise that meaning must be subjective, but don’t see why this should be a problem, and advocate an optimistic existentialism. This stance is rare among academic philosophers.</p>
<p>I think a subjective theory of meaning cannot, in fact, be made to work. Existentialism collapsed for good reasons. The subjective theory of meaning is factually wrong, and trying seriously to make it work leads to nihilism inevitably.</p>
<p><cite>Meaningness</cite> develops <a href="#chap27">an understanding of meaning</a> as <a href="#chap110">neither objective nor subjective</a>. Detailed explanation has to be postponed to much later in the book, but there’s a <a href="#chap89">preliminary analysis of existentialism</a> right after I finish with nihilism.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_complete">The complete stance (“Joyful nihilism”)</h2>
<p>Above, I asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of meaning do exist, once eternalistic delusions are stripped away? For what purposes, and in what ways, are they inadequate—if they are?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book, <cite>Meaningness</cite>, could be summarized as an investigation into these questions. It suggests that meaningness is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>, which accounts for what’s right in nihilism’s rejection of eternalist meaning. It suggests also that meaningness is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterned', 'gloss12')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterned</a>: real, concrete, and functional. These patterns are adequate; the nebulosity of meaningness does not imply there is anything wrong with the universe. We can’t get the kinds of meaning some may want, but we can get the kinds we need. Certainty is not possible, but knowledge is; total control is not possible, but strong influence is; complete understanding is not possible, but incrementally better ones are.</p>
<p>Since the complete stance agrees with lite nihilism’s analysis and rejection of eternalism, it might be considered a species of nihilism by some. In fact, I sometimes think of it as “joyful nihilism”—although it strongly disagrees with nihilism’s central claim that “nothing means anything.”</p>
<p>Going through that analysis in detail takes one a fair way toward explaining the complete stance. Upcoming pages will explain why lite nihilism is right to reject eternalism’s characterization of meanings as objective, eternal, inherent, ultimate, and so forth; but wrong to insist that meanings that lack these properties are no good. Accepting both parts of that is tantamount to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'adopting', 'gloss13')" title="“Adopting” a stance means using its pattern of feeling and thinking to address the dimension of meaningness it relates to.

<p><a href="#chap83">On the last page</a>, I compared
eternalism with the Nigerian “419” fraud.  Many retired people have lost their
entire life savings to this spam-based scam.  They face the same set
of emotional reactions we have to any other catastrophic loss, such as 
a divorce following infidelity: <i>denial, anger, arguing, depression, anxiety,</i>

<p>On this page, I’ll explain briefly the dynamics of these reactions
to loss of faith in eternalism.  Then I’ll devote a full page to each
strategy separately.</p>
<h2>Denial: wavering eternalism</h2>
<p>One’s first reaction to recognizing the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

[Click for details.]">meaningness</a> is to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'deny', 'gloss4')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense. [Click for details.]">deny</a> it.  On some level, you realize that not everything has a definite meaning; that eternalism is false.  But since that seems too awful to contemplate, you refuse to admit it.  You redouble your insistence that everything is <em>peachy keen</em>—and prepare to do violence to anyone and anything that contradicts you.</p>
<p>This is <em><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'wavering', 'gloss5')" title="When you have committed to a stance, but have not accomplished it, then you are “wavering.”  Wavering means that you are trying to adopt a stance consistently, but are finding it difficult or impossible to do so. [Click for details.]">wavering</a></em> eternalism. You try to maintain the eternalist stance using <a href="#chap38">ploys</a> such as <a href="#chap46">kitsch</a>, <a href="#chap47">arming</a>, and <a href="#chap53">mystification</a>.  These are not nihilistic strategies; but they can easily flip into nihilism, when nebulosity becomes so obvious that <a href="#chap43">pretending</a> becomes impossible.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rage">Anger</h2>
<p>Nihilism is a simple inversion of eternalism.  It denies that there anything is meaningful at all.  At times when meaning is particularly evanescent, when you are particularly bitterly disappointed in it, you may <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'commitment', 'gloss6')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up. [Click for details.]">commit</a> to nihilism.  “I’ll <em>never</em> get fooled again!”</p>
<p>But this commitment is difficult—probably impossible.  <a href="#chap25">Meaningfulness is, at other times, obvious.</a>  As a result, in practice all nihilism is <em>wavering</em> nihilism.</p>
<p>Whereas wavering eternalism consists of eternalism plus secret doubt,
wavering nihilism consists of nihilism plus secret passion.  Passion is the
recognition of meaningfulness.  To maintain wavering nihilism, you must
blind yourselves to meaningfulness, which is even more difficult than blinding
yourselves to the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of meaning.</p>
<p>Rage is one way wavering nihilism reacts to evidence of
meaningfulness.  This is a defiant negativity: “I <em>don’t care!</em>
No matter what you say, I will <em>not</em> admit life is meaningful!”
Nihilistic rage wants to destroy whatever has meaning, and whoever
points to meaning.  (This is the mirror-image strategy to <a href="#chap47">armed
eternalism</a>.)</p>
<p>I mentioned that the people most prone to nihilism are sociopaths,
intellectuals, and depressives.  These are the people best able to
deploy the corresponding approaches of rage, argument, and depression.
Almost everyone <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'adoption', 'gloss8')" title="“Adopting” a stance means using its pattern of feeling and thinking to address the dimension of meaningness it relates to.  Often one adopts a stance only momentarily, and typically without noticing it. [Click for details.]">adopts</a> all these strategies at times,
however.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_intellectualization">Arguing with reality</h2>
<p>Eternalism uses willful stupidity to not-see nebulosity.  Realizing
that you have been duped, and seeing through eternalism’s lies, is
intelligent. Mostly, only unusually smart people explicitly commit to
nihilism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_ae36fky" id="extra29_footnoteref2_ae36fky" title="This is a generalization, of course.  It is possible to make brilliant conceptual arguments in favor of eternalism (usually in defense of a system, such as an eternalist religion or political ideology).  There are probably also stupid people who commit to nihilism (although I have not come across one).">2</a></p>
<p>Smart people are used to using clever arguments to get what they
want.  So it is natural to apply intellectual brilliance to the
difficult task of maintaining wavering nihilism, to fight its greatest
obstacle: the obviousness of meaningfulness.  Nihilistic
intellectualization is the counterpart to <a href="#chap46">eternalist
kitsch</a>: calm insistence on plainly false claims.</p>
<p>Somehow meaningfulness must be explained away by conceptual
sleight-of-hand.  A theory that proves “nothing is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss10')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>
meaningful”—in which “really” is the gate to a hell writhing with
logical demons—can distract you from the obvious.</p>
<p>This theory has to get complicated quickly in order to be
sufficiently confusing, or seem so insightful as to dazzle you into
submission.  Typically, nihilistic intellectualization involves
extreme abstraction, voluminous intricacy, sesquipedalian diction,
non-standard logic, and often reflexivity (meta-level analysis).
These insulate the argument from checking against everyday
experience.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_ohlfed3" id="extra29_footnoteref3_ohlfed3" title="Nihilistic intellectualization is characteristic of postmodernist thought.  I will have much more to say about postmodernism later in the book.">3</a></p>
<p>Because nihilistic intellectualization is often colored by its
sister-strategies of anger or depression, it is often aggressive,
hostile, cynical, or pessimistic; whereas eternalistic justifications
are typically cloying, simpering, naïve, and Pollyanna-ish.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_depression">Depression</h2>
<p>Realizing that eternalism will always fail often results in
anguish, pessimism, depression, stoicism, alienation, apathy, 
exhaustion, and paralysis.</p>
<p>The loss of guaranteed meaningfulness is a real one, and it is
natural to feel sad about it.  Depression goes beyond spontaneous
sadness, however.  It is active and deliberate—although it feels
passive and externally imposed.</p>
<p>Nihilistic depression suppresses the feelings (positive and
negative) that go with recognition of meaning.  Depression can be
thought of as rage turned inward.  It tries to kill your passionate
response to reality.</p>
<p>Depression copes with loss by lowering the stakes.  It wants to
disengage from problems of meaning by refusing to admit that they are
important.  If nothing is really meaningful, then the loss of meaning

<h2>Acceptance</h2>
<p>Acceptance of <em>both</em> <a href="#chap25">meaninglessness and meaningfulness</a> is the way out of nihilism, and into the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss12')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

<p>One has to fully allow the emotional loss that comes with the
collapse of eternalism.  The pain of loss is real and cannot be
destroyed, talked away, or minimized (as the nihilistic coping strategies
attempt to do).  You have to admit that you <em>do</em> care, that the
world <em>is</em> meaningful, so the stakes are high.  But you also
have to learn to turn away from eternalism’s alluring promise to
remove the pain by restoring fixed meanings.</p>
<p><a href="#chap9">Conceptual understanding of nebulosity</a> is
probably required.  Until you understand how meaningfulness and
meaninglessness coexist, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss13')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness.

obvious.  The complete stance remains invisible until you learn the
sideways move to nebulosity.  Nebulosity allows the coexistence of
pain and joy, and reveals the benefits of meaninglessness.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the past 10 years, some interesting new defences of nihilism have arisen that merit careful consideration. According to one rationale, for our lives to matter, we must in a position to add value to the world, which we are not since the value of the world is already infinite (Smith 2003). The key premises for this view are that every bit of space-time (or at least the stars in the physical universe) have some positive value, that these values can be added up, and that space is infinite. If the physical world at present contains an infinite degree of value, nothing we do can make a difference in terms of meaning, for infinity plus any amount of value must be infinity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nihilistic anxiety is also called <dfn>existential angst</dfn>.</p>
<p>Nihilistic anxiety is pervasive; it is not about anything in particular.</p>
<p>Not being able to make sense of specific things naturally causes anxiety about them, because of uncertainty. Not being able to make sense of <em>anything</em>—a consequence of nihilism—causes non-specific, pervasive anxiety.</p>
<p>The underlying worry is that our perception of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

<p>“Cosmic horror” fiction—such as Lovecraft’s Cthulhu stories—express nihilistic anxiety. They convey the feeling that everything is horrible and doomed, without making any actual sense. As I’ve written elsewhere, this is <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/lovecraft-harman-nihilism">silly↗︎︎</a> (although fun if you don’t take them seriously).</p>
<p>Actually, in nihilistic anxiety and depression, everything shows up as existent but meaningless, and therefore silly.  This includes oneself. In existentialism, this is called “The Absurd.”</p>

The assumption is that meanings can be localized inside things. Eternalism supposes the meaning of an object is inherent in it (and external to us), so it is objective. Nihilism (correctly) points out that meanings cannot be inherent, and (wrongly) concludes that they cannot exist.</p>
<p>Existentialism supposes the meaning lives inside your head (so it is subjective, internal, and individual). This is also wrong. I will explain later why meanings logically <em>can’t</em> be subjective. They also can’t be individual: they are inherently social. Also, we don’t have perfectly free will to choose meanings. We are constrained by, and unavoidably depend upon, biology and society and culture.</p>
<p>If you try to maintain the illusion that existentialism is possible, you will probably end up adopting the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'True Self', 'gloss6')" title='The “deep" or “true” or “authentic” self is an imaginary, inaccessible superior identity, which has a magical connection with the Cosmic Plan.  “Depth psychology” is particularly big on the true self, but this confused idea has become wide-spread.

<p>If you seriously attempt existentialism, you will fail. You cannot create your own meanings. If you take that failure seriously, and analyze what went wrong, you may recognize that subjective meanings are impossible. Then—since objective meanings are also clearly impossible—you will end up in nihilism.</p>
<p>The way out is to recognize that meaningness is <a href="#chap110">neither subjective nor objective</a>. It is a collaborative accomplishment of dynamic interaction. One might say that it lives in the space-between subject and object; or that it pervades the situation in which it manifests, including both subject and object.

<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_already">You are already in the complete stance</h2>
<p>From its own point of view, the complete stance is simpler than either eternalism or nihilism. It sees only one thing (meaningness) not two (meaning and meaninglessness). It does not attempt to divide pattern from nebulosity—an artificial and impossible separation that causes endless complications.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="#chap26">always obvious</a> that meaningness is both nebulous and patterned. This means that the complete stance is also obviously right.</p>
<p>Because it is obviously right, we are all always already in the complete stance.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_boring">The complete stance looks boring from a distance</h2>
<p>The road to the complete stance appears dull, at first, because it is obvious. The way is deflationary: it strips away the enticing dramas of the confused stances:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Eternalism</dt>
<dd>“You are on a <a href="#chap113">Mission</a> from God to fulfill the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss10')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Ultimate Meaning of the Universe</a>!”</dd>
<dt>Nihilism</dt>
<dd>“You have seen through the illusion of meaning and joined the <a href="#chap80">intellectual elite</a> who recognize the hard and cold reality of Ultimate Meaninglessness!”</dd>
<dt>Existentialism</dt>
<dd>“You have thrown off the fetters of mindless social conformity, and have the courage to create your own meanings out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671867806/?tag=meaningness-20">raw nothingness↗︎︎</a>!”</dd>
</dl>
<p>We manufacture these dramas because we fear that actually-existing meanings <a href="/no-ultimate-meaning">are inadequate↗︎︎</a>. But—exciting, colorful, and appealing as fantasy-meanings may be—they are imposed, delusional, and noxious. We are better off without them.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_freedom">Freedom from metaphysical delusions</h2>
<p>The negative definition of the complete stance, as not fixating or denying meaning, is unappealing. However, it points to the main promise: freedom. Freedom from metaphysical delusions, and their propensity to limit action.</p>
<p>The shared metaphysical error underlying eternalism and nihilism is that the only meaningful kind of meaning would be non-nebulous: objective, eternal, distinct, changeless, and unambiguous. Recognizing that meanings are never that way, yet real all the same, is a more positive definition of the complete stance.</p>
<p>This chapter will begin to answer the question “<em>how</em> can meaning be nebulous and yet patterned?”—although bits of explanation will be scattered through the rest of the book. Partly that is because various seemingly-disparate and unfamiliar concepts are necessary as background, and I introduce those only gradually.</p>
<p>Mainly, however, “how” is not the point. This book is not academic philosophy. <cite><a href="/">Meaningness</a></cite> aims to be a practical guide to working with meaning, not an abstract treatise attempting to explain it. Practically speaking, what is necessary is to recognize <em>that</em> meaningness is nebulous yet patterned, not to understand exactly how that can be.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_stabilizing">Finding, stabilizing, and accomplishing the complete stance</h2>
<p>We may begin by asking:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is creative, but not eternalistic?<br/>What is realistic, but not nihilistic?</p></blockquote>
<p>Dropping attractive delusions is the antidote to eternalism. Allowing meanings to <em>be as they are</em> is the antidote to nihilism. Then you discover that meaningness is adequate after all—<em>more</em> than adequate—wondrous, delicious, and vivid!</p>
<p>If we are always already in the complete stance, are we already done?  No. The aim is to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stabilize', 'gloss11')" title="Stances toward meaningness are inherently unstable, because they fail to fit reality or are emotionally unattractive.

<h2 id="extra29_monism">Monism</h2>

It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.

Typically, monists say that the universe is equivalent to God, so you are actually also God. As you realize everything is totally connected, you develop the ability to affect anything you want.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate fantasy of power and invulnerability. However, convincing yourself that you are All-powerful, when you aren’t, does not make your life go well.</p>
<p>When the fantasy collides with reality, monists retreat into a make-believe magical world. Monism produces dreamy spaciness, refusal to make any clear distinctions, refusal to judge. This leads to drifting through life, expecting other people to clean up your messes, contributing nothing except spiritual clichés mouthed at unwanted times.</p>
<p>As a social ideology, monism tends toward totalitarian denial of individuality.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_dualism">Dualism</h2>
<p>The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss5')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<p>The fantasy of dualism is that a clear separation between you and others frees you from their contaminating influence, and from responsibility to the world.</p>
<p>Dualism, by blinding you to connections, makes it easy to evade ethical responsibility for consequences. Psychologically, it produces alienation from the natural world, from other people, and from the sacred. As a social ideology, dualism tends toward denial of collective responsibility.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_dualism">The monism within dualism</h2>
<p>All boundaries are somewhat vague. This is true of physical boundaries, and of abstract category boundaries. Sometimes you cannot say on which side of the boundary something falls—not for lack of knowledge, but because there is no right or wrong answer. This is intolerable for dualism.</p>
<p>Confronted with this nebulosity, dualism tries to harden the boundary by putting everything clearly on one side or the other. How? What defines a boundary? Everything <em>inside</em> the boundary is one way, and everything <em>outside</em> is the other way. Dualism exaggerates the commonality of everything inside, and the commonality of everything outside. It forces a choice onto items near the boundary, which must conform to one criterion or the other.</p>
<p>Dualism thereby imposes an impression of homogeneity. Everything inside is, ideally, exactly the same, and perfectly connected to everything else within. Everything outside is also exactly the same. So, on either side of the boundary, dualism turns into monism!</p>
<p>This dynamic is closely related to <dfn>essentialism</dfn>, which is a typical strategy for justifying the equivalence of the apparently dissimilar. “These two might <em>look</em> different,” essentialism says, “but they are <em>essentially</em> the same.” The “essence” is an invisible, magic, indwelling property that dualism claims explains the commonality, but that cannot be detected by any ordinary means.</p>
<p>Particularly harmful examples of monism-within-dualism are found in ideologies governing social groups. (Religions, political orientations, and ethnicities are typical examples.) The group presses its members all to be the same; to be <em>our kind</em> of person. Everyone outside is treated as interchangeably the <em>wrong kind</em>. The ideology has no room for anyone near the border. It does not accept that people on either side vary among themselves. The amount of pressure for conformity, and for rejection of outsiders, is a measure of how pathologically dualistic the group’s functioning is.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_monism">The dualism within monism</h2>
<p>Confronted with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterns', 'gloss9')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterns</a> of distinction, monism attempts to force universal homogeneity. Sameness is good; difference is bad. Pointing to unity is holy; pointing to distinctions is materialistic selfishness.</p>
<p>Everything and everyone is included within the One. The One is All. Anything that appears not to be included must be assimilated. Anything that cannot get fitted into the One is wrong and must be destroyed.</p>
<p>To see that everything is totally connected is enlightenment. To misunderstand things as separate is the root of all evil.</p>
<p>There must be no differences in value; everything and everyone is equal. Nothing is better than anything else. You must accept this. Claims of inequalities are discrimination; prejudice; intolerance. We must not allow intolerance; that is absolutely unacceptable. Intolerant people are ignorant and inferior.</p>
<p>In sum: when monism encounters a difference it cannot ignore, it turns into dualism—often a particularly absolutist and pathological dualism.</p>
<p>Some “spiritual” ideologies are the clearest examples of monism. They can be highly intolerant of anyone recognizing distinctions they deny, or rejecting imaginary connections they fixate. They may denounce non-believers as “scientistic materialists,” for example. As everyone knows, scientistic materialism is responsible for war, capitalist exploitation, the ecological rape of the planet, chemtrails, and vaccine-induced autism. None of those awful things would be allowed if everyone realized everything was connected.</p>
<p>Monist religions are exceptionally evangelical, pursuing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish">embrace, extend, extinguish↗︎︎</a> strategy. <dfn>Perennialism</dfn> is the claim that all religions are essentially the same. Specifically, they are essentially the same as monism. We should accept and include all religions, as different paths to the same Truth. Christianity, for example. Essentially, the message of Christianity is that you should emulate Jesus. Jesus is essentially God, who is essentially The One that is All. You emulate by realizing your essential sameness. So, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss10')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>, the aim of Christianity is to discover that you are God, who is The Entire Universe.</p>
<p>This is a dire distortion of Christianity, which is a dualistic religion. None of Christianity—sin, salvation, the afterlife—makes any sense if you are “really” God. Nevertheless, many supposed Christians have converted to monism without noticing, and are unable to see any difference between the two. Monism, extolling tolerance, begins by saying that Christianity is totally true, but it eventually explains that old fashioned Christians <em>are doing it wrong</em>, because the “real” Christianity is actually monism. Christianity is only true insofar as it is monism.</p>
<p>Monism uses the same embrace-extend-extinguish strategy against Buddhism. Centuries ago, monist proponents of Hinduism “benevolently included” Buddhism as a “totally valid branch” of the greatly diverse tree of Hinduism. Then they insisted that everything about it was not quite right and must, step by step, be replaced with Hinduism. This was part of the reason Buddhism went extinct in India. In the past few decades, “<a href="#extra11">spiritual but not religious</a>” monism has infected modern Buddhism and mostly eaten it from within. It will be interesting to see how long Islam—perhaps the most dualistic of all religions—can withstand this virulent pathogen.</p>
<p>Egalitarian political ideologies also can fall into the intolerant monism that is dualistic in its approach to opponents. This is the pattern of “political correctness,” which says that everyone must be included, all beliefs must be accepted, and everyone is perfectly equal. Except for people who are not politically correct. They must be cast out. Their beliefs are unacceptable and must be silenced. They are ethically inferior; that’s their essential and permanent nature, and no amount of repentance and purification can redeem them.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_boundary">The boundary between sameness and difference is nebulous yet patterned</h2>
<p>Monism and dualism are mirror-image attempts to separate sameness and difference.</p>
<p>This is typical of confused stances, which <a href="#chap12">come in pairs</a> of apparent opposites. Each pair shares an underlying, unrecognized mistaken metaphysical assumption. The confused opposition can be resolved by making the assumption explicit, understanding why it is wrong, and replacing it.</p>
<p>The metaphysical assumption shared by monism and dualism is that boundaries must be perfectly <a href="#chap10">solid, objective, eternal, clear, and definite</a>. Monism recognizes, accurately, that there are no completely hard boundaries—but then wrongly denies that there are any differences at all. Dualism recognizes, accurately, that distinctions are important—but then wrongly fixates them.</p>
<p>All boundaries are somewhat nebulous; yet the patterning of the world implies that boundaries are everywhere. </p>
<p>There is never a perfectly definite fact-of-the-matter as to whether two things are the same or distinct. Any two things are somewhat different and somewhat similar; somewhat separated and somewhat connected. Understanding and acting on this is the complete stance, participation. It is “complete” in recognizing both sameness and difference, separation and connection.</p>
<p>I have used the yin/yang symbol, at the top of this page, to illustrate the pathological hard distinction between monism and dualism—the two colors in the figure. Each teardrop shape contains within it a distinct circle of the other color, which I am using to symbolize the inclusion of the opposite stance within each.</p>
<p>I know little about the Taoist philosophy in which the yin-yang symbol originated. I gather, though, that its metaphysics may approximate “participation.” In that case, the hard edges between black and white in the figure are misleading. As a symbol of participation, it would be more accurate if they shaded into each other. And not just gray between black and white. It would be more accurate, too, if the two halves of the diagram each showed contrasting but harmonious patterns of diverse colors.</p>
<p>Perhaps the ancient Chinese sages would like to commission me to redesign their sacred symbol? I haz mad graphic design skillz, and my rates can be quite reasonable on major jobs.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_further">Further reading</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1883319005/?tag=meaningness-20">The Guru Papers↗︎︎</a> presents an outstanding analysis of the pathologies of monism, its denial of differences, and its trick of turning into dualism when that fails. I have posted my notes on it <a href="#extra4">here</a>. The most relevant part starts with the note for page 303.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199915288/?tag=meaningness-20">Rethinking Pluralism: Ritual, Experience, and Ambiguity↗︎︎</a> explores the pervasive nebulosity of all categories, and analyzes the pathologies of dualism and its fixation of boundaries. The book develops methods for working effectively with ambiguities of sameness and difference, avoiding both monism and dualism.</p>
<p>Both these books are particularly concerned with pathologies of monism and dualism in political and religious groups.</p>
<p>In “<a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/19/inclusion-exclusion-unity-and-diversity/">Inclusion, exclusion, unity and diversity↗︎︎</a>” I wrote about a monist aspect of “Consensus Buddhism” (the white American Buddhist mainstream). The Consensus claims to include everyone, while deliberately excluding most Buddhists. This is a case of “dualism within monism” particularly close to home for me.</p>

<p>There is a jar of blueberry jam on my breakfast table. I could pick it up and toss it in the air and catch it. The lid is screwed on tight, so it will hold together. The jar won’t stick to the table or to my hand.</p>
<p>So, intuitively, an <dfn>object</dfn> is a bunch of bits that are <dfn>connected</dfn> together, and aren’t connected to other things. The <dfn>boundary</dfn> of the object is where the connections stop.</p>
<p>These definitions are often useful in practice. However, they also often don’t work.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Are a glass jam jar, its metal lid, and the jam itself one object, or three? It depends on what I’m doing with them. If I’m moving bottles around in the fridge, looking for the mustard, I’ll treat the jar with lid and contents as one object. That’s true even if I carelessly left the lid unscrewed and it could fall off. If you have a naked waffle and ask me to “pass the jam, please,” the jar and jam are the one object I’ll pass you—but I wouldn’t include the lid. If I’m polite, I might actually remove the lid before passing the jam.</p>
<p>And then there is the jam itself, as I stir it into my yogurt. It’s not object-like at all. It <em>will</em> stick to my hand, or to the table, if I spill a bit. It’s sticky blobby goo, with semi-squashed bits of blueberry. Are the blueberry bits separate objects or not? It’s impossible, if I poke at them, to say where their boundaries lie; they fade off indeterminately into the more liquid parts of the jam. Mixing it into the yogurt, the boundary between the two substances becomes gradually, increasingly obscure, indefinite, non-existent.</p>
<p>A cloud is a particularly dramatic example of ideas about objects not working. (That is one reason I use the word “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>” so often; it means “cloud-like-ness.”) Seen from afar, you can say that <em>this</em> cloud and <em>that</em> one are definitely distinct. Yet as you get close, you find that a cloud has no boundary at all. And, there are no connections holding it together.</p>
<p>So, what is going on here? The world is not <dfn>objectively</dfn> divisible into separate objects. Boundaries are, roughly, perceptual illusions, created by our brains. Moreover, which boundaries we see depends on what we are doing—on our purposes.</p>
<p>However, boundaries are not just arbitrary human creations. The world is immensely diverse. Some bits of it stick together much more than other bits. Some bits connect with each other in many ways besides just stickiness. The world is, in other words, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss3')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterned</a> as well as nebulous.</p>
<p>Therefore, objects, boundaries, and connections are <dfn>co-created</dfn> by ourselves and the world in dynamic interaction.</p>
<p><dfn>Monism</dfn>—“All is One”—is the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denial', 'gloss4')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.

It recognizes, accurately, that there are no <em>objective</em> boundaries, but then insists that this means there are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss5')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.

When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> no boundaries at all. (Or, that boundaries are merely subjective, purely creations of the mind, which is almost as wrong.)</p>
<p>In the same way, monism tends to over-emphasize connections. “Everything is totally connected” is a typical false monist claim. Everything <em>is</em> connected—by gravity—but most things are not connected in any meaningful way. Monism sees connections that don’t exist, producing a magical world view. (Misunderstood “quantum physics” is a common justification.)</p>
<p><dfn>Dualism</dfn> is the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixation', 'gloss6')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixation</a> of boundaries. It insists they are perfectly well-defined and objective. It also tends to deny connections that actually do operate.</p>
<p>The next several sections of the book explain how boundaries, objects, and connections work in detail. Along the way, I’ll have more to say about <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

<p>If what I said on this page was convincing, you could skip ahead, to the detailed discussions of monism, dualism, and participation.</p>
<p>However, the idea that the world is <em>not</em> made up of clearly separable objects, but is also not just one big blur, may be unfamiliar. Some readers may resist these claims; so I will explain in depth.</p>

<p>The question of existence and non-existence is a <dfn>colossal red herring</dfn>.</p>
<p>Many metaphysicists, both in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition and in the recent analytic tradition, have used sorites arguments to convince themselves that ordinary objects, such as pots and people, do not exist. This is a dire confusion.</p>
<p>Framing the problem as “whether and how objects exist” leaves the objects unchallenged and problematizes a property they may possess (viz. existence).  But it is objectness that is problematic, not existence!</p>
<p>This page will review the history of the confusion. I'll cover particularly the Madhyamaka arguments of Nagarjuna, which were actually the starting point for <cite>Meaningness</cite>; and the analytic mereological tradition that begins with Peter Unger, who wrote a paper titled “I do not exist.”</p>
<p>Part of the problem is a common pattern in metaphysics, of mistaking physical intuitions as metaphysical intuitions. Another problem is a consistent failure to ask what “exists” even means—if anything. I will give a sketch of an answer to that.</p>
<p>Then I'll explain that the sorites arguments have nothing to do with existence; correctly understood, they problematize boundaries, and therefore the concept “object” instead.</p>

<p>Monism holds that all religions and philosophies are essentially the same, and that they point at the same ultimate truth.  Namely, the truth of monism!

These <a href="#chap21">can combine</a>, producing for example monist eternalism or dualist nihilism.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dualist eternalism regarding the self/other boundary insists that you do have a self that is durable, separate, continuous, well-defined. Different versions assert conflicting claims about “what the self <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss8')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> is.” Or, they say, you <em>should</em> have a particular kind of self, so if you don’t, you need to fix that.</li>
<li>Monist eternalism says that <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss8')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.

<li>Nihilism says there is no self at all; the concept is meaningless, so if you think you have a self, you need to fix that.</li>
</ul>
<p>These combine in extra-confused ways. Some people claim that your self really doesn’t exist, <em>and</em> it is bad, so you need to get rid of it. Some claim that you have a hidden True Self, <em>and</em> it is the same thing as having no self. Some claim this True Self is The Entire Universe.</p>
<p>All such confusions come from the assumption that “the self” must live in something like a house, with solid walls that stay put and keep hailstorms outside and your pet aardvarks inside. Crazy ideologies begin when insightful people notice the self/other relationship not working like that, but lack a framework for understanding nebulous boundaries.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_nebulous">Nebulous selfness</h2>
<p>Recognizing that the “boundary” between self and other is both <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterned', 'gloss10')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form.

It is sometimes useful to say “selfness” or “selfing” to underline the non-object-ness.</p>
<p>Having abandoned the confused stances, there’s much to say about selfness in the complete stance. And this is all fascinating and often useful. But it’s important not to overvalue the details (so I will reluctantly limit my discussion). There’s more value simply in dissolving self <em>as a problem</em>. Once you firmly set aside the confusions, what remains doesn’t require a lot of fussing over.</p>
<p>For the complete stance, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss13')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a> lies in <dfn>dynamics</dfn>: patterns of interaction. To understand any particular dynamic, you have to look at aspects of both “self” and “other,” and also the “boundary” between them. (I’ve put scare quotes around all these to underline their nebulosity and non-object-ness.) Typically, most of “the self” and “the world” are irrelevant to a dynamic, so they are the wrong conceptual categories.</p>

<p>Let me make a ridiculous analogy. You notice that your house is increasingly inhabited by tarantulas, which you fail to fully appreciate due to arachnophobia. You could declare them illusions and ignore them (<i>no-self nihilism</i>); that would work until you wake up with a pair <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula#Reproduction">engaged in amorous activities↗︎︎</a> on your face. You could tear down all the walls (<i>monism</i>) because you and tarantulas and aardvarks are All One. However, you’d still have tarantulas, <em>plus</em> hailstorms, and the aardvarks might bolt. You could caulk all the tiny holes around the windows to keep tarantulas out (<i>dualism</i>)—but we’ll see that won’t help unless you nail the front door shut too. (Then you’d starve.) You might decide that your house is the wrong kind (the kind that tarantulas infest) and move into a different one—but it turns out that won’t work either. There’s nothing wrong with your house (<i>self</i>).</p>
<p>On investigation, you discover that your daughter has been bringing home a tarantula every day to feed to the aardvarks; but they don’t like tarantulas, and ignore them, so the would-be meals wander off to inhabit your dress shoes and silverware drawer.</p>
<p>The problem is not with the house, nor with the world outside the house. The problem is an activity that actively transports creatures across the boundary. Discussion with your daughter reveals that her biology teacher has told her that aardvarks eat bugs, and the biggest bugs she could find were tarantulas, so she thought your pets would especially enjoy them. A misconception easily corrected; problem solved.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_rdscysr" id="extra29_footnoteref1_rdscysr" title="Did you know that the only thing aardvarks eat besides ants and termites are aardvark cucumbers, which fruit underground? For desert-living aardvarks, these cucumbers are a vital water source. Conversely, aardvark cucumbers are entirely dependent on aardvarks for reproduction. Nothing else eats them to disperse the seeds.">1</a></p>
<p>Meaningness is like this, I will suggest. It is <a href="#chap110">neither objective nor subjective</a>: neither outside the self, nor inside. Rather, meanings are patterns of activity that cross the nebulous self/other boundary.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_control">Nebulosity of self makes complete control impossible</h2>
<p>“Intermittently continuing” is unsettling because it undercuts <a href="#chap34">fantasies of control</a>. It contradicts the ideal of a unitary subject with free will, because activity is always a dynamic, improvised collaboration with nebulous-but-patterned otherness.</p>
<p>(What I say here about control is condensed and may not make sense yet. I’ll explain more later in this chapter; the upcoming chapters on <a href="#chap122">capability</a> and <a href="#chap142">contingency</a> discuss nebulosity of control in depth.)</p>
<p>Any causal analysis of activity has to trace high-frequency loops of mutual influence that cross the self/other boundary. We cannot make independent choices because the permeability of that boundary—via perception and action—means we are never independent. It is futile to try to force interactions to conform to a preconceived idea of how they should go.</p>
<p>We cannot even control ourselves, because phenomena switch frequently from “self” to “other” and back; because “parts of self” have nebulous boundaries themselves; and because they are often more closely coupled to “other” than to other parts of self. As a dramatic example, when two people fall in love against their better judgement, each person’s emotions communicate more with the other’s than with their own more dispassionate thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_relationship">Allowing nebulosity of selfness enables accurate relationships</h2>
<p>Intermittently continuing means learning to be comfortable with the ambiguity and unpredictable changeability of selfness. That requires attention, courage, hard work, and good humor. However, it frees you from neurotic self-obsession, and increases the effectiveness and enjoyability of your relationships.</p>
<p>Supple, skillful selfing makes for satisfying, successful interactions. Firm and fluid othering enables us to <em>play with</em> the self/other boundary—whose interpenetrating nebulosity and pattern become a source of amusement. We can co-construct our lives as art projects in the shared space of meaningness, not inside or outside, but between and surrounding and pervading us.</p>

Or, the text below (if any) may be a summary, or a discussion of what the page will say, or a partial or rough draft.</p></div>
<p>This page will discuss the <dfn><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/">representational theory of mind↗︎︎</a></dfn>. This disastrously mistaken theory is accepted by most cognitive scientists. Consequently, it has become highly influential in general Western culture, and is taken for granted by most educated Westerners. It has significantly distorted our understanding of our selves, and so of how to live.</p>
<p>The theory originates in the analytic philosophy of of mind. (“Originates” both historically and logically.) Post–1950 philosophy of mind has two aims:</p>
<ol>
<li>To develop a convincing argument for <dfn>physicalism</dfn>—the doctrine that mental things are actually physical things, or are “reducible” to physical things.</li>
<li>To acknowledge and include <dfn>cognitivism</dfn>—the doctrine that people have beliefs, desires, and intentions (not merely dispositions and behaviors).</li>
</ol>
<p>Physicalism is opposed mainly to mind-body dualism: belief in a non-physical soul. The natural human view (of pre-modern people) is that the mind is not a physical thing. It is the “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_machine">ghost in the machine↗︎︎</a>”: a “spook.” The dualist view is that spooks are the sort of thing that can think; can have beliefs, desires, and intentions. A person is a spook plus a meat robot. Meat can’t think.</p>
<p>So the “cognitive project” has been to explain how meat <em>can</em> think. That requires exorcising the spook—the ghost in the machine. The representational theory of mind is the dominant approach.</p>
<p>Simplifying somewhat, it says that beliefs, desires, and intentions are “represented” as sentences in a special language (“mentalese”). Mentalese, in turn, is “implemented” as physical things (structures, states, or processes) in the brain.</p>
<p>Beliefs, desires, and intentions are <em>about</em> things outside the brain. For example, the belief that “snow is white” is about snow.</p>
<p>The question is: what does “about” mean? And how can things in the brain be about things outside the brain? What sort of relationship is this “aboutness”?</p>
<p>No good answers to these questions have been found. Worse, there are good in-principle reasons to think that no answers <em>can</em> be found:</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em"><em>If</em> beliefs, desires, and intentions were mental representations, <em>then</em> they would have to be non-physical. That is: spooky.</p>
<p>These are the “billion tiny spooks” of my title. The representational theory of mind beheads one big spook (the soul); but—like the Hydra—it simply returns as innumerable smaller ones.</p>
<p>(Bizarrely, mentalist philosophers often slip, and admit this in passing, describing representations as “non-physical”—despite their stated commitment to physicalism.)</p>
<p>The upshot is that either physicalism is wrong, or else the representational theory is wrong. Or both! I don’t have a strong opinion about physicalism; <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/metablog/philosophical-zombie">my guess↗︎︎</a> is that something <em>like</em> it is probably right, although it seems wrong as stated. Anyway, mind-body dualism is almost certainly wrong, so a non-spooky understanding of what it is to be human should be helpful.</p>
<p>The representational theory is also clearly wrong, for several reasons in addition to its logical contradictions. Overall, the problem is not that meat is the wrong thing to make beliefs, desires, and intentions from. It is that things inside the head cannot magically connect to things outside the head to be about them. (<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/#Internalism">This discussion↗︎︎</a> in the <cite>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</cite> is relevant, but may be opaque if you’re not familiar with the literature.)</p>
<p>The representational theory is not only <em>wrong</em>; it is also <em>harmful</em> for ordinary people’s understanding of what we are and how to live. I’ll also explain these malign consequences.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are alternative approaches to understanding what sort of things people are, which are more consistent with facts, and which lead to better ways to live. These approaches do not take the skull as a fixed boundary; their understandings span “inside” and “outside.” Their explanations involve <dfn>interactional dynamics</dfn> of physical causality that—through perception and action—constantly cross between “self” and “other.”</p>

<p class="intro_para">How can <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a> be neither objective nor subjective?  Doesn’t everything have to be one or the other? Either meanings are out there in the world, and properly objective, or inside you, and merely subjective or mental. Right?</p>
<p>As we've seen earlier in <a href="#chap92">this chapter</a>, the inside/outside, <a href="#chap95">self/other distinction</a> is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>, and often irrelevant, because meaning keeps crossing it. Meaningness <em>couldn't</em> be either subjective or objective, because it extends freely between, across, and around self and other.</p>
<h2>Not objective</h2>
<p>It's been obvious for more than a century that the universe is not inherently meaningful (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>). However, it's also not inherently meaningless (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>). It's neither inherently meaningful nor inherently meaningless because meaning is <em>not the sort of thing that can be inherent</em>.</p>
<p>Meaningness is an interactional dynamic that arises between oneself and one's situation. The problem comes when we deny our part in that, and try to put all the responsibility for meaningfulness out in the situation.  We want to do that because we don't trust ourselves.  We don't think the meanings we co-create will be good enough.  We want a solid, definite, separate, permanent, inherently existing meaning to be made available.  (This is what people invent God for—to feed us that kind of meaning.)  That kind of meaning would be reassuring and dependable.</p>
<p>However, there isn't any meaning like that.  The only kind that exists is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>: ambiguous, fluctuating, uncertain; like a dance, not like a statue.  That might seem unsatisfactory at first.  However, once you accept that meaning is like that, you can see that it's actually much better than the hypothetical solid kind of meaning. It provides freedom and creativity and exploration and lightness, where the given-by-God kind of meaning would be restrictive, dull, heavy, boring, and inescapable.  If the universe had inherent meaning we would all be living in a totalitarian prison.</p>
<h2>Not subjective</h2>
<p>If meaningness were merely subjective, or if it were a matter of individual or social choice, it would not be possible to be mistaken about it.  Yet we make mistakes about meaningness all the time.</p>
<p>This was the point of <a href="#chap30">my casino story</a>. I was mistaken not about what happened, factually, but about what it <em>meant</em>. You can't say that “the universe loves me" was "true for me". It was just plain false.</p>
<h2>Meaningness in the complete stance</h2>
<p>Meaning is a <dfn>collaborative, improvised accomplishment</dfn>. We re-make meaning in every moment, through concrete, situated <dfn>meaning-making work</dfn>.</p>
<p>Even the most simple, mundane meanings (like the meaning of breakfast) are interactional—they involve you, your yogurt and jam, the spoon and table, the people you are eating breakfast with, and (to decreasing extents) everyone involved in creating that situation, and all the non-human actors who were also involved. The more of that stuff you remove, the less meaning is there.</p>

<p>This chapter discusses <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stances', 'gloss0')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stances</a> toward purpose.</p>
<p>For an introduction to this topic, see "<a href="#chap2">An appetizer: purpose</a>."</p>
<p>The question of purpose is easy for both <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss1')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss2')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.  For a committed eternalist, your purpose is whatever the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss3')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a> says it is; no problem.  For a committed nihilist, there can be no purpose; no problem.  Both stances are difficult to live up to.  In practice, we usually fall into two other, confused stances: mission and materialism.</p>
<p>These <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss4')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stances</a> share an underlying mistaken metaphysical assumption: that purposes can be classified as "mundane" or "eternal," and only one sort is valuable. Mundane purposes are those we share with other monkeys: food, security, reproduction, and position in social dominance hierarchies.  Eternal purposes are those that transcend animal existence, such as creative production, disinterested altruism, and religious salvation. These also get called "higher" or "transcendent."</p>
<p><dfn><a href="#chap97">Materialism</a></dfn> is the stance that only mundane purposes count; it <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixates', 'gloss5')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense.

It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense. [Click for details.]">denies</a> eternal purposes. <dfn><a href="#chap113">Mission</a></dfn> is its <a href="#chap12">mirror image</a>: it fixates eternal purposes and denies mundane ones.</p>
<p>So, mission is the stance of “the transcendently valuable role given to me by God,” and materialism is the stance of “getting as much for myself as I can.”</p>
<p>Mission often additionally claims that each person has a <em>unique</em> eternal purpose; so it is mutually supportive with the stance of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'specialness', 'gloss7')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.  This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">specialness</a>. Materialism is concerned with purposes everyone shares; so it mutually supportive with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ordinariness', 'gloss8')" title="Ordinariness is the  confused stance that no one is better than anyone else, and that one’s value derives from herd membership. [Click for details.]">ordinariness</a>.</p>
<p>Both mission and materialism can be seen as <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'muddled middles', 'gloss9')" title="Confused stances come in mirror image pairs: extreme views on meaningness. Each pair shares an underlying mistaken metaphysical assumption about the nature of meaning. A muddled middle is an attempt to compromise between the extremes, to find a correct middle way. These fail because they do not correct the metaphysical error. The stance that corrects the error is complete, meaning that it neither fixates nor denies any aspect of meaningness. [Click for details.]">muddled middles</a> that try, and fail, to reconcile eternalism and nihilism. Additionally, there is a muddled middle that, recognizing the failures of both mission and materialism, tries to find a further halfway point between them. It <dfn><a href="#chap115">mingles materialism with mission</a></dfn>, attempting to satisfy the demands of both in a single course of action.  You might, for instance, pursue fame and glory leading a celebrity media campaign to save starving Africans from poverty.  Motivations are usually mixed.  When pursuing eternal purposes, one almost always also hopes for some mundane reward.</p>
<p>The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss10')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a> for purpose, <dfn><a href="#chap116">enjoyable usefulness</a></dfn>, rejects the mundane/eternal dichotomy.

<p>In this mingling, you try to satisfy the demands of both in a single course of action.

When pursuing eternal purposes, we almost always hope for some mundane reward.</p>
<p>This confused stance preserves the self-indulgent, self-protective grasping of materialism, <em>and</em> the self-righteous justification of mission. There is a cost to this. The mingled stance tends to lose the uncomplicated enjoyment-value of animal satisfaction (because we pretend that is not what we seek), and also the selfless compassionate joy of accomplishing eternal purposes (because we have subordinated those to a materialist agenda).</p>

<p><dfn>Victim-think</dfn> is a strategy for denying all responsibility. “Since I have no power, it’s not my fault, and you can’t expect me to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Victim-think is versatile; you can deploy it in many ways, varying across several axes. It applies to individuals and to social groups. It can be <em>first person</em> (I or we are victims), or <em>third person</em> (he/she/they are victims). You can use it as an excuse for bad behavior, or as a plea for aid. Those can be directed at powerful people or institutions, or at God or some other <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss0')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.

<p>Some common patterns of use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe I did steal that, but I am having a hard time. It’s society’s fault.</li>
<li>My social group is victimized, so we are justified in attacking members of another one.</li>
<li>I know this relationship is bad for both of us, but I’m too weak to end it.</li>
<li>That social group is oppressed, so the authorities should give them special privileges.</li>
<li>That guy is a member of an oppressed group, so you can’t hold him responsible for his criminal act.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these may be accurate in rare cases. More often, they are harmful distortions, and covert power-plays.</p>

They ignore nearly all the ethical questions people actually have. Academic and theological answers are useless, not because they are wrong, but because they address questions no one cares about.</p>
<p>Our most pressing ethical questions—such as “how ethical should I be?”—cannot even be <em>asked</em> within existing systems, much less answered correctly. And so, in practice, everyone has abandoned the systems.</p>

<p>The structure of this chapter should be familiar by now: it looks at an <a href="#chap12">opposing pair</a> of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss2')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness.

[Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of the topic (ethics); and develops the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss0')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a> that recognizes the inseparability of the nebulosity and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss5')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> of the topic.</p>
<p>The underlying mistaken metaphysical assumption is that, to be meaningful, ethics must have a definite, objective foundation.</p>
<p><dfn>Ethical eternalism</dfn> assumes there must be a correct ethical system that accurately reflects the objective reality. (This is a classic example of <a href="#chap51">wistful certainty</a>: there <em>must</em> be one, otherwise the universe would be <em>bad and wrong</em>, and that’s unthinkable.)</p>
<p>One main reason for clinging to eternalism <em>in general</em> is the fear that without an <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss6')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>, ethics is impossible. It is thought that ethics must be based in a transcendent source such as God or Rationality or Progress. Fortunately, that is not the case. Ethics arises, reliably, from the patterned interaction of innumerable factors. It does not require a definite foundation.</p>
<p>All existing eternalistic ethical theories are not merely <em>wrong</em>, they’re entirely irrelevant to the issues we actually care about. The ones they obsess over (deontology vs. consequentialism, trolley problems, what Jesus would have said) no one cares about. Those are quite unlike the ethical questions we typically encounter.</p>
<p><dfn>Ethical nihilism</dfn> recognizes (accurately) that ethics has no ultimate foundation, but then concludes that ethics is merely subjective and/or meaningless. This is wrong; it seems plausible only if one fails to challenge the underlying metaphysical assumption about the nature of ethics.</p>
<p><dfn>Ethical responsiveness</dfn> rejects the assumption and so can develop an accurate ethical practice.</p>
<p>Since <a href="#chap14">this three-fold pattern of analysis</a> is now familiar, I can dispose of ethical eternalism and ethical nihilism reasonably quickly.</p>
<p>Most of the chapter is devoted to an exploration of <dfn>everyday ethical practice</dfn>. Ethics is not a system of reasons (as in consequentialism and deontology), nor of personal traits (as in virtue ethics). It is patterns of <dfn>situated social practice</dfn>. “Situated” means that it is unboundedly dependent on context. “Social practice” means that it is inherently <dfn>collaborative</dfn>, <dfn>improvisational</dfn>, and <dfn>interpretive</dfn>.</p>
<p>I discuss numerous ethical phenomena that everyone encounters regularly, that we actually care about, and that are mostly or entirely ignored by existing ethical theories. I’ll address these both from an informal, participant-observer point of view, and based on recent research in evolutionary psychology and sociology. Along the way, I gradually introduce my normative judgements, pointing toward “responsiveness.”</p>

<p>This question comes up several times a day for most people, I believe. There is no existing ethical framework in which it can even be <em>asked</em>, much less answered. I think that’s a serious problem. People are disappointed by ethics and religion because they don’t get an answer, and that has negative consequences.</p>
<p>I use the question to introduce the <em>flavor</em> of my approach. It’s also a “forcing question”: trying to answer it uncovers a series of related issues in everyday ethical practice, which might otherwise be overlooked. </p>
<p>My first answer is that we should all be <em>much less ethical</em>. This answer is somewhat flip, and I’ll take it through a series of qualifications, modifications, and reverses. However, it’s also quite serious. The absence of a workable ethical framework leads us to devote great effort to applying ethics in domains where it’s the wrong tool. We should all stop doing that.</p>
<h2>Ethical nebulosity, ethical anxiety, and ethical ease</h2>
<p>[We cannot be certain about ethics because the topic is inherently nebulous. This leads to ethical anxiety. Ethical anxiety motivates much dysfunction, at both personal and whole-society levels. It is mainly unnecessary, however. Accepting the interplay of nebulosity and pattern dissolves most of it.]</p>
<h2>Ethical value and ethical metastasis</h2>
<p>[There are many forms of value: pragmatic value, aesthetic value, religious value, and ethical value among them. Over the past century, pluralism and relativism have eroded all types of value other than pragmatic and ethical. This leads to mis-using ethics as a stand-in for other non-pragmatic forms of value, notably sacredness. This <dfn>ethical metastasis</dfn> is hugely harmful. (I will analyze many specific cases.) I advocate de-ethicizing various domains and restoring them to their proper value-types.]</p>
<h2>Ethical display, ethical fungibility, and values marketing</h2>
<p>[<dfn>Ethical display</dfn> is communicating your ethical position. I'm using the word "display" in the ethnomethodological sense; it's closely related to "signaling" in evolutionary psychology and economics. (I've written at length about <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/">ethical signaling elsewhere↗︎︎</a>.)]</p>
<p>[<dfn>Ethical fungibility</dfn> is the idea that you can be less ethical in one situation if you've been more ethical than required in another. (Or, if you want to be less ethical now, you can promise to yourself that you'll make it up later.) There's an implicit sense of "karmic bank account" involved. We all do this, although it leads us to do wrong things. It makes intuitive sense due to the absence of a coherent approach to the question "how ethical should I be?".]</p>
<p>[<dfn>Values marketing</dfn> exploits ethical fungibility by adding small amounts of "ethics" to products in order to justify a much higher price tag. "Fair trade" coffee is the canonical example. People buy it to alleviate ethical anxiety and to build up their ethical bank balance. Starbucks is in the business of selling indulgences, in the Pre-Reformation sense!]</p>
<h2>Ethical agreement</h2>
<p>[Most supposed ethical disagreements are not genuinely about ethics, but about other value-types, or are display strategies. In fact, nearly everyone in modern societies agrees about nearly everything. Recognizing this alleviates ethical anxiety and promotes ethical freedom.]</p>
<h2>Ethical freedom</h2>
<p>[Here I discuss freedom <em>from</em> ethics. Often choice of action is <em>not</em> an ethical issue: you can do what you want. Ethical considerations are often not overriding (even where they apply at all). This is tremendously important, because creativity and enjoyment live in the zone between "must" and "must not."]</p>
<h2>Ethical responsiveness: the complete stance</h2>
<p>[Treating ethics as a situated social practice, we can ask: what tools and skills are available? How can we do this better?]</p>

<p class="meta_para">I have a fair amount of text completed, but not a clean version yet. The following is from the 2007 draft of <cite>Meaningness</cite>. It draws heavily on Camus’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0092EE9TI/?tag=meaningness-20">The Rebel↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Romantic rebellion starts from denying the “omnibenevolent” clause in Problem of Evil. Since there is undeserved suffering, the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss0')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a> is not good after all. Therefore the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss1')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a> must be defied. (This can apply to any source of order seen as corrupt, including God, Fate, The Establishment, “the artistic mainstream,” “oppressors,” or whatever.)</p>
<p>The first problem with romantic rebellion is that it is necessarily doomed, because it doesn’t actually deny the eternal principle, it merely defies it. The Authority remains omnipotent, or at any rate vastly more powerful than the rebel. So the enterprise is obviously hopeless from the start. </p>
<p>As a result, there is a certain lack of seriousness about the whole business. The rebel wants to convince himself that he’s <em>extremely committed</em> and that defying God is <em>massively courageous</em>, but it’s all quite silly. “Dream the impossible dream” &amp; tilt after windmills. It’s about glory, not practical consequences. Romantic rebellion is romantic because it is based in passion, not reason.</p>
<p>Recognizing this impracticality, the rebel must denigrate the possibility that things can actually be changed for the better. The rebel sees ordinary, pragmatic benevolence or reform as the enemy, because it draws attention away from the necessity of rejecting the existing order <i>in toto</i>. The rebel “can only exist by defiance”.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_778o5sf" id="extra29_footnoteref1_778o5sf" title="Camus, p. 47.">1</a> Any sort of moderation is also the enemy, because again it implies a degree of acceptance of what is. Total destruction is (in theory) the aim. Typically, the logic of romantic rebellion makes any actual destruction unnecessary, but there is always a danger that moral confusion plus romantic logic will lead to acts of terrorism. Mass murder on the scale of saturation bombing and concentration camps is not romantic, but suicide bombing—and destroying people’s careers using social media—can be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, actual retaliation from The Authority seems unlikely. (If genuine defense against The Authority becomes necessary, rebellion ceases to be romantic and becomes unpleasantly practical.)</p>
<p>The second problem is that romantic rebellion does not identify an alternative coherent source of value. (If you set up such a source, you’d have a new, different <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>; a different move.) Lacking such a source, romantic rebellion somewhat arbitrarily extols some of what was previously seen as good as evil, and vice versa. The two are blended. Extolling “the outlaw, the criminal with a heart of gold, and the kind brigand.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_ak2ea07" id="extra29_footnoteref2_ak2ea07" title="Camus, p. 46.">2</a> “The romantic hero, therefore, considers himself compelled to do evil by his nostalgia for an impracticable good.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_2okzf07" id="extra29_footnoteref3_2okzf07" title="Camus, p. 44.">3</a></p>
<p>In the Rudra move, one takes oneself to be the source of value. But the romantic rebel does not have the guts to do that, or has enough sense not to.</p>
<p>The romantic rebel actually recognizes his or her own confusion about values, and this is a source of suffering. This is a specifically <em>romantic</em> suffering that the rebel celebrates. It is a badge of honor.</p>
<p>Since there is no realistic hope or method for overthrowing The Authority, there is nothing practical for the rebel to do. What is left is to <em>maintain an attitude of opposition</em>. Quietly maintaining an attitude by oneself is not very exciting, however; and romantic rebellion is all about faux heroism. </p>
<p>Romantic rebellion is, therefore, necessarily a social activity. What is important is not simply to maintain an attitude, but to <em>strike an attractive pose</em>. One must be <em>seen</em> to be maintaining an attitude. </p>
<p>To be seen as a rebel, one must join in a <em>Movement</em> that forms the audience for one’s heroic pose. Further, one looks to The Movement for confirmation of one’s uncertain value judgements.</p>
<p>Within The Movement, the important thing is looking cool—since actually warring against God is hopeless, and actually doing anything useful undercuts the total rejection of the existing state of affairs. The actual source of value is personal glory. This entails playing to an audience; “always compelled to astonish”.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_yfcrf2t" id="extra29_footnoteref4_yfcrf2t" title="Camus, p. 48.">4</a></p>
<p>Romantic rebellion doesn’t work as theology (though people have tried; Satanism, for instance). </p>
<p>Romantic rebellion also makes for lousy politics. Striking defiant poses is not a workable basis for government—although it is the main activity of most contemporary politicians. Not to mention Islamist terrorists.</p>
<p>Romantic rebellion is a lot of fun, though, and can have terrific aesthetic value throughout the arts. E.g., rock’n’roll is all about romantic rebellion.</p>

We also sense new opportunities, and have new resources.</p>
<p>To relate better with meaningness in the future, it helps to understand how meaningness works now. To understand that, it helps to understand how it worked differently in the past.</p>
<p>So, <cite>Meaningness and Time</cite> begins with a history. It describes a chronological series of <dfn>modes of relating with meaningness</dfn>. I concentrate on the history of the past few decades—the period that some theorists call “postmodern.”</p>
<p>Modernity can be seen as a few centuries of trying to make <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss1')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalism</a> into a <a href="#chap151">systematic organizing principle</a> for culture, society, and self. This began to seem dubious a century ago, and the twentieth century was haunted by the specter of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss2')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>. That was the great twentieth century problem of meaningness. </p>
<p>Late in the century, many people concluded that systematic eternalism had <a href="#chap153">finally collapsed</a>. Yet the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilist apocalypse', 'gloss3')" title="The nihilist apocalpyse is the catastrophic social breakdown that eternalism fears would occur if people lost faith in eternalism.

In fact, there are other alternatives, so a nihilist apocalypse seems unlikely. However, nihilism actually can lead to unethical action, so one should not dismiss the possibility altogether. [Click for details.]">nihilist apocalypse</a> failed to arrive—at least not in the form feared. (<em>Too much</em> meaning is now a huge problem; absence of all meaning is not.) So then what, if neither eternalism nor nihilism?</p>
<p>The past half century has brought a succession of approaches to answering that, which I call the <dfn><a href="#chap155">countercultural</a></dfn>, <dfn><a href="#chap169">subcultural</a></dfn>, and <dfn><a href="#chap173">atomized</a></dfn> modes. Each has responded to a crisis of meaning created by the previous mode, and each has produced new serious problems.</p>
<p>That brings us to the present—the atomized mode of tiny jagged shards of meaning-stuff: globalized, commodified, decontextualized; a kaleidoscopic, hypnotizing, senseless spectacle. (<a href="https://twitter.com/meaningness">Twitter↗︎︎</a>, in other words.)</p>
<p>We cannot go back; each former mode was superseded because it did conclusively fail to provide what we needed from meaning. How can we go forward?</p>
<p>I sense, tentatively, a new mode emerging, which I’ll call <dfn><a href="#chap175">fluidity</a></dfn>. Perhaps, if I am right that there even is such a thing, it will manifest dire new problems of its own.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful, though, that it’s workable in ways that other recent modes were not.

I propose a series of <dfn>modes of relating to meaningness</dfn> that have developed over the past few decades. Each mode solves particular <dfn>problems of meaningness</dfn> caused by the previous mode; but introduces new problems of its own.</p>
<p>This page introduces the modes; chapters within this history explain the modes and their implications in detail.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_history">A very brief history of meaningness</h2>
<p>The <dfn><a href="#chap150">choiceless mode</a></dfn> is unaware that alternative meanings are possible. This is the mode of closed cultures; of societies isolated from other peoples. It has not existed in the West for several centuries, and is increasingly rare world-wide.</p>
<p><em>The problem</em>: When cultures come into contact, they experience conflicts over meanings. Other peoples do things differently; their beliefs seem obviously wrong to us. But they think our beliefs and practices are wrong. How do we know ours are right? </p>
<p><em>The solution</em>: The <dfn><a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a></dfn> tries to solve this problem by creating unarguable foundations, to restore <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>. This mode is closely allied with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss1')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>, although not all eternalism is systematic. The systematic mode is <dfn>universalist</dfn>; it says that meanings are the same for everyone, everywhere, eternally.</p>
<p><em>The new problem</em>: During the twentieth century, it became apparent that attempts to build unshakable foundations had failed, and suspicion grew that it was actually impossible. That raised the threat of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss2')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>: perhaps everything is actually meaningless?</p>
<p>By the 1960s, mainstream systematic society and culture had become <a href="#chap153">obviously dysfunctional</a>. They failed to provide adequate meaningfulness, and there was general revulsion at the mainstream’s nihilistic moral breakdown.</p>
<p><em>The new solution</em>: The <dfn><a href="#chap155">countercultural mode</a></dfn> developed in response. It came in two flavors, the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss3')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monist</a> counterculture (the hippie movement) and the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualist', 'gloss4')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a> counterculture (the Moral Majority). These movements proposed universalist systems of meaning that were alternatives to the mainstream. Although rhetorically opposed, the two countercultures were structurally similar, shared historical roots, and had more in common than is usually recognized.</p>
<p><em>The next problem</em>: The universalism of the countercultures was a fatal flaw. Their new visions were both unable to appeal to a majority. They were unable to encompass the diversity of views on meaningness now found within societies (and across the world). Because they were mass movements, they could not provide community.</p>
<p><em>The next solution</em>: The <dfn><a href="#chap169">subcultural mode</a></dfn> abandoned universalism, and with it the attempt to find <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss5')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimate</a> foundations for meaning. Instead, subcultures provided numerous “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotribalism">neotribal↗︎︎</a>” systems of meaning that were meant to appeal only to small communities of like-minded people. Some subcultures explicitly extolled nihilism.</p>
<p><em>The problem with that:</em> Subcultures proved unable to provide either the breadth or depth of meaning people need. Also, lacking strong organizing principles, they repeatedly fissioned in response to differences in view. This is most obvious in the case of subcultures centered on musical genres. The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_subgenres">heavy metal subgenres↗︎︎</a> is worth a look. Heavy metal is a subgenre of rock, the primary countercultural genre, and spawned a subculture. Death metal is a subsubgenre. Melodic death and technical death are subsubsubgenres.</p>
<p>Around the end of the millennium, subcultures reached the limit of fragmentation, and the mode became unworkable. You can try to live the melodic death lifestyle, but it’s not going to answer most of your questions about Life, The Universe, And Everything. The attempt to provide coherent meanings without foundations had failed. Meaning disintegrated altogether.</p>
<p id="extra29_atomized"><em>What came next</em>: The <dfn><a href="#chap173">atomized mode</a></dfn> takes incoherence for granted. It does not seem a problem, in this mode; we don’t need systems. Meanings do not hang together. They are delivered as bite-sized morsels in a jumbled stream, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. Or—to use the thing itself as a metaphor for itself—like <a href="https://twitter.com/meaningness">Twitter↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p><em>The problems we have now</em>: Throughout the twentieth century, from the beginning of the breakdown of the mainstream systems until the breakdown of subcultures, the underlying worry was “not enough meaning.” The atomized mode delivers, for the first time, way <em>too much</em> meaning. It is overwhelming, like trying to drink from a firehose.</p>
<p>Because the shards of meaning do not relate with each other, it’s impossible to compare them. There is no standard of value, so everything seems equally trivial. The collapse of subcultural community has atomized society, and we find it impossible to construct satisfactory selves from the jagged fragments of meaning we’re bombarded with.</p>
<p><em>Now what</em>: A new <dfn><a href="#chap175">fluid mode</a></dfn> may address our current problems of meaningness. My understanding of fluidity is tentative; it’s based partly on observation of current trends, and partly on the intrinsic logic of meaningness.</p>
<p>The fluid mode approximates the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss6')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a>, which incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism: recognizing that meaningness is always both <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterned', 'gloss7')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterned</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss8')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>. Likewise, the fluid mode acknowledges structures of meaning without attempting rigid foundations. Its values are collaboration, creativity, improvisation, intimacy, transience, aesthetics, and spiritual depth through community ritual.</p>
<p>The fluid mode goes meta to the process that generated the previous modes. It understands how each solved serious problems of meaningness. It’s therefore able to use each of those solutions when similar problems arise.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_periods">Periods, people, cultures, and categories</h2>
<p>The various modes appeared at different times; but none of them entirely displaced previous ones. Each arose among some leading-edge group, spread as its solutions became widely understood, and diminished gradually as its own problems became obvious and the next mode mostly replaced it.</p>
<p>Anyone living in the West now can relate to meaningness in any of the modes, and sometimes does. However, which mode seems most natural, and which mode one uses most often, varies from person to person.</p>
<p>It seems that the way one relates to meaningness is learned when one is roughly 15–25 years old; and for most people it is difficult to change after that. The mode that feels <dfn>native</dfn> is likely the one prevalent in your peer group at that age. Newer modes seem unattractive and unnatural. Their problems are more obvious than the opportunities they offer. For example, many in the Baby Boom generation remain loyal to their counterculture, even though they have participated in subcultures, and experience atomization when they use the internet.</p>
<p>People have different preferences in relating to change. Some would rather be at the hip leading edge, and are likely to adopt the modes typical of younger generations; some prefer the safety of the trailing edge.</p>
<p>Nations and cultures, too, vary in the speed at which they adopt new modes of meaningness. The Islamic world, for instance, has only partly transitioned from the choiceless to the systematic mode, and is mostly unable to cope yet with the following ones. Some poor countries are being forced by the internet from the choiceless world directly into the atomized one; that’s extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Since <em>none</em> of the modes is fully functional, none constitutes straightforward progress. I’m sympathetic to the conservative impulse to resist these changes and stick with a mode that seems to mostly work. Later in this section, I’ll write about the risks and costs of too-fast change. However, I believe the only way out is through. And, I hope that the fluid mode will be able to incorporate the valuable aspects of all the others.</p>
<p id="extra29_simplistic">You may be skeptical of my “modes” as categories; you may find them simplistic, and counterexamples may come to mind. If so, you are quite right. They are meant as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_type">ideal types↗︎︎</a>”: heuristic conceptual categories that illuminate some trends, while inevitably distorting others. They are not meant as ontological; they have no existence in the real world.</p>
<p>In fact, after finishing this history, I will demolish it. The whole thing is a lie. There are no modes; we are always “in the fluid mode” because meaningness has always been both <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterned', 'gloss7')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterned</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss8')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>. No culture or society was ever actually systematic, for the same reason no one can actually be an eternalist: nebulosity is always obvious. No culture or society can actually be atomized, for the same reason no one can actually be a nihilist: patterns are always obvious.</p>
<p>The analysis of modes is useful for the same reason as the analysis of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss11')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stances</a>. Though we are, in some sense, always in the complete stance, and always in the fluid mode, we try to imagine otherwise. That can have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_sources">Sources and similar analyses</h2>
<p>Most of this history may be familiar; I may have nothing original to say. I’ve drawn on at least five sources:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>The standard historical analysis of modernity, nihilism, and postmodernity</li>
<li>The sociology of American generational attitudes</li>
<li>My personal experience living through most of the modes</li>
<li>Adult developmental psychology</li>
<li>Vajrayana Buddhist theory</li>
</ul>
<p>My explanations of the choiceless (“traditional”) and systematic (“modern”) modes, the threat of nihilism, the rise of the monist counterculture, and the end of modernity are all standard intellectual history. “Postmodernity”—a historical concept that is now widely accepted—corresponds to the subcultural and atomized modes.</p>
<p>I began thinking about the history of meaningness when trying to understand why Buddhism appeals much more to Western Baby Boomers than to younger people. The answers I wrote <a href="https://approachingaro.org/is-buddhism-just-for-baby-boomers">in 2009↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/19/inclusion-exclusion-unity-and-diversity/">in 2011↗︎︎</a> were early versions of the history I’m presenting here.</p>
<p>I discovered that there is as much of a generation gap between Buddhists of Generation X and Generation Y as between the Boomers and Gen X. That lead me to read about generational differences, which helped me understand that “postmodernity” includes two quite different modes (subcultural and atomized), which are native for Generations X and Y respectively.</p>
<p>I seemed to have as much in common with Gen Y as with Gen X. (Probably that is because I am a perpetual adolescent and refuse to grow up. I’ve never owned a house, married, had children, or—arguably—ever had a “real” job.)</p>
<p>Affinity with Gen Y made me realize that I could understand cultural, social, and psychological change through my own experience and memories. I’ve lived through most of the history I describe. Each successive mode has radically changed the way I’ve lived, and the way I experience my self. I grew up in a museum of mainstream systematic culture; tried to be a hippie in my early twenties (though it was too late); enthusiastically participated in numerous subcultures through the ’80s and ’90s; experienced the dissolution of subculturalism, found myself atomized by the internet; and am now groping for fluidity.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the changes in my experience of meaningness led to the problem/solution framework I present here. Its details may be original. However, it’s structurally similar to theories of adult psychological development such as that of Robert Kegan, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003772KJC/?tag=meaningness-20">The Evolving Self↗︎︎</a>, which influenced me heavily in my twenties. <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">Kegan’s framework↗︎︎</a> concerns “meaning-making,” and suggests that each developmental stage solves problems created by the previous one. </p>
<p><a href="#extra5_spiral">Spiral Dynamics</a> extrapolates such theories from psychological to cultural development. Roughly, its beige, purple, and red memes correspond to the choiceless mode; blue and orange to the systematic mode; green to the monist counterculture; and yellow to the fluid mode. It doesn’t seem to include anything corresponding to the countercultural/subcultural/atomized distinctions (just as the theory of postmodernity does not).</p>
<p>In Kegan’s framework, and in Spiral Dynamics, each developmental stage goes meta to the last, so that whatever was previously experienced as “subject” becomes “object,” and a new subject, or self, emerges to reflect on it. Also, the stages alternate between excesses of individuation and social embeddedness. I love the elegance of this structure, but it mostly doesn’t fit the changes I’m writing about. Instead, I see each mode as containing the seeds of its own destruction, because its supposed solution becomes the next problem.</p>
<p>The final influence on my story is the Vajrayana Buddhist theory of form, emptiness, and non-duality; or eternalism, nihilism, and Dzogchen (the Tibetan word for “completion”). The Vajrayana understanding of “nihilism” is close to the Western one, and “eternalism” is analogous to Western understandings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalism">foundationalism↗︎︎</a>, which is the philosophical basis for the systematic mode. Vajrayana’s analysis of the failures of both nihilism and eternalism echoes that of current Western philosophy; but it claims also to provide a solution that avoids the problems of both by incorporating the insights of both. That was the starting point for <cite>Meaningness</cite>, this book. The central claim of the book is that complete stances can resolve the problems of the confused stances. Similarly, I hope that the fluid mode can resolve the problems of postmodernity.</p>
<p>Incorporating this Vajrayana view points toward a possible solution—fluidity—whose details might not be predictable in other frameworks.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The <dfn>choiceless mode</dfn> of relating to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a> has no “becauses.” In the <dfn><a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a></dfn>, when you ask “why,” a system answers “because…”. The “becauses” hang together in ways that make everything make sense. In the choiceless, or <dfn>pre-systematic</dfn> mode, that’s not necessary—or even conceivable.</p>
<p>In the choiceless mode, you know of only one way of understanding meaningness. You are unaware of any alternatives. In fact, you are also unaware of your own understanding; of the possibility of alternatives; and of your lack of awareness.</p>
<p>In a choiceless culture, no one asks “why?” about meanings, and so there is no “because” needed to answer. Asking doesn’t occur to you. Meaning is a given: inherent in people and things. Water rats are tasty; there’s no point asking why. You marry your mother’s brother’s daughter; to marry your father’s brother’s daughter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_and_cross_cousins">would be an abomination↗︎︎</a>; you do not think to ask why.</p>
<p>In a choiceless society, you are defined by your social position. You are the son of so-and-so, and belong to the eagle clan—as your father, the clan chief, did. When he died, your elder brother wore the eagle clan hat at the wake. If your brother dies before you, you will wear the clan hat. Like all eagles, you are an enemy of the horse clan and allied to the bear clan. You knew from the age of five that you would marry your mother’s brother’s daughter. This is your self; this is who you are.</p>
<p>In a choiceless culture, art follows forms handed down through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation">legitimate peripheral participation↗︎︎</a> plus some oral explanation. The forms are unquestioned; they are simply as they are. Making art (in the broad sense—music, stories, clothing) is a communal activity. There is no sense of authorship, or originality as a value.</p>
<p>All of this is just how it is; there is no “because” available.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Of course, pesky children and anthropologists do ask “why?”. If they are persistent, they’ll get some story that makes no sense. Answers in choiceless societies follow dream logic, not pragmatic logic. Typically they involve biologically-impossible sex acts, a flying buffalo-woman, or a talking snake in a magic fruit tree.</p>
<p>In choiceless cultures, meaningness is not a problem. <em>You</em> may have a problem, because you loathe the cousin you have to marry, but that’s just practical. It’s a fact you have to live with, like the permanent limp you got with an ankle broken when you were a kid. It does not occur to you to blame the system, because you have no concept of systems.</p>
<p>Meaning in choiceless societies seems timeless and changeless. Particular meanings can and do change, but within the culture this is noticed only as specific, local, contingent changes, rather than as a general dynamic. There is little sense of history; of change beyond that experienced during one’s life, and in one’s community.</p>
<p>Many social scientists use the word “traditional” to mean what I’m calling “choiceless.” However, “traditional” is also used to mean entirely other things,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_xhoy60d" id="extra29_footnoteref1_xhoy60d" title="In postmodernity, conservatives often use “traditional” to mean “modern,” i.e. the way things were until forty years ago. “Traditional” can also mean no more than “we did it that way last time.” As we’ll see, traditions are often back-dated by their inventors, to make them seem non-choices.">1</a> so I’ve invented the new term to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p>The choiceless mode is the most natural one. Nearly all humans who have ever lived have only experienced meaning in the choiceless mode. Our brains co-evolved with choicelessness, and it <em>feels right</em>. All the other modes <em>feel wrong</em>. So <a href="#chap147"><cite>Meaningness and Time</cite></a> is about why the other modes—despite all their genuine benefits—make us unhappy, and what to do about that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the choiceless mode depends on ignorance of alternatives. It’s usually impossible for nearly everyone in the developed world, and survives mostly only in remote areas in the most “backward” countries.</p>
<p>In 2003, I spent a month on pilgrimage in the Himalayan backcountry; one of the poorest and most remote places in the world. I went to practice my religion, <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/10/24/sutra-tantra-and-the-modern-worldview/">Tantric Buddhism↗︎︎</a>, with people for whom it is the normal way of life. In that, I was naive and mainly disappointed. As with notional Buddhists everywhere in Asia, few people were aware of even the most basic Buddhist doctrines or practices, and almost no one had Buddhist motivations.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_lww45br" id="extra29_footnoteref2_lww45br" title="Instead, they practiced “the worldly yana,” a religion of practical benefits.">2</a></p>
<p>Yet my month there was probably the happiest of my life. What I found instead was a sane, optimistic, decent society, that <em>felt right</em> to me, and I believe also to most people in it. Presumably part of that rightness was religious commonality. A Catholic might feel something similar on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago">pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela↗︎︎</a>. I don’t think that commonality was the main thing, though.</p>
<p>I would like to believe that Buddhism is a particularly good religion, and this was a good place with good people partly due to its Buddhist history—even if there is not much Buddhism now. At the time, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever their experience of religion, it seems to have a very salutary effect on their character. It has been remarked by visitors here for hundreds of years that they are exceptionally honest, hard-working, considerate, sensible, polite, reserved, hospitable and decent; it is hard to resist summing this up as “noble.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think, though, that the quasi-Buddhist content of the culture may have been less important than that it was a rare survival of the choiceless mode. The people had an intact social order, with ritual roles that everyone understood thoroughly and accepted without question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I took part in a procession (splendid costumes, trumpets and cymbals, deity and sword dance, fire offering) in which lots of old people were counting Guru Rinpoche mantra. So I pulled out my rosary and practiced mantra too. This got lots of amused looks (politely hidden, except in the case of small children). Norbu said today that he had overheard conversation and in fact everyone was excited and happy to see a white Buddhist; they had never seen one before. Maybe I should practice in public more often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My own experience was one of choicelessness, too, or as much as I’ve ever had. At a literal, practical level, there were almost no decisions I could make. I knew only a few dozen words of the language, so I was dependent on the translator and organizer of the pilgrimage. Experientially, I was wide-open due to the combination of culture shock and intensive meditation practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I find myself in an a situation that is clearly <em>not me</em>, with no explanation for how this could have happened, producing a sense of surreal dislocation. For example, a month ago I found myself working as an unpaid waiter in the restaurant attached to a Hindu temple in Malaysia, due presumably to <em>some</em> causal chain that I could not begin to reconstruct. My ability to laugh and ecstatically <em>go with</em> such situations (“I’ve no clue why how or why am I here, nor do I have the foggiest idea how to be a waiter in general, much less in a Malaysian Hindu temple restaurant, but I will do the absolute best job I can and enjoy it thoroughly, because why not”) seems to be the best measure of my health at the level of energy.</p>
<p>Here the most important religious practice in an individual’s life is the Annual Ritual. This is a house-and-family-blessing ritual. A crew of monks are hired to provide the requisite clangs, blaats, and hocus-pocus<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_ejh2k36" id="extra29_footnoteref3_ejh2k36" title="Clangs from cymbals, blaats from trumpets, and hocus pocus from religious texts read out loud.">3</a> in the house’s shrine room (every house has one). While they are in there performing the ritual, the head of household participates in a small way. Mostly, however, the Annual Ritual is an excuse to invite all your friends and extended family over for some serious drinking (in the rest of the house). Exactly how this can be the most important religious practice in an individual’s life, I don’t understand, since the practice seems to be done by the monks almost exclusively. This is part of the general paradox that everyday life here is thoroughly infused with religious practice, and yet in a sense they don’t seem to practice at all. (They pay monks to do it for them.)</p>
<p>Anyway, yesterday I found myself inexplicably in the shrine room of a house undergoing Annual Ritual, helping the monks. Mostly they knew the liturgy by heart, which I didn’t, and there was no spare copy of the text, and in any case I can’t read Tibetan fast enough to keep up. So my participation was mostly restricted to throwing rice at appropriate moments, and joining in on the very occasional bits of liturgy I recognized (such as Guru Rinpoche mantra).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the pilgrimage, I concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve gained significant new insight into what makes me happy and miserable; and, relatedly, into the nature of my energy problem. Briefly, in managing a business, I learned to divide my energy finely, and to send out the fragments of my being to animate all the minute details of a complex enterprise—leaving as little as I possibly could within my own body. Over the years this became a habit, and one that has been difficult to unlearn. Here, I have been entirely cut off from “the world” and its complexities, into which I would habitually discharge my energy. I have instead been surrounded by natural beauty and by the sacred. Practicing perception and nowness, together with some specific energy methods, has drawn my energy back into my body, coherent and undivided. The challenge now will be to make that habitual even when dancing in the <a href="https://vividness.live/2012/08/22/charnel-ground/">charnel ground↗︎︎</a> that is the Western world.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_because">The rise and fall of “because”</h2>
<p class="intro_para">Western culture, society, and selves all fell apart forty years ago. Or so say many theorists; and I agree. To understand how we relate to meaning now, and how we could better relate in the future, we need to understand that recent past.</p>
<p>A <dfn>systematic</dfn> culture answers “why” questions with “becauses.” The answers are reasonably consistent and coherent. A series of “why” questions eventually reaches an <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss0')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimate</a>, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss1')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal Truth</a>. This Truth is the foundation of the system, which supposedly answers all questions for everyone, everywhere, eternally. </p>
<p>Religious systems, government systems, economic systems, aesthetic systems, philosophical systems, scientific systems, family systems: until a few decades ago, these provided iron frameworks for meaning. Meanings were held safely in place, certified by reliable structures.</p>
<p>This was an extraordinary accomplishment. Systems are not normal or natural. Almost no one has had them in the hundreds of thousands of years humans have been around. Nearly everyone has had to make do without becauses. Human progress over the past few centuries can be attributed almost entirely to systems.</p>
<p>Then, “because” stopped working. We are back in a becauseless world—like and unlike that of our <a href="#chap150">pre-systematic</a> ancestors.</p>
<p>We have not yet figured out how to live well without becauses. Suggestions about how to do that are the goal of <a href="#chap147"><cite>Meaningness and Time</cite></a>. First, though, I will explain how “because” worked, how it stopped working, and where that leaves us.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
<ol>
<li>The history of the rise and fall of “because” is extremely interesting. However, it’s a standard academic topic that I have nothing new to say about. (My tale begins in the aftermath.) So this page presents just a brief summary, for readers who are unfamiliar with the backstory.</li>
<li>The question of how systems arose, and how (and whether) they failed, is one of the most important and most debated among historians. A careful account, with caveats and footnotes, would be much longer. My version may be a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story">Just So Story↗︎︎</a>,” or fanciful fable. I find it illuminates recent events, but you have every right to be skeptical.</li>
<li>Historians often use the word “modern” to mean what I’m calling “systematic.” The “modern era” covers roughly the late 1400s until the late 1900s. However, “modern” has other meanings.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_cy3c7cy" id="extra29_footnoteref1_cy3c7cy" title="For instance, in ordinary usage, “modern” often just means “current.” In art criticism, it covers the late 1800s to about 1980—only a small part of the period called “modern” by most historians. That narrower usage of “modern” corresponds to the period of “systems in crisis and breakdown” described next.">1</a> To avoid confusion, I’ve chosen a non-standard word.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="extra29_why">Why systematicity happens</h2>
<p>A society builds a systematic culture when it becomes aware of alternatives. When your tribe meets another that thinks it’s not OK to marry cousins, like you do, the natural thing to do is to kill and eat those barbarians. In rare cases, this is impractical, and you are stuck with talking to them. They criticize your marriage system, which you didn’t even know you had, and theirs is horrifying. (Or dangerously appealing, if you don’t like the cousin you have to marry.) So now you need to come up with a justification, and stories about talking snakes with magic apples no longer cut it.</p>
<p>The European Renaissance is a key example.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_z4zid6j" id="extra29_footnoteref2_z4zid6j" title="Systematicity is a matter of degree, not all-or-nothing. The earliest urban societies were already somewhat systematic five thousand years ago. Ancient India, China, Greece, and Rome were quite systematic at their peaks. Rome, especially, was astonishingly modern; it wasn’t until the 1600s, or perhaps even 1700s, that Europe caught up to where it had been a millennium and a half earlier. Rome’s modernity, and its success, was due to its cosmopolitanism: its willingness to adopt and adapt the life-ways of other cultures.">2</a> Global trade gradually made Western Europeans increasingly aware of alternative cultures: Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the Islamic world, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo">even China↗︎︎</a>. A major push came with a wave of refugees from the Fall of Constantinople (1453), who brought with them the texts of Ancient Greece and Rome (which had been lost in the West), plus the culture of the Byzantine Empire, plus Persian and Arabic scholarship.</p>

<p>Europeans gradually recognized many of these foreign ideas as serious challenges, or even as right. Meaningness became <em>a problem</em>. How to resolve conflicts between meanings?</p>
<p>The Renaissance got a head start by discovering that the Ancient Greek philosophers had asked the same question, and had found plausible answers. The rest is well-known: the Protestant Reformation (which ended choiceless Christianity), the European Enlightenment, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the rise of capitalism, democracy, individual rights, and the general triumphal march of modernity.</p>

<p>A systematic society has a multitude of social roles—unlike a <a href="#chap150">choiceless society</a>, which has only a few.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_9oi6hri" id="extra29_footnoteref3_9oi6hri" title="On the other hand, in a systematic society, each person has only a handful of roles; whereas in post-systematic societies, we all have so many we can’t keep track of them.">3</a> Each role is defined by a code of regulations, which are rationally derived from Ultimate Truth. Roles fit together into complex institutions—church, state, corporation, community—that accomplish society’s proper goals. Everything makes sense—everything has a “because”—so everyone knows what they are supposed to do. These systems together provide a stable, harmonious social order. Relationships among people, and between people and God, work as they should. (Or, at any rate, this is the theory.)</p>
<p>Systematicity makes possible the division of labor. This crucial social technology enabled the spectacular economic, artistic, technological, and intellectual advances of the systematic era. Despite all the attractions of the choiceless mode, no one actually wants to return to it if that means giving up the benefits of the systematic one.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_mcha9k9" id="extra29_footnoteref4_mcha9k9" title="When I travelled in Asia, everywhere I went, I asked people “would you rather live here or in Singapore?” Everyone said “I love it here—I would miss the food, my family, the pace of life—but yeah, I’d rather live in Singapore where I could own a big TV.”">4</a></p>

<p>Systematic culture provides the web of “becauses” that hold society and selves together. It explains why the way we do things is the <em>right</em> way.</p>
<p>Systematic culture is <dfn>rational</dfn>, in the original sense. “Ratio” is Latin for “reason,” both in the sense of “reasoning”—the thinking process—and “reasons”—meaning justifications. Systematic culture thinks out reasons for everything. Supposedly, these are based on unshakable foundations that can’t be argued against. The culture builds up, from there, a cathedral of consistent and coherent meanings and values, a vaulting architecture of columns and buttresses, beams and arches, principles and proofs; light and airy, yet firm enough to last till Judgement Day.</p>
<p>A systematic culture is reflective. It discusses itself, describes itself, judges itself, rationalizes itself. Systematic knowledge is abstract, explicit, codified, and universal. Whatever is good and true is good and true for all people everywhere, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternally</a>. Systematic culture is learned in schools and from books more than by apprenticeship.</p>
<p>At the height of systematic culture, in the mid–1800s, religion, philosophy, politics, science, and all the arts were in agreement. Philosophy was not separate from theology, and atheism disqualified you as a philosophy professor. Religion was considered rational; it gave justifications consistent with common sense. Political and economic theory mainly justified the existing social order, drawing reasons from both religion and science. Science discovered the Will of God, as manifest in His Creation. Great art was, by definition, morally improving. Art expressed the highest values of the culture; it was pure, inspiring, and uplifting.</p>
<p>Or so went the official story. With hindsight, this may all sound ridiculous, and even repellent. We know that it failed conclusively a hundred years later. And there were, of course, prescient dissenters. But the internal contradictions in the systematic worldview were mainly invisible at the time, and it did work astonishingly well for several centuries.</p>
<p id="extra29_palace">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Palace">Crystal Palace↗︎︎</a>, built in 1851, was a triumphant showcase of systematicity. An engineering and economic marvel, its elegant geometrical design also reflected the classical rationality of the time. At once it reflected the elegant symmetry and simplicity of Greek temples—great expressions of a previous systematic culture—and pointed to a glorious, literally En-lightened and up-lifted future.</p>
<p>The Palace was an enormous building with walls and roofs entirely of glass. Nothing like it had ever been seen. It was made possible by the invention of glass plate casting, just two years earlier, which was much cheaper and produced much higher-quality glass than earlier processes. The glass plates were assembled into modules, held in place with cast-iron beams. Standardization of the modules enabled mass production, a new systematic social technology. From design on paper to opening, it took only eight months to build the Palace, and its cost was a quarter that of a conventional building of the same size.</p>
<p>The Crystal Palace was built to hold <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Exhibition">The Great Exhibition↗︎︎</a>. That was first World’s Fair: shows of culture and industry, art and commerce, that were major events for the next century. The Great Exhibition included displays of fine art from around the world and through the centuries; a concert hall; exhibits of all manner of manufactured goods such as cameras, jewelry, locks, guns, and musical instruments; cutting-edge technologies like telegraphs and microscopes; and entire working factories, such as a cotton mill that went from the raw material to finished cloth. It was a huge success.</p>

<p class="ctrimgcaption">John Calvin: a main contributor to the development of the systematic self</p>
</figure>
<p>Living in a systematic society requires, and enables, a systematic self—quite different from a choiceless self.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_9lu0i90" id="extra29_footnoteref5_9lu0i90" title="My explanation here draws on Robert Kegan’s model of psychological development. My “choiceless self” corresponds to his “interpersonal self”, and my “systematic self” to his “institutional self”. These are stages 3 and 4 of his 5-stage schema. “Fluidity” is meant to correspond to his stage 5.">5</a></p>
<p>In the <a href="#chap150">choiceless mode</a>, you are defined by your relationships; mainly family ones. Being a daughter, mother, and cousin determines what you feel and do. The function of your self is balancing your personal impulses with the needs of others, according to those roles. Morality—being a good person—means maintaining harmony by conforming to collective clan decisions. The choiceless self <em>belongs</em>, and is embedded in a web of mutual caring.</p>
<p>This sort of self is incompatible with complex social institutions. Efficient, specialized work gives you obligations to strangers, on the basis of explicit rules, not felt needs. A self devoted to balancing needs based on relationships cannot make sense of systematic society. It can only experience impersonal obligations as unjust demands imposed by the powerful, for the gratification of their own desires, at the expense of everyone else. Such a self must violate these demands frequently, or (if subjugated) will feel constantly resentful.</p>
<p>To create a systematic self, you emerge from embeddedness, as an <dfn>individual</dfn>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_og7q7a8" id="extra29_footnoteref6_og7q7a8" title="According to Kegan, Americans in the 1970s typically created an “institutional self” when they left home for college, full-time work, or the military. Primary membership in an institution outside the family is a natural impetus. I’ve put “created” in the past tense, because—as I will explain in upcoming pages—I suspect it is no longer possible to create a systematic self in the way it was then.">6</a> An individual has relationships, where a choiceless self <em>is</em> relationships. For an individual, the obligations of a relationship are determined by impersonal, rational considerations, not by intensity of feelings.</p>
<p>Creating a systematic self involves hardening boundaries, so other people’s emotions don’t flood you and compel your actions. The subject/object boundary encloses a new inner world of private, reflective experience. Relationships themselves are brought inside, as objects you can consider rationally.</p>
<p>Where the choiceless self <em>is</em> a self, the systematic self <em>has</em> a self: it takes itself as an object in its inner world. The systematic self is able to reason about itself, in relation to others, according to roles, and can adjudicate their requirements dispassionately. For the systematic self, ethics—being a good person—means conforming to abstract systems of laws, rules, and institutions. It means conscientiousness: doing what you have explicitly agreed to do, regardless of how you and others feel about that. It means doing what is necessary to maintain the system and uphold its values.</p>
<p>At first this feels unnatural, but since you now <em>have</em> a self, you can act on your self. You become the administrator of your internal world. You can choose among competing desires systematically, instead of according to which yells louder. You can manipulate yourself into better behavior; into conformity with a systematic society. When successful, you reward yourself with self-esteem, which is abstract and purely internal, rather than with impulse-gratification.</p>
<p>All this is far more sophisticated than the choiceless self, whose inner world is just a chaos of emotions, which aren’t even particularly yours, most of the time.</p>
<p>A systematic self has an individual identity, which is not dependent on social roles. “Individual” literally means “not divided.” As chief of your inner world, you run the show. You have freedom of choice, rather than being torn between conflicting impulses and relationships. You experience yourself a single being, the same person in every circumstance, throughout your life.</p>
<p>A systematic self enables <dfn>authorship</dfn>, a mode of cultural creativity impossible in the choiceless world. You create as an individual, by manipulating objects in your private internal world, rather than by cooperatively manipulating external objects in the public world. The enormous flowering of culture that started in the Renaissance, and continued through the modern era, depends on such authorship.</p>
<p>Some historians trace the development of the systematic self to the Protestant Reformation, particularly to Calvinism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_208hl98" id="extra29_footnoteref7_208hl98" title="For instance Charles Taylor, in A Secular Age. Other systematic societies developed similar self-technologies, presumably for the same reasons.">7</a> The Calvinist Reformers deliberately created a well-ordered society by disciplining the poor and demanding that even the aristocracy conform to strict religious morality. To make this possible, they developed new technologies of the self. </p>
<p>The Reformers extended to everyone spiritual practices that had been the preserve only of monks. They insisted that <em>everyone</em> examine the contents of their souls, and that everyone should discipline themselves based on what they found there. No longer could you be saved by passively attending church on Sunday. Every layman had to be his own confessor. Individual identity developed from this individual responsibility for salvation. The new, highly-regulated social order and the new, highly-regulated self were mutually supportive.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalism">Eternalism simulates choicelessness</h2>
<p>Systematicity is unnatural—and <em>feels</em> unnatural. Humans evolved in choiceless societies for hundreds of thousands of years. Systematicity began only a few thousand years ago, and it’s mostly only been significant for the past few hundred. Our brains are not adapted for it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_wiinz1w" id="extra29_footnoteref8_wiinz1w" title="An interesting question is to what extent systematicity and brains have co-evolved recently. The cultural evolution of systematicity may exert strong, novel selective pressures, which may affect genetic evolution of brains. Conversely, as innate brain capacities have changed under this pressure, increasingly sophisticated and effective forms of systematicity may become feasible, driving social and cultural evolution.">8</a></p>

[Click for details.]">Eternalism</a> tries to provide some of the comforts of the choiceless mode, within the systematic mode. Eternalism substitutes <a href="#chap32">certainty</a> for choicelessness. If we could be truly certain, we would not have the burden of choice. If everything about culture and social roles were <em>definitely right</em>, we could go back to taking it for granted, without having to reflect on it.</p>
<p>The choiceless mode feels timeless, because you have no awareness of historical change. Eternalism substitutes universality for timelessness; it insists that what is true, is true eternally. But can you believe that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, certainty is a poor substitute for choicelessness. Certainty implies at least the <em>possibility</em> of doubt. It demands belief. In the choiceless mode, doubt is impossible, because belief is unnecessary. You simply do the things your role calls for.</p>

<p>The attraction of most contemporary spiritual systems—from fundamentalist Christianity to <a href="#extra11">SBNR monism</a>—is the implicit promise to return you to the choiceless mode. They lie, though. All they can offer is eternalism, not choicelessness.</p>

<p class="intro_para">Most new ideas are wrong. Most new ways of doing things don’t work. Rationality and science can help sort helpful innovations from harmful or useless ones. However, for nearly all the time humans evolved, those were unavailable.</p>
<p>For our ancestors, it was nearly always a good idea to reject any cultural change. Even now, “we have always done it that way” is often a good reason to continue.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_g0afctj" id="extra29_footnoteref1_g0afctj" title="Some readers will balk at this, because it is often also used to justify the unjustifiable. I find Chesterton’s parable of the fence helpful as insight into why maintaining traditions is useful as a default.">1</a> For this reason, our brains tend to conservatism.</p>
<p>For innovators, the popular preference for tradition is an obstacle. A common, effective strategy is to give the impression that the innovation is not new, but traditional. That hides its risks, costs, or defects, and makes it seem comfortingly safe and acceptable. Historians call this ploy “the invention of tradition,” a phrase introduced in an excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">book by that name↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, every tradition was once an invention. That is not “invention of tradition.” “Invention” here means deliberate deception. It is the presentation of something new as though it were ancient. This may involve explicit falsification of history, or just misleading association of the innovation with symbols of tradition.</p>
<p>Genuine, dramatic progress is also attractive, but hard to come by. Advocates of ideas or practices that have long been marginal—because they don’t actually work well—can dress them up as visionary breakthroughs that will <em>revolutionize everything</em>. For a while, this may bring popular attention and acceptance. This is the mirror image of an invented tradition. </p>
<p>So far as I know, historians haven’t discussed this ploy, and there is no standard term for it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_3jneuhz" id="extra29_footnoteref2_3jneuhz" title="If you know of a discussion in the academic literature, or an accepted term, I’d love to hear about it.">2</a> So, provisionally, I’m calling these “timeworn futures.”</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I’ll discuss some entertaining examples of invented traditions and timeworn futures later in this page.  (Including horse-drawn carriages, kilts, and cranberry sauce.) But first: how is this relevant to <cite>Meaningness</cite>?</p>
<h2 id="extra29_legitimizing">Legitimizing systems</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">↗︎︎</a>
</figure>
<p>Given the serious defects of the <a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a> of understanding meaningness, it is remarkable how successful it was, for how long. </p>
<p>Invented traditions and timeworn futures were key strategies for overcoming psychological resistance to systematicity. For example, the radical new Protestant doctrines were “traditional Christianity, as practiced by the Early Church” (in contrast to the supposed illegitimate innovations of Catholicism). The radical new ethical demands of modern life were “traditional morality.” The radically new bureaucratic state was “the glorious tradition of our nation.” All these descriptions tried to make systematic mode innovations feel <a href="#chap150">choiceless</a>.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, each splinter Protestant sect had a fabulous “new vision” for Godly society; outmoded ethical claims were “spreading rapidly from decent modern people to benighted foreigners and our own lower classes”; and archaic state institutions were “essential foundations for national progress.”</p>
<p>Even after the systematic worldview has <a href="#chap153">collapsed</a> overall, falsifications of both types are still frequently used to justify particular systems.</p>
<p>Invented traditions and timeworn futures are harmful when they justify systems that are worse than alternatives. Arguably, they are benign if they justify systems that are better than alternatives, but which may be rejected for bad reasons. Even then, the deception is dubious.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_countercultures">The countercultures, fabricating pasts and futures</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">

</figure>
<p>As the mainstream collapsed, the <a href="#chap155">1960s–80s countercultures</a> proposed alternative systems. These soon failed, unsurprisingly, because they didn’t have much new to offer.</p>
<p>Both countercultures relied heavily on invented traditions and timeworn futures. However, the dualist counterculture relied particularly heavily on invented traditions, and the monist one on timeworn futures.</p>
<p>The dualist counterculture advocated “restoring traditional American values,” but the glorious past it extolled had never existed. If the movement had succeeded, it would have created a future unlike anything in history. The monist counterculture proclaimed the “Dawning of the Age of Aquarius,” but this timeworn future was straight out of <a href="#extra1">early–1800s German Romantic Idealism</a>.</p>
<p>Each counterculture used the other strategy as well, though. Reagan proclaimed “morning in America.” The New Age justified epic silliness with invented roots in Ancient Egypt, Atlantis, Native American wisdom, Eastern Religions, Mayan prophesies, or just about any time, place, and culture other than 1800s Europe—because Romantic Idealism was thoroughly discredited.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_buddhism">Buddhism: 2000 years of invented traditions</h2>
<p>Reading the history of Buddhism, I gradually realized most of its heroes and events were make-believe. <a href="http://arobuddhism.org/other-teachers/naljorma-rindzin-pamo.html">Rin’dzin Pamo↗︎︎</a> recognized <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Invention of Tradition↗︎︎</a> would explain the motivations of the inventors, and gave me a copy.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://approachingaro.org/back-to-the-future">a narrow aspect of this↗︎︎</a> back in 2009. A couple years later, I discovered David L. McMahan’s book <cite><a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/16/the-making-of-buddhist-modernism/">The Making of Buddhist Modernism↗︎︎</a></cite>, about the invention of “Buddhism” in the late 1800s and early 1900s. I’ve written <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/21/modern-buddhism-forged-as-anti-colonial-weapon/">many↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/">blog↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/">posts↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/07/02/zen-vs-the-u-s-navy/">about↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/07/05/the-king-of-siam-invents-western-buddhism/">that↗︎︎</a>, <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/">and↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/07/09/the-essence-of-all-religions/">plan↗︎︎</a> <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/07/12/what-got-left-out-of-%E2%80%9Cmeditation%E2%80%9D/">to↗︎︎</a> address Buddhist invented traditions more generally soon. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Buddhism <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/12/31/one-dharma-whose/">invented in the 1970s↗︎︎</a> as a synthesis of vintage–1900 Asian modernist Buddhism with the American monist counterculture is <a href="http://fourthturningbuddhism.com/">still presented↗︎︎</a> as a cutting-edge new path. Since the <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/10/nice-buddhism/">weakness↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/12/07/reinventing-buddhist-tantra-badly/">defects↗︎︎</a> of that system have been clear for twenty years, this is a fine example of a timeworn future.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_defense">How to defend against ideological time-distortions</h2>
<p>The only defense against invented traditions and timeworn futures is to study the history of ideas.</p>
<p>This book is partly an attempt to <a href="#chap7">catalog the building-blocks of meaning</a> and help you recognize them. There are surprisingly few genuinely different ideas about meaningness. Timeworn futures just repackage a few, wrapped in shiny up-to-date branding. Invented traditions try to hide something new amidst the familiar, wrapped in reassuringly retro branding.</p>
<p>The final chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Invention of Tradition↗︎︎</a> is titled “Mass-producing Traditions: 1870–1914.” That, plus discovering that Buddhism-as-we-know-it was invented then, made me realize how much of contemporary ideology dates from the period. The era achieved a brilliant, seemingly harmonious synthesis of Protestantism, scientific rationalism, nationalism, industrial capitalism, and Romantic expressivism. It took extraordinary ideological innovations to paper-over contradictions among these—including extensive time-distortions.</p>
<p>I had neglected Victorian ideology as irrelevant: stiff and dull and forgotten by all. But, the story of meaningness since then is mainly just an account of that architecture disintegrating. To make sense of the wreckage we live among, we have to look at historical images of the palace at its peak.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_mythologization">Forthright mythologization in the fluid mode</h2>
<p>It is almost impossible to imagine alternatives to one’s own culture from within. You need to expose yourself to a source of contradiction; of otherness. With the world tending to a global monoculture, pasts are among the few resources we have for innovating futures.</p>
<p>Pasts also have great romantic and aesthetic appeal, so they are effective for communicating and inspiring futures. That is one reason invented traditions work. It is the duplicity of invented traditions that is the main problem, not their creation as such.</p>
<p>I will suggest that non-deceptive creative mythologization, based on an archaeology of meaningness, may be a valuable method in the <a href="#chap175">fluid mode</a>. Myths are sacred fictions we tell about the past to make sense of meaningness in the present, and to point toward futures we hope for (or hope to avoid). Now that we no longer live in the systematic mode, we have no reason to pretend that the myths we make are “true.” We have no compulsion to tell stories that are entirely coherent and well-founded—because we’ve learned that is impossible.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/the-vetalis-gift">romantic fantasy novel↗︎︎</a>, set in India in 700, tries to create an inspiring mythology. It mixes genuine history, contemporary values, and—implicitly—ideas about a future I would like to see.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_royalritual">British royal ritual: an invented history, with motivations</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Scene from the Coronation of King Edward and Queen Alexandra" height="441" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/The_Anointing_of_Queen_Alexandra_at_the_Coronation_of_Edward_VII_560x441.jpg" width="560"/>
</figure>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Invention of Tradition↗︎︎</a> analyzes many examples, which are fascinating and often funny. Most in the book concern the falsification of the traditions of the British kingdoms for nationalist purposes. I’ll describe one of these in some depth, and then a variety of other invented traditions briefly.</p>
<p>The picture above is from the Coronation of King Edward and Queen Alexandra, apparently around the year 1275. The style is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite↗︎︎</a>, a genre of painting from the mid–1800s that emphasized Romantic fantasy themes. Pre-Raphaelite paintings usually feature gorgeous noblewomen in long flowing pseudo-Medieval robes, gothic architecture, and a wizard or king plus maybe a dragon.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_7s4tur1" id="extra29_footnoteref3_7s4tur1" title="They are ridiculous but I love them.">3</a></p>
<p>Britain is, of course, famous for its royal pomp and circumstance; no country does elaborate state occasions better. That is due to its unbroken tradition of royal ritual, going back to Medieval times, as in the picture above.</p>
<p>Not. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_King_Edward_VII_and_Queen_Alexandra">Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra↗︎︎</a> was held in 1902. The “tradition” of British royal ritual had mostly been invented over the previous fifteen years, and the Coronation was mainly new. It was, however, elaborately fake-Medieval. It looked like a Pre-Raphaelite painting—a fantasy of Medieval royal life—because it was imitating a Pre-Raphaelite fantasy.</p>
<p>(The central figure in the background appears to be Merlin, although I suppose he was actually some sort of Anglican Church functionary. Sadly, dragons were already extinct in Britain, so they were not invited.)</p>
<p>Of course, Britain <em>had</em> had genuine royal ritual, presumably for as long as it had had royalty. The point of a coronation ceremony is to get together everyone important to publicly agree that the new king is legitimate and unopposed. This is important because new kings are always opposed, and frequently illegitimate (relative to whatever standard of legitimacy is current). A successful coronation demonstrates that the king has enough power to force everyone to pretend, at least. It sows distrust among the opposition (who have all seen each other giving fealty to the king—so who is to say where anyone’s real loyalty lies?). It also affirms the mutual dependence of the Church and crown, and God’s mandate for rule. If well-executed, coronation works psychological magic (as ritual does), inspiring awe, loyalty, and gratitude in the kingdom’s subjects.</p>
<p>However, for several centuries, Parliament had gradually increased its powers at the expense of kings, with the balance shifting by the late 1600s. Moreover, the British kings from then up to Queen Victoria, who was crowned in 1837, were uniformly defective and unpopular, yet still able to interfere strongly in government.</p>
<p>When Victoria came to the throne, at the age of 18, she was already popular, and a potential threat to Parliamentary power. Parliament therefore engineered a minimal coronation that was both low-key and probably deliberately “shambolic” (as it is often described). This was perhaps the low point of British royal ritual. Nevertheless, Victoria and her husband Prince Albert were popular constitutional monarchs, and exerted considerable political power behind the scenes.</p>
<p>In 1887, Parliament reinvented royal ritual for Victoria’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Jubilee_of_Queen_Victoria">Golden Jubilee↗︎︎</a>, notionally a celebration of her fiftieth year on the throne. This was royal ritual with an entirely new function. It was not, in reality, to confirm the legitimacy of the Queen. Rather, the Jubilee confirmed the legitimacy of new British establishment: Parliament itself, the Anglican Church, industrial capitalism, and the colonial Empire.</p>
<p>The new establishment’s legitimacy was indeed in question, threatened not by the throne, but by even newer forces. At home, populist movements, including socialism, were rapidly gaining support. Abroad, the moral basis for the Empire, and its political and military feasibility, were increasingly dubious.</p>
<p>The Golden Jubilee, and even more the Diamond Jubilee of 1897, were enormous pageants of made-up ceremony, designed to give the impression that the new British establishment was continuous with ancient tradition. Now the aged, ailing, widowed, withdrawn, depressed and drug-addled Queen could be used as a symbol of that continuity, with no risk of any <em>actual</em> continuity of the throne as a power base. Populists were often republican, in favor of abolishing the royalty and House of Lords. So, the Jubilees were meant to create new popularity for the Queen, and by extension the Lords and the rest of the establishment that she notionally headed. They were highly successful.</p>
<p>The Jubilees were not just—or even mainly—British affairs. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-17368499">Diamond Jubilee↗︎︎</a> was a lavish “Festival of the British Empire” designed by the Colonial Secretary. Parliament had declared Victoria <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_India">Empress of India↗︎︎</a>, a newly-invented title, in 1876. That was the pretext for making the Jubilee into a ceremony in which all the colonies gave homage to, in effect, their actual rulers—the British establishment. Ritual festivities were held not only in Britain itself, but throughout the Empire.</p>
<p>Victoria died in 1902, and was succeeded by her son Edward VII—whose Coronation with his wife Queen Alexandra is depicted at the head of this section.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_xmz59b2" id="extra29_footnoteref4_xmz59b2" title="The king doesn’t appear in the picture. It shows the anointing of the queen. “Anointing” means that a shamanic medicine-man smeared sacred gloop on her. Quite what magic that was meant to accomplish, it’s hard to guess. We know, though, that seemingly-senseless rituals of supposedly “primitive” peoples—whether contemporary hunter-gatherers or ancient tribes such as the Victorians—express profound ineffable wisdom, due to their connectedness to the cycles of Nature and openness to the mysteries of Being.">4</a> That grand event was modeled on the Jubilees. Its fake Medievalism suggested eternal stability of British institutions at a time when, in reality, they were changing rapidly. </p>
<p>British royal ritual is now a genuine tradition, having endured for a little more than a century. Here’s a scene from the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1902_State_Landau">the carriage made for Edward VII’s 1902 Coronation↗︎︎</a>. </p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Royal Carriage at Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton" height="457" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/Royal_Carriage_Wedding_of_Prince_William_of_Wales_and_Kate_Middleton_560x457.jpg" width="560"/>
</figure>
<p>That carriage was an invented tradition in 1902; the aristocracy had already abandoned carriages for motorcars, so new ones had to be built for the occasion. Pseudo-Medieval carriages are an authentic tradition now. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Jubilee_State_Coach">most recent one↗︎︎</a> features electric windows, heating, hydraulic stabilizers, and built-in digital copies of important British historical documents. Just in case you need to check the Magna Carta, while being dragged along by six horses, to see how your royal powers are constitutionally limited.</p>
<p>In fact, I suspect that the over-the-top Romantic Medievalism of the 1902 Coronation was partly to underline that the royalty were an absurd archaism, retained only for symbolic value—lest the new king get any ideas.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_tartan">Tartan and kilt</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Scottish national dress" height="700" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/scottish_national_dress_429x700.jpg" width="429"/>
</figure>
<p>A chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Invention of Tradition↗︎︎</a> concerns the invention of Scottish history, culture, and nationality. It was expanded into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0089W2I1U/?tag=meaningness-20">a full book↗︎︎</a>, summarized <a href="http://www.nysun.com/arts/hugh-trevor-ropers-the-invention-of-scotland/82417/">here↗︎︎</a>. Two striking facts concern the invention of the kilt, and of clan tartans, by English businessmen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tartan and kilt, those universal badges of Scottishness, are about as authentic as Disneyland. The kilt was invented by an Englishman, Thomas Rawlinson, who came to Scotland in the 1720s to manage an ironworks in the Highlands. Rawlinson observed that while the actual native costume of the Highlanders—a long belted cloak—might have been suitable for rambling over hills and bogs, it was "a cumbrous, inconvenient habit" for men working at a furnace. So he hired the tailor of the local army regiment to make something more "handy and convenient for his workmen" by separating the skirt from the rest and converting into a distinct garment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clan tartans were invented in the early 1800s by an English textile manufacturer, William Wilson, as a way of expanding the market for his products. Tartans were already common in Scotland, but variations in pattern were regional. It appears to have been Wilson who had the idea that each clan should have its own pattern.</p>
<p>Royal decree imposed unique tartans on the clans in 1822, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visit_of_King_George_IV_to_Scotland">George IV visited Scotland↗︎︎</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott">Sir Walter Scott↗︎︎</a> staged elaborate state pageantry for the king. He invented numerous ancient national traditions for the occasion, deliberately creating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_national_identity#Tartanry">first unified Scottish national identity↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_america">Meanwhile, in America</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving is an entirely invented tradition. Its mythology has accreted gradually, but mainly dates to the late 1800s and the first half of the 1900s. One aspect I find particularly amusing:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been an unchallengeable American doctrine that cranberry sauce, a pink goo with overtones of sugared tomatoes, is a delectable necessity of the Thanksgiving board and that turkey is inedible without it.<br/>—Alistair Cooke</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, because it was served at the First Thanksgiving in 1621. No one actually likes the stuff. (We know this, despite claims to the contrary, because no one eats it except at Thanksgiving.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_oaxb2fk" id="extra29_footnoteref5_oaxb2fk" title="My girlfriend claims to like it, and to have eaten it once outside of Thanksgiving. And she is not even American. So, “hardly anyone.”">5</a>) However, it’s traditional, so one has to pretend.</p>
<p>But actually, there’s no evidence that it was served in 1621. And, the “tradition” was unknown until the 1940s, when it was invented by Ocean Spray, the marketing arm of the cranberry industry. An advertising campaign showed “traditional” Thanksgiving dinners, prominently featuring cranberry sauce. That dramatically increased demand for an agricultural product that is nearly inedible—intensely sour, bitter, fibrous, and otherwise almost tasteless.</p>
<p>And then there’s Christmas.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The first half of the twentieth century was <em>awful</em>. Not just materially; Western systems of meaning—social, cultural, and psychological—were falling apart. The glorious accomplishments of the <a href="#chap151">systematic era</a> could not hold civilization together, and seemed likely to be lost entirely in a global conflagration.</p>
<p>Many people even came to think those systems were the cause of all the catastrophes. We who live in the aftermath—we who have never experienced an intact system—we cannot fully appreciate how awful that loss of meaning felt.</p>
<p>This page analyzes the first phase of meaning’s disintegration, roughly 1914–1964. It should help explain the new positive alternatives offered by the <a href="#chap155">countercultures</a> and <a href="#chap169">subcultures</a>, which came next, and also why those failed.</p>

<p>The period was marked by two social crises: class conflict and world wars. The systematic ideologies that were supposed to resolve these horrible problems seemed, by the end, to have made them worse, or even to have been their principal causes.</p>
<p>Greatly increased division of labor during the 1800s created numerous specialized occupations. This drove great advances in the standard of living and enabled increasing cultural sophistication. However, it also created psychological alienation (discussed below) and social conflicts. The existing social system, which had been stable for hundreds of years, functioned only in an agrarian economy of peasants, aristocratic landowners, and a small class of skilled craftspeople. It had no way of accommodating the newly created classes, such as urban industrial workers and entrepreneurial commoners—who sometimes became richer and more powerful than most aristocrats.</p>
<p>Theorists proposed new systems of social organization: nationalist, socialist, democratic, totalitarian. Advocates made supposedly-rational arguments for why each was <em>right</em>; yet supporters mostly just chose the system that might benefit their in-group against others. Conflicts between them tore societies apart, often even into civil war.</p>
<p>Different countries tried each of the new systems, and all produced vast disasters: </p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>nationalism led to World War I;</li>
<li>capitalism caused the world-wide Great Depression;<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_xrnly4n" id="extra29_footnoteref1_xrnly4n" title="Or, at any rate, this was widely believed.">1</a></li>
<li>fascism was to blame for World War II;</li>
<li>communism killed tens of millions with engineered famines and the mass murder of supposed dissidents.</li>
</ul>
<p>WWI marked the end of naive faith in the systematic mode. Most countries went into the war confident of quick victory, confident of its necessity and ethical rightness, confident that war was an opportunity for glory, heroism, and unity. God was on our side. </p>
<p>For Europe, it was the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_warfare">industrial war↗︎︎</a>,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_d0jf0hp" id="extra29_footnoteref2_d0jf0hp" title="The American Civil War was the first industrial war overall, anticipating most of the features of WWI on a smaller—but still appalling—scale.">2</a> with the new social and mechanical technologies of mass production turning out deaths instead of automobiles. Four years later, after tens of millions of casualties, extraordinary horror and suffering, the traumatized survivors asked not “was it worth it” but “what was <em>that</em> all about, anyway?” </p>
<p>In retrospect, WWI seemed completely pointless. Or, if it had any meaning, it was to point out that the pre-war systems of meaning must have been disastrously wrong. The 1800s had seemed an era of rapid <em>moral</em> progress as well as economic and scientific progress. That was no longer credible. This disillusionment increased support for alternatives, including socialist internationalism, fascism, explicit anti-modernism, and explicit nihilism.</p>
<p>One pointless, catastrophic world war might be a tragic accident. To fight another, even worse one—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_anthropogenic_disasters_by_death_toll">worst human-created disaster ever↗︎︎</a>—just twenty years later, goes beyond carelessness. When the victors of WWII immediately began preparing to fight WWIII among themselves—this time with potentially billions of deaths from nuclear weapons—it was widely regarded as <em>a bad idea</em>. Yet Cold War belligerents on both sides felt justified by their systems of meaning: benevolent socialist internationalism versus benevolent liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Systematicity itself was a major cause of the catastrophe. Leaders and peoples took their rational ideologies far too seriously, and acted on flawed theoretical prescriptions. </p>
<p>Why did they choose not to see the systems were failing? <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

<p>From the standpoint of each ideology, the others looked nihilistic:</p>
<ul>
<li>For democratic capitalism, communism and fascism looked nihilistic in denying civil and human rights and the ultimate value of the individual.</li>
<li>For communism, capitalism and fascism denied the ultimate value of solidarity—the brotherhood of all—and the economic rights of the working class.</li>
<li>For fascism, the economic focus of communism and capitalism denied all values other than material ones. They denied the ultimate value of nation-state-ethnicity. They subordinated the noble, high culture of the elite to the vulgar, degenerate culture of the rabble.</li>

And, indeed, many thought the World Wars <em>were</em> the nihilist apocalypse—although in reality they were caused far more by eternalism than nihilism.

Among these were forerunners of the countercultures, such as the existentialists and Beats.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_e56dxkm" id="extra29_footnoteref3_e56dxkm" title="Around the same time—1951—Kenneth Arrow proved mathematically that there is no such thing as a “fair” system of government.

<p>While the systematic mode worked—up to WWI—the role of “high” culture was to express and reinforce the values of the system. Great art was, by definition, morally improving. The arts tried to be pure, inspiring, and uplifting. They provided an idealized vision of the smooth workings of meaning as it was meant to be.</p>
<p>High culture expressed the sacred eternal values of the elites—the “bourgeoise”—who were its patrons. Popular culture sometimes ignored or mocked elite values; but that was ephemeral rubbish.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 1800s, and accelerating after WWI, artists flipped all that on its head. High art began instead to expose the cracks in the system. It articulated the widely-felt sense of disintegration, of <a href="#chap154">loss of certainty</a>. It spoke to the anxiety, confusion, and even horror that came from the failure of all foundations; but also the freedom and joy that came with liberation from eternalism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_jn29upn" id="extra29_footnoteref4_jn29upn" title="This movement in the arts was called “modernism”. As I mentioned earlier, in other contexts “modern” refers to different periods. In particular, “modernism” in the arts corresponds to the breakdown of the “modernity” that prevailed from the 1400s through the 1800s.">4</a></p>
<p>Artists, in all media, systematically rejected past artistic systems, and the rational structures that justified them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_zo3egqw" id="extra29_footnoteref5_zo3egqw" title="Artistic modernism grew out of Romanticism. Romantic art was sometimes explicitly anti-rational, but still mainly worked within the Classical forms. It maintained strong emotional coherence, and was more-or-less realistic. Generally it also supported existing social structures, or at most sought to reform them, rather than destroy them.">5</a> Painters rejected geometrical perspective, the great achievement of Renaissance art. Composers rejected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonality">tonality↗︎︎</a>, which had been the foundation of music for several centuries, and experimented with severe dissonances. Writers abandoned grammar, punctuation, prosody, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_Absurd">sense↗︎︎</a>, and all other “restrictive” forms.</p>
<p>At the extreme, the arts became entirely anti-sense, incoherent, or explicitly nihilistic. (This anticipates the incoherence of the <a href="#chap173">atomized mode</a> most of a century later.) Artists <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_painting">hurled globs of paint↗︎︎</a> at a canvas; composers arranged notes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music">by rolling dice↗︎︎</a>; writers cut individual words out of a book, shook them up, pulled ones out at random and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique">called the result↗︎︎</a> a poem.

</figure>
<p>High art also increasingly rejected all existing social systems. Biting the hands that fed it, it adopted the attitude <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89pater_la_bourgeoisie">épater la bourgeoisie↗︎︎</a></i>: scandalize polite society!</p>
<p>The new job of art was not to uplift, but to overthrow. Eventually, you could not be a serious artist unless you constantly proclaimed your contempt and hatred for the middle and upper classes, for capitalism, for Victorian morality, for religion, for any sort of taboo or restriction. To be an artist was <em>by definition</em> to be a revolutionary. Simply <a href="#chap135">maintaining an oppositional attitude</a> became sufficient; art and social critique became inseparable.</p>
<p>Popular and high art now changed places. The middle and working classes had growing spending power, and entrepreneurs discovered that popular culture could be profitable. Commercial culture came to represent the “traditional values” of the systematic mode, where high art—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde">avant-garde↗︎︎</a>—satirized and undermined them.

<p>Here began the “<a href="#chap157">culture war</a>,” which became particularly important in the <a href="#chap155">countercultural mode</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_self">The self in crisis</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg"><div class="youtube_outer_wrapper"><div class="youtube_inner_wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="youtube" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IjarLbD9r30?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div></div></figure>
<p class="ctrimgcaption">Charlie Chaplin, <cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_%28film%29">Modern Times↗︎︎</a></cite>, 1936</p>
<p>Systematic society required, and made partially possible, <a href="#chap151_self">systematic selves</a>. Systematic persons were rational individuals who conformed to, and enforced, systematic social values. This advance began breaking down in the first half of the twentieth century, due to systematicity’s harmful side-effects. Its requirements came to seem oppressive, meaningless, and for some, impossible. Selves fractured and broke under the stress.</p>
<p>Work in the industrial economy felt dehumanizing. Extreme division of labor made most people tiny, interchangeable cogs in a vast, incomprehensible, relentless machine. The functioning of the economy as a whole became opaque, so it was impossible to see the meaning of one’s own work, and the system’s demands seemed senseless. And, indeed, working conditions often were not only awful, but pointlessly awful.</p>
<p>Urban, industrial social organization increasingly alienated people from each other and from nature. The systematic self—based on a rigorous self/other boundary—made this worse, and even separated people from their own everyday experience. It became possible, for the first time, to feel lonely and isolated while in a crowd.</p>
<p>The mid–1800s introduced a new “Victorian” sexual morality and a new culture of the family. These addressed genuine social problems with some success. In the absence of reliable contraceptive technology, and limited food production, sexual restraint lessened the rate at which children died of starvation. The new concept of a private home life developed partly as refuge from the stresses of the work world, and was closely analogous to the new enclosed interiority of the systematic self.</p>
<p>However, these innovations also caused stress and misery for many people. For example, England had large, persistent surpluses of women, making it mathematically impossible for all to conform to the demand that they marry. Many people (men and women, adults and children) found the regimented ideology of duty-filled family relationships an onerous grind at best, and in some cases intolerable. Yet they were nearly inescapable. The newly private nuclear family could also conceal pathology and abuse that earlier, more open extended families might have successfully intervened in.</p>
<p>Increasing social complexity requires you to act as several different people in different places. Some of those partial-selves are false fronts; others may seem natural. If your personality is quite different at work and at home, which is the real you?</p>
<p id="extra29_ecstasy">Ecstasy is the natural antidote to the sense that administering the systematic self—holding everything together—is exhausting. <a href="#chap150">Choiceless</a> cultures periodically celebrate with joyful non-ordinary states of consciousness, produced by community ritual, intoxicants, and relaxation of social role norms. Systematic cultures deliberately banned these as threats.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_yhnid6p" id="extra29_footnoteref6_yhnid6p" title="Calvinism pioneered this move, but you see the same in communist prudery, for example. Romanticism, in both the artistic and spiritual realms, revolted against puritanism—and so was a precursor to the 1960s counterculture.">6</a> Even this temporary escape route was cut off.</p>
<p>Many people began to ask: Why? For what? Given the rigidities of the system, even the best possible life outcomes would be quite unsatisfactory for most people. The restrictions seemed arbitrary, unnecessary, and unfair. When you ask “why?”, a system is supposed to always have an answer; but as the twentieth century staggered from crisis to catastrophe to breakdown, religious and political platitudes no longer seemed adequate. Rationalist certainty had <a href="#chap154">also collapsed</a>. Justifications based on abstraction and generality are sterile; when the systems they support are visibly failing, they come to seem meaningless.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/nihilist-anxiety">anxiety of relativism↗︎︎</a>, as eternalism disintegrates, one doubts everything. Yet the system has to reject doubters. They are criminal, mad, degenerate, lazy, undesirable; and punished or cast out accordingly. What then? Perhaps I <em>am</em> mad? Or a criminal? Perhaps “good” and “evil” no longer have any meaning? Perhaps meaning itself is impossible…</p>
<p id="extra29_self_problems">And so there developed new words for problems of the self, reflecting the new possibility of nihilism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alienation, in the mismatch between social roles and internal experience</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie">Anomie↗︎︎</a>, the feeling that social norms have broken down and become irrelevant</li>
<li>Neurosis, theorized to be caused by failure to adapt to stifling social requirements</li>
<li>Identity crisis, the feeling of loss of any meaningful self</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_crisis#Cultural_contexts">Existential angst↗︎︎</a>, the feeling accompanying nihilistic doubt</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people adapted easily enough to systematic requirements, and constructed reasonably functional systematic selves. Others found it difficult, and were miserable; some failed altogether.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_hb97w4x" id="extra29_footnoteref7_hb97w4x" title="Of course, success in adapting to systematic requirements depended both on one’s personal capacity and predilections, and on one’s position in the social structure.">7</a> In breakdown, the self is experienced as fragmented, incoherent, and hostile to itself.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Freud" height="599" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/Sigmund_Freud_426x599.jpg" width="426"/>
</figure>
<p id="extra29_Freud">Freud’s enormous influence during the first half of the twentieth century was due to his pioneering explanations—however incomplete and incorrect—of these problems.</p>
<p>A fully systematic self, he argued, is biologically impossible. The ideal of the self as the rational chief of a smoothly functioning internal bureaucracy is unrealizable. Not only is the self not an in-dividual, it is always actually divided. Most of what happens inside ourselves we cannot even know about: it is unconscious. The ego—what we most think of as self—is a hapless clown, caught between vastly more powerful forces.</p>
<p>The monstrous, irrational, amoral, chaotic id mainly does as it pleases; then the tyrannical, persecutory superego punishes us for desires and acts beyond our control, inducing constant anxiety and guilt. The ego’s mechanisms of defense against them, such as repression, denial, regression, and projection, are themselves mainly violent failures of rational self-management. They mirror the mechanisms of social oppression.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D2ZZ6K4/?tag=meaningness-20">Civilization and Its Discontents↗︎︎</a> (1930), perhaps Freud’s most influential work, argued that because the conflict between social demands and individual desires was unavoidable, deep dissatisfaction was inescapable. The best we can hope for is to “replace neurotic misery with common unhappiness.”</p>
<p>Despite this profoundly gloomy conclusion, psychoanalysis functioned as a para-religion for millions of people. As a system for making sense of meaning in all its <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss6')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a>, it often fit lived experience better than Christianity.</p>
<p>During the middle of the century, psychoanalysis evolved away from orthodox Freudianism, in several productive directions. Object-relations theory recognized that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott">relationships had great human value↗︎︎</a>, not just instrumentally but intrinsically. It also developed more sophisticated and accurate understandings of the internal structure of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn">the self and its fragmentation↗︎︎</a>. Psychoanalysis also hybridized with existentialism, arguably deepening each. Both hybridized with Marxism, producing trenchant new analyses of the failures of the systematic mode, and suggesting new revolutionary possibilities. These were a major impetus for the 1960s–70s counterculture.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_responses">Responses: totalitarianism and existentialism</h2>
<p>The main alternative, while all systems were failing, appeared to be nihilism—the end of meaning. However, two other responses developed during 1914–64: totalitarianism and existentialism.</p>
<p>These had some of the characteristics of countercultures, as I’ll define them on the next page. Both proposed alternatives to the failing mainstream, and were often anti-rational.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_zyd80h5" id="extra29_footnoteref8_zyd80h5" title="On the other hand, fascist ethno-nationalism was not exactly universalist, where the 1960s–80s countercultures were; and communism at least pretended to rationality.">8</a> Each contributed to counterculturalism: existentialism especially influenced the monist counterculture, and totalitarianism the dualist counterculture.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_totalitarianism">Totalitarianism</h3>
<p>By “totalitarianism” I mean attempts to make a system work by force. (This is not quite the standard definition, but it’s close.) This includes fascism, actually-existing communism,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_88kxycn" id="extra29_footnoteref9_88kxycn" title="Some communists argue that all supposed communist regimes were not really communist, and true communism would not be totalitarian. I find this unconvincing, but have added “actually-existing” to avoid arguing about it. I wonder whether anyone argues that true fascism would not be totalitarian?">9</a> and theocractic fundamentalism.</p>
<p>Totalitarianism is now mostly discredited in the West, so it’s important to understand why it made sense in the mid-twentieth century—and why it still makes sense to billions of people elsewhere.</p>
<p>Any serious system has a network of justifications that answer all “why” questions—not perfectly, but well enough for most people most of the time. So it <em>ought</em> to work. Moreover, systems mostly <em>did</em> work, for several centuries. Even in the 1950s, many liberal Western economists and political scientists considered that the Soviet bloc had an unfair advantage, because its leaders could simply order everyone to do what had to be done. They favored democratic institutions on ethical grounds, but believed that communism was more efficient economically—so the West might be doomed. (It wasn’t until the 2000s that the reasons non-systematic economies outperform started to be commonly understood.)</p>
<p>Like all eternalism, totalitarianism is based on the <a href="#chap34">fantasy of control</a>; it promises salvation if you conform to the dictates of the system. That promise is <a href="#chap31">enormously appealing</a>, and explains why Hitler, Stalin, and Mao had broad popular support—and why Islamic fundamentalism has broad popular support now.</p>
<p>The totalitarian intuition is that society would work if everyone just did what they were supposed to. And this is largely correct. Despite nearly opposite ideologies, Norway and Singapore are now among the highest-functioning countries in the world, because there is a general agreement among their citizens to do the right thing. In low-functioning countries, there is a <i>de facto</i> agreement to ignore pro-social norms in favor of personal or clan advancement. So why not just <em>make</em> everyone behave?</p>
<p>Totalitarianism’s flaws become apparent when it collides with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss8')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>. It then uses all the <a href="#chap38">eternalist ploys</a> to maintain allegiance in the face of failure. Most obviously, totalitarianism is <a href="#chap47">armed and armored</a> to restore order by force. This requires <a href="#chap55">purification</a>, eventually by killing everyone who impedes the operation of the system (kulaks, Jews, apostates, profiteers, perverts, oppressors, idolators, elitists, degenerates, running-dog capitalist-roaders, intellectuals, counter-revolutionaries, etc.). Totalitarian leadership is typically addicted to <a href="#chap41">magical thinking</a> and <a href="#chap43">pretending</a> to <a href="#chap48">believe</a>. For the masses, they encourage <a href="#chap49">thought suppression</a> and <a href="#chap46">kitsch</a>.</p>

<p id="extra29_totalitarian_kitsch">Speaking of kitsch, all totalitarian movements see it as <em>job one</em> to suppress and destroy avant-garde art.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_4uicjk0" id="extra29_footnoteref10_4uicjk0" title="Not coincidentally, my page on eternalist kitsch draws heavily on Kundera’s analysis of totalitarian kitsch.">10</a> Avant-garde art points to nebulosity and mocks systematicity—as such, not just specific systems. The Soviets declared it “counter-revolutionary,” and made “socialist realism” the only legal style. (That was state-worshipping propaganda kitsch in a style crudely imitating late–1800s Academic painting.) The Nazis declared the avant-garde “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art">degenerate↗︎︎</a>,” “nonsensical,” and “Jewish,” and banned it in favor of their own Classically-inspired propaganda kitsch. Nowadays, fundamentalists preach against it, ban it where they can, and promote religious kitsch.</p>
<p>In the social realm, I mentioned two problems: class conflict and world war. Totalitarianism deals with the first by banning it. (That was easy, wasn’t it? If you kill everyone responsible for class conflict, it will just go away.) Totalitarians <em>love</em> world wars—eternalism deludes them that they are fated to win and establish a global Soviet / Reich / Caliphate<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_dq3x55d" id="extra29_footnoteref11_dq3x55d" title="As I write this, ISIS—the global caliphate—is just about to conquer Rome. According to the caliph, as quoted in his press releases today, anyway.">11</a>—so that’s not a problem either.</p>
<p>Totalitarianism requires a self that is systematic but transparent. <a href="#chap150">Choiceless</a> selves—embedded in local community relationships—cannot conform to the will of a national or global system. Individuals—who have a private mental realm—may choose to resist the system, or hide dissenting thoughts from the system. The totalitarian self must be submerged in the State, or surrendered to God, renouncing personal boundaries. That is attractive, for many people, by relieving them of the burdens of choice. (Eternalism <a href="#chap151_eternalism">simulates choicelessness</a>.) However, complete surrender is impossible to accomplish, which is one reason totalitarianism has not been more successful.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_existentialism">Existentialism</h3>
<p>Existentialism rejected all systems of meaning in favor of choosing personal meanings. I’ve analyzed that extensively earlier in the book,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_6tzw3f9" id="extra29_footnoteref12_6tzw3f9" title="Actually, as of the time I’m writing this early in 2015, those sections of the book exist only as notes, and do not yet appear on the web. Existentialism is relevant to many of the themes of Meaningness, and I will discuss it in—at minimum—the chapters on meaningfulness, boundaries, self, and purpose.">12</a> so here I’ll say only a little.</p>
<p>Systematic eternalism tries to make meaning objective. During the twentieth century, this became obviously unworkable. Many saw nihilism as the only possible alternative, but (rightly) considered it unacceptable. Existentialists tried to create a third possibility: that meaning could be subjective rather than objective. In fact, they said, “authentic” meaning <em>had</em> to be subjective: a purely individual choice or creation, without any justification. They claimed that perfect internal freedom of choice made this possible, whatever the external circumstances.</p>
<p>This can’t work. Meaning is a collaborative activity. It is <a href="#chap110">neither objective nor subjective</a>. It is created by interaction, and abides in that space-between. Also, we do not have perfect internal freedom. Selves are constituted by biology and by society and culture. People cannot become ideal independent rational agents with perfectly-crisp boundaries and unlimited free will.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, while advocating total rejection of social values, several of the most important existentialists also advocated totalitarian social systems. For example, Heidegger supported Nazism and Sartre supported Soviet communism. Camus, last and best of the existentialists, was left to diagnose both its failure modes. He explained how purely subjective meaning slides into nihilism, split with Sartre over communism, and consistently denounced totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, existentialism’s incoherent combination of extreme individualism and extreme collectivism carried on into the countercultures a couple decades later. That was a main reason for their failure.</p>

<p class="intro_para">For centuries, the <a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a> provided <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, based on <a href="#chap33">illusory understandings</a> of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

Its certainty and understandings rested on two foundations: the Christian Church and scientific rationality. In the early 1900s, both failed.</p>
<p>Everyone knows a little about one half of the story: how science
undermined religious belief, but failed to provide an alternative
basis for meaning.</p>
<p>Less well known is the story of how rationalist certainty ended; how
it dug too deep, and undermined its own foundations. After a series of
crises, the inescapable conclusion was that mathematics and physics
cannot supply the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss1')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimate</a> justifications that seemed possible
in the 1800s.</p>
<p>I believe this was a major factor in the <a href="#chap153">breakdown of the systematic
mode</a> and eventual collapse of all systems
of meaning. That is not widely recognized, perhaps for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since we have lived without rationalist certainty for nearly a
 century, it is difficult now to appreciate the shock and terror its
 loss provoked at the time.</li>
<li>It was only the cognitive elites who fully understood and felt the
 loss. As the mass media explained that there was a problem, only a
 vague anxiety that science no longer made sense trickled down.</li>
<li>Mathematicians and scientists have mostly learned to live with
 ambiguity and incoherence.</li>
<li>The consequences have still not been fully felt, because
 <a href="#chap63">rationalist eternalism</a> is still
 common—even though it is known to be unworkable.</li>
<li>The loss of rationalist certainty was deliberately misinterpreted by
 anti-rationalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalists', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

 woo, and so on. The dualist version is Christian (or Islamic or
 dualist-Hindu) woo. The general reasoning is: “rationality has
 failed, therefore it can’t rule out our metaphysical dogmas,
 therefore our dogmas are Ultimate Truth.” Monist irrationalism
 justifies <a href="#extra1">Idealism</a> and the

</ul>
<p>The end of rationalist certainty was not one event. It came as a
series of unexpected, unwanted discoveries, throughout the first half
of the twentieth century. A full account would take a long book. Here
I will cover only some key events: non-Euclidean geometry, relativity,
quantum, and the foundational crisis in mathematics caused by problems
with infinities.</p>
<p>Most people probably know that relativity and quantum came as shocks,
but maybe not quite why. The crisis in mathematics is less known, but
perhaps more important, because it was even more fundamental.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The <dfn>countercultural mode</dfn> of the 1960s-80s marked the final attempts to rescue the <a href="#chap151">glory of systems</a> from the maw of <a href="#chap153">nihilistic collapse</a>. It failed, and we live in its wreckage.</p>
<p>It would be polite to say “enduring influence” but I’d rather call it “wreckage.” As <a href="#chap153">civilization burned</a>, we built two vast, fantastical, ornate galleons as escape ships. But they were not the slightest bit sea-worthy; and they collided and broke up in the harbor. The crash left a floating mass of broken spars and tangled lines, choking access to the exit.</p>
<p>Millions of people are still trying to live on that flotsam, so you call across: “It’s a pile of water-logged junk; the rest will sink soon; why don’t you come join us in our fleet of nimble new watercraft?” They jeer that your pathetic little boats are made of plastic, and you say “it’s not plastic, it’s a kevlar composite kayak,” and so on.</p>
<p>This is a metaphor for the <a href="#chap148">development of modes of meaningness</a> over the past half-century. “Kayaks” will become clear only when I get to the <a href="#chap175">fluid mode</a>. But let’s talk galleons: the two countercultures.</p>
<p>I define the <dfn>countercultural mode of meaningness</dfn> as:</p>
<p class="display_para">Developing a new, alternative, universalist, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

<!--break-->
<h2>Goals for this discussion</h2>
<p>The <em>content</em> of the countercultures is still all around us: rock concerts and televangelists, for instance. Such content is familiar to everyone, and needs no review.</p>
<p>The <em>structure</em> and <em>function</em> of the countercultures may be less understood. What problems did they address, and how were their solutions supposed to work? In what ways did they succeed and fail, and why? That is my topic here.</p>
<p>One goal is to understand the continuing influence of the countercultures, and especially the way their “<a href="#chap167">culture war</a>” has polarized Western societies. I will suggest that much of this polarization is due to a pervasive misunderstanding of the structure and function of the countercultures. Better understanding might help heal the rift. The two had much more in common than they recognized—both in terms of what was right about them, and what was wrong. They were both good-faith attempts to rescue <a href="#chap151">systematic eternalism</a>, using similar methods. That was impossible, however, and they both failed for the same reasons.</p>
<p>The following mode, the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultural mode', 'gloss1')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

[Click for details.]">subcultural mode</a>, can only be analyzed as a response to countercultural failure—so the failure must be understood. The subcultural and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomized', 'gloss2')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet. The atomized mode resembles nihilism because systems of meaning are impossible. There are no standards for comparing value, so everything seems equally trivial, and equally a crisis. However, whereas the threat of nihilism is the loss of all meaning, the atomized world delivers far too much meaning, in a jumbled stream of bite-sized morsels, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. [Click for details.]">atomized</a> modes also failed, so we still have most of the same problems—but in different forms, because each mode has transformed <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss3')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

<p>The countercultural mode is “native” only for the Baby Boom generation. It is very different from the subcultural and atomized modes, native to Generations X and Y. One goal of this <a href="#chap148">whole history of meaningness</a> is to help give people in each generation access to each other’s way of processing meaning.</p>
<h2>Overview of the section</h2>
<p>I’ll begin by <a href="#chap156">expanding on the definition</a> “new, alternative, universalist, eternalist, anti-rational systems,” showing how the two countercultures fit each part of that.</p>
<p>“<em>The</em> counterculture” generally refers to the youth movement of the 1960s to early 1970s. The idea that the American “Christian conservative” movement of the late 1970s and 1980s was also a counterculture may seem implausible at first. It <a href="#chap157">does fit that definition</a>, however.</p>
<p>I will suggest that the two countercultures are best understood as <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss4')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monist</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualist', 'gloss5')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a>, respectively. You might call them “leftist” and “rightist,” but those words are not well-defined. In fact, “left” and “right” changed their meanings during the countercultural era, in what I will describe as a “<a href="#chap162">ninety degree clockwise rotation</a>.”</p>
<p>Both countercultures attempted to <a href="#chap159">address the problems of meaningness</a> caused by the <a href="#chap153">failure of the systematic mode</a> during the first half of the 20th century. Although the <em>content</em> of their proposed solutions were often opposed, the <em>structure</em> was the same. Both attempted to create a new, optimistic, revitalized systematicity, by <a href="#chap160">rejecting rationality</a> and developing new religious technologies of the self. Both sought to reform society by <a href="#extra15">collapsing the distinction</a> between the personal and the political.</p>
<p>Both countercultures used the <a href="#chap152">time distortion tricks</a> of “invented traditions” and “timeworn futures” to make their dubious proposals seem more attractive. The “hippie” counterculture pretended to be progressive, but mainly recycled early-1800s Romanticism; the “Moral Majority” counterculture pretended to be traditional, but had a radical modern agenda. These deliberate deceptions account for some of the acrimony of the <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>.</p>
<p>Although both countercultures developed impressively <a href="#chap165">thick and wide</a> approaches to problems of meaning, <a href="#chap166">both failed</a>, for the same reason. Systematicity can never succeed on its own terms; it cannot be absolute. Reality is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss6')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>, and systems cannot fully grasp its variability. The <dfn>universalism</dfn> of the countercultures was their undoing. They could not accommodate the growing demand for cultural, social, and psychological diversity. Subcultures could, and did.</p>
<p>I find understanding the countercultures as monist and dualist helpful, in the light of my earlier analysis of what is right and wrong in these two <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stances', 'gloss7')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness.

<p>The discussion here is America-centric, because that’s what I know best. Much of it applies to other countries, but details differ.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_new">New</h2>
<p>After the nightmare of WWII, everyone was exhausted, and just wanted everything to <em>go back to normal</em> for a while. “Normal” would mean the <a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a> functioning smoothly; and the 1950s were dedicated to making that happen. But none of the <a href="#chap153">problems of meaningness</a> from the first half of the century had gone away. Beneath the veneer of normality, the cracks in the systems were still widening.</p>
<p>Both countercultures were motivated by disgust at the hypocrisy of the mainstream. The mainstream’s relatively smooth functioning was based on <a href="#chap43">eternalistic pretending</a>. In fact, mainstream society, culture, and self now failed to provide meaning. They had been rotted from within by <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

[Click for details.]">eternalistic</a> forms that concealed fundamental corruption. Shell-shocked, these systems were going through the motions with a business-as-usual attitude, but without authentic commitment.</p>
<p>Both countercultures perceived a pervasive moral breakdown in the mainstream, caused by <a href="#chap153">loss of meaning</a>, although they disagreed about specific values.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_alternative">Alternative</h2>
<p>The countercultures considered tinkering around the edges inadequate. They proposed wholesale replacement of mainstream society, culture, and self with alternative systems. They defined themselves point-by-point in contrast with the mainstream; that opposition was the <i>counter</i> in counterculture.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, “alternative” was a synonym for “monist counterculture,” in fact. An “alternative bookstore” sold New Age books; an “alternative grocer” sold alfalfa sprouts and tofu. Both were organized as anarchist collectives. The dualist counterculture positioned itself as the alternative to a society whose institutions had been captured by degenerate liberalism. It particularly opposed decisions by the American Supreme Court such as <cite>Roe v. Wade</cite> (abortion), <cite>Engel v. Vitale</cite> (school prayer) and <cite>Bob Jones University</cite> (racial discrimination). Both countercultures used the rhetoric of <a href="#chap135">romantic rebellion</a> against illegitimate authority to motivate followers.</p>
<p>The subcultures, by contrast, were not interested in replacing the mainstream; they just wanted to be left alone to do their own thing. In fact, during most of the subcultural era, there <em>was</em> no mainstream. The many subcultures were different from each other, but they were not “alternative.”</p>
<h2 id="extra29_universalist">Universalist</h2>
<p>Universalism—the claim that what is right, is right for everyone, everywhere, eternally—is a key feature of the systematic mode. The countercultures retained it: both proposed universalist alternatives. The monist counterculture said that <em>everyone</em> should recycle, get over their sexual hangups, and expand their consciousness. The dualist counterculture said that <em>everyone</em> should go to church, save it for marriage, and pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Universalism proved to be the countercultures’ undoing. It became apparent in the 1980s that neither counterculture could command a majority. People are unfixably <em>diverse</em>, and different people want all sorts of different social, cultural, and personal arrangements.</p>
<p>The subcultural mode abandoned universalism; that was its foremost difference from the countercultural mode.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_eternalist">Eternalist</h2>
<p>Both countercultures tried to rescue systematic <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

Punk was the first subculture; the Sex Pistols’ “I am an antichrist / I am an anarchist / I don’t know what I want / But I know how to get it / I want to destroy the passerby” blew counterculturalism to bits.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_antirational">Anti-rational</h2>
<p>Both countercultures explicitly rejected rationality, which had been a foundation of the systematic mode. All possible rational bases for systems had been tried, and had failed. Rationality had shown that meaning was neither objective nor subjective, which was misunderstood as implying <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a>, ecological devastation, abortion, and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>New anti-rational religious movements organized meanings for both countercultures. The hippie counterculture ransacked history to find and revive monist spiritual systems. They adopted “Eastern religions,” plus vintage-1800 <a href="#extra1">German Romantic Idealism</a>, which was repackaged as “the New Age” to disguise its unsavory origins. The dualist counterculture replaced rationalized mainline Christianity with wacky fundamentalist, charismatic, and dispensationalist innovations.</p>
<p>On both sides, these new religions promoted supernatural practices and transformative inner experiences (“enlightenment” and “being born again”). They deemphasized or dropped codes of conduct and doctrine.</p>
<p>Subcultures, having set aside the failed quest for ultimacy and universality, did not need to take any particular position on rationality. With the countercultures having passed, there is room for the <a href="#chap175">fluid mode</a> to reclaim a relativized, non-foundational, pragmatic rationality.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_systems">Systems</h2>
<p>The monist counterculture claimed to offer revolutionary new ideas, and both it and the dualist one made some genuine innovations, but neither broke away from the fundamental paradigm of systematicity. At their best, they offered new, different systems. However, it was systematicity itself that was fatally flawed; and so the countercultures sank.</p>
<p>Subculturalism stepped away from systematicity—or what many historians call “modernity.” The countercultural era was modernity’s last gasp, and the subcultures the first breath of postmodernity.</p>

<p>A second movement shared “the” counterculture’s abstract features—its structure and function.

<h2 id="extra29_monism_dualism">Monism, dualism, and the countercultures</h2>
<p>“Left” and “right” would be the obvious names for the two countercultures, but that could be misleading. These terms are not well-defined, and <a href="#chap162">had different meanings</a> during the countercultural era than they did before or after.</p>
<p>Our current left and right <em>like</em> to be called “progressive” and “traditional”; and the countercultures might have liked that too. However, I <a href="#chap163">will suggest</a> that this characterization is a deliberately misleading fiction, promoted by both.</p>
<p>It would be more accurate to cast the countercultures in religious terms, as “holism” versus “holiness.” Or, in ethical terms, as “permissive” versus “restrictive”; or in social terms as “egalitarian” versus “respecting hierarchical differences.”</p>

<p>This page explains what made the “hippie” counterculture monist, first; and then what made the “Moral Majority” counterculture dualist. We’ll see also that the monist counterculture had some dualist elements; and that the dualist counterculture tacitly accepted some “hippie” monist boundary-blurrings.</p>
<p>Much of this material is controversial. Reading it, you may have strong emotional reactions, categorizing particular countercultural moves as <a href="#chap35_beyond">good or bad</a>. I would suggest trying to suspend such judgements. Each had, I think, both good and bad <em>effects</em>.</p>
<p>I hope you will recognize that I do not support either counterculture against the other. I find some aspects of each attractive, and some repellent. Overall, it is most important to understand why both were wrong, and <a href="#chap166">both failed</a>. But it is also valuable to understand what was right in each, and what might be worth saving from their wreckage.</p>
<p>On this page, I go into the history of the dualist counterculture in somewhat more detail, because it’s probably less well-known to most readers, and because I’ve written about the monist-countercultural religious left <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/09/23/buddhist-ethics-is-a-fraud/">extensively elsewhere↗︎︎</a>. If I seem critical of the 1980s Religious Right here, I assure you that I was just as hostile to the monist left there.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_monist_monist">How the monist counterculture was monist</h2>
<p>The specific contents of the monist counterculture—from recycling to Vietnam war protests—are familiar. Less obvious is the general pattern: that the specifics reflect the monist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss15" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss15')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness.

It attempted to dissolve many particular boundaries, on the theory that they were illegitimate, alienating, and needlessly limiting. I’ll discuss these boundary erasures here only briefly. Some I’ve explained earlier in the book; many, I’ll return to in greater detail later.</p>
<p>Psychedelic drugs were a cornerstone of the counterculture; boundary-blurring is one of their major effects. They can give a sense of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss17" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimate', 'gloss17')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness.

This is difficult and rare; perhaps psychologically impossible. [Click for details.]">accomplishment</a> of the monist stance. Short of that, they often melt distinctions of all sorts. It’s common, for instance, to have experiences of the commonality of all people, of humans with other creatures, and of the animate and inanimate.</p>
<p>Ecology—a new science—revealed that all life is connected in an intricate web of mutual dependencies. A cultural and political movement based on it began with Rachel Carson’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H1UELS/?tag=meaningness-20">Silent Spring↗︎︎</a> in 1962. Taking the unification of concerns a step further, countercultural theorist Theodore Roszak promoted “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0595297471/?tag=meaningness-20">ecopsychology↗︎︎</a>,” collapsing the distinctions among the natural, political, psychological, and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>When you have experienced your intimate sameness with a tree, it is hard to take seriously human categories such as religions, nations, and races. The political universalism of the counterculture—the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, feminism—was based in this monist conception of human commonality.</p>
<p>The feminist slogan “the personal is political” expressed the essence of monist politics. The private/public boundary, a foundational principle for Victorian systematicity, disintegrated. The distinction between ethics (“ought” in the personal realm) and politics (“ought” in the public realm) collapsed. This collapse caused the culture war we’ve been cursed with since, so I devote <a href="#extra15">a full page</a> to it later.</p>
<p>Blurring the self/other distinction also contributed to the collapse of the boundary between psychology and religion (or “spirituality”). Monist religion holds that one’s <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss19" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'True Self', 'gloss19')" title='The “deep" or “true” or “authentic” self is an imaginary, inaccessible superior identity, which has a magical connection with the Cosmic Plan.  “Depth psychology” is particularly big on the true self, but this confused idea has become wide-spread. [Click for details.]'>True Self</a> is the same as God, and the entire universe. Thus, exploration of one’s personal psychology gives direct insight into the most profound metaphysical questions. Monism erased the boundary between sacred and profane matters; nothing was any longer outside the purview of spiritual concern.</p>
<p>Since the personal was now both political and spiritual, the distinction between religion and politics also collapsed. Demands for political change were considered not merely a matter of one social group promoting its material interests against others, but to reflect Ultimate Truth as given by the monist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss20" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss20')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution">sexual revolution↗︎︎</a>” dissolved the sexual boundary of marriage, and eliminated most distinctions between “morally” acceptable and unacceptable sexual acts. The sexual revolution also reflected a collapse of the division between private and public morality. Privately, sexual mores had been loosening for half a century. A considerable gap had opened between what people did in their bedrooms and what they said in public. This was one of the most obvious forms of the 1950s moral hypocrisy that motivated the counterculture. To a significant extent, the sexual revolution merely allowed everyone to acknowledge what many had already been doing.</p>
<p>Feminism broke down boundaries between male and female social, sexual, and family roles.</p>
<p>The nuclear family home—a mainly Victorian middle-class invention—had long been found restrictive and isolating by many. The monist counterculture advocated replacing it with communes, collectives, and intentional communities: social structures that emphasize connections across biological families, and that break down the private/public boundary.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_monist_dualist">How the monist counterculture was dualist</h2>
<p>Monism and dualism <a href="#chap94">contain each other</a>, and each turns into the other near boundaries. Monism—the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss21" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denial', 'gloss21')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense. [Click for details.]">denial</a> of all boundaries—nevertheless draws an absolute boundary <a href="#chap94_monism">between itself and dualism</a>. It rejects dualism as an absolutely unacceptable evil. It seeks to destroy dualism; or, failing that, to purify itself of any dualistic tendencies.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture went out of its way to shock, aggravate, and alienate “squares,” i.e. dualists. The point was to harden the distinction between monists and dualists. As Ken Kesey put it, “Either you are on the bus, or you are off the bus.” “<a href="http://wild-bohemian.com/onthebus.htm">On the bus↗︎︎</a>” came to mean “monist”—and either you rode monism all the way, or you were off the bus and left behind.</p>
<p>Hippies were a tiny subculture in 1964, the year of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_(bus)">the Further bus trip↗︎︎</a>. Requiring intense commitment, and some hostility to outsiders, are necessary for maintaining the integrity of a subculture—as we’ll see later. Kesey’s attitude was sensible then.</p>
<p>Subcultural hippiedom formed the core of the monist counterculture (together with Berkeley student radicalism). As a local subculture of dozens scaled up into a global counterculture of tens of millions, “either you are on or you are off” became the recipe for the culture war that still plagues us.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_dualist_dualist">How the dualist counterculture was dualist</h2>
<p>The dualist counterculture was a mirror image of the monist one: the same shape, with many aspects flipped left-to-right, and others left intact.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_0yg321e" id="extra29_footnoteref1_0yg321e" title="I have researched the history of only the American dualist counterculture. I am not sure whether other Western countries developed anything similar (whereas the American monist counterculture was certainly influential elsewhere). Islamic fundamentalism is also a dualist counterculture, and structurally similar to the American one.">1</a></p>
<p>The creators of the dualist counterculture presented it largely as a reaction to the monist one. In their view, the monist counterculture had wrongly blurred numerous boundaries. Those therefore needed sharpening—the essence of dualism.</p>
<p>As a point-by-point opposition to the monist program, the dualist “<a href="http://reason.com/archives/2007/06/27/the-aquarians-and-the-evangeli/print">counter-counterculture↗︎︎</a>” necessarily took on its opponent’s structure. We could go through all the boundaries I listed above as denied by the monist counterculture, and we’d find that most were fixated by the dualist one. For example, dualists promoted:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>man’s dominion over nature</li>
<li>submission to the Creator</li>
<li>and to legitimate secular authority</li>
<li>nationalism</li>
<li>racial segregation</li>
<li>distinct gender roles</li>
<li>the sanctity of marriage versus the sinfulness of non-marital sex</li>
<li>human rights starting from the instant of conception, not gradually over months</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is familiar territory. I want only to point out that the unifying feature of these positions is that they draw hard boundaries.</p>
<p>The dualist counterculture also claimed to want to restore “traditional values.” It was never clear which era it proposed to return to; <a href="#chap163">in fact</a>, it wanted to “restore” a romanticized, mythical past in which the <a href="#chap151">systematic mode</a> actually worked. But to the extent that the systematic mode did work—in the 1850s or 1950s—it was partly on the basis of dualism. Taking those eras as ideals naturally also led to dualism.</p>
<p>So, for reasons of both reaction and nostalgia, insistence on boundaries is the common feature throughout the explicit “values agenda” of the dualist counterculture.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_dualist_monist">How the dualist counterculture was monist</h2>
<p>Although the Religious Right presented itself as a point-by-point repudiation, it adopted much of the structure, strategy, tactics, and conceptual framework of the monist counterculture.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_ndytbii" id="extra29_footnoteref2_ndytbii" title="I find this borrowing extremely interesting, because it reveals intellectual and emotional commonalities that were deliberately obscured by both countercultures. Although I’m tempted to detail the history here, not everyone is as geeky about such things as I am. If you’d like to learn more, try Countercultural Conservatives, pp. 93-101, 123, 132-6, et passim. Also, Hippies of the Religious Right is apparently entirely about this, but I haven’t read it.">2</a> Several factors forced this similarity:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>It implicitly adopted some monist principles</li>
<li>It deliberately imitated the monist counterculture</li>
<li>Surprisingly many leftist hippies later became Evangelical rightists</li>
<li>Both were responses to the same failures of the systematic mode</li>
<li>Both retained the systematic mode’s commitment to universalism</li>
<li>Both <a href="#chap160">borrowed from 1800s Romanticism</a></li>
<li>Monism and dualism both necessarily turn into the other when pressed</li>
</ul>
<p>As a consequence, the dualist counterculture tacitly accepted and promoted several of the monist counterculture’s erasures of boundaries:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>between the personal/private and the political/public</li>
<li>between ethics, religion, politics, and psychology</li>
<li>between religions and sects</li>
</ul>
<p>The two countercultures were in violent, albeit unstated, agreement on these points. They were also, I believe, disastrously wrong: these boundaries are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss13')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a> but necessary. This shared error explains many of the social, cultural, and psychological problems we face today. I will explain that, bit by bit, throughout “<a href="#chap148">How meaning fell apart</a>.”</p>
<p>Particularly, “<a href="#chap159">Renegotiating self and society</a>” addresses the collapse of the private/public distinction; “<a href="#extra15">The personal is political</a>” the collapse of that boundary; and “<a href="#chap160">Rejecting rationality, reinventing religion, reconfiguring the self</a>” covers the collapse of the distinction between psychology and religion.</p>
<p>The two remaining sections of this page cover the collapse of the boundary between politics and religion, and between ethics and religion, in the dualist counterculture.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_politics_religion">Unifying politics and religion</h3>
<p>The unity of the political right with Evangelical Christianity—and with particular views on sexual morality—now seems obvious, necessary, and eternal. But it was new, sudden, shocking, and deliberately engineered in the mid-1970s. For outsiders, this was (and remains) the main manifestation of the dualist counterculture.</p>
<p>For decades before the 1970s, Evangelicals were socially marginal, apolitical, and divided into innumerable small hostile sects. They had come together in the 1920s in support of Prohibition and against teaching evolution. The 1925 Scopes “monkey trial” made Fundamentalism look ridiculous, and Evangelicals retreated from public life in humiliation. After the Second World War, some re-entered politics—mainly on the left. Difficult as it may be to imagine now, as late as the 1960s, the majority of Evangelicals opposed capitalism, nationalism, and militarism, and supported women’s suffrage and abortion rights. The social activism of leftist Evangelicals in the 1950s-60s began to blur the boundary between ethics, politics, and religion, and was a prototype for the 1970s-80s Religious Right.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_lyr5e8u" id="extra29_footnoteref3_lyr5e8u" title="See Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right for a detailed history.">3</a></p>
<p id="extra29_schaeffers">Evangelicalism’s merger with the political right was primarily authored by Francis and Frank Schaeffer, whose extraordinary story I recount on <a href="#chap158">the next page</a>. Francis was a socially liberal Fundamentalist theologian who led a hippie commune. His teenage son Frank somehow conceived a passionate concern for the rights of the unborn. Abortion had been an exclusively Catholic and mainly left issue; Protestants and Republicans mostly considered it acceptable even up to the time of natural birth.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_14exwk8" id="extra29_footnoteref4_14exwk8" title="For a brief popular discussion, see “When evangelicals were pro-choice.” For an academic treatment, Linda Greenhouse and Reva B. Siegel, “Before (and After) Roe v. Wade,” Yale Law Journal 2028:2011. For context, Countercultural Conservatives and Sex, Mom, and God. From the last, pp. 128-9: “Dr. W. A. Criswell (a two-term president of the Southern Baptist Convention)… was on record saying he didn’t think life began until a baby took his or her first breath.”">4</a></p>
<p>Frank convinced his reluctant<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_49fc90y" id="extra29_footnoteref5_49fc90y" title="“I don’t want to be identified with some Catholic issue.

Their roadshow was unexpectedly, hugely popular, and started to convert Evangelicals to the cause.</p>
<p>Republican Party operatives took note. Although the Party had long supported abortion rights, in 1972 they tried to appeal to Catholics (mainly Democrats) by reversing their position. That failed—but the Schaeffers’ popularity made them realize the same strategy might work on Evangelicals (also majority left). They reached out to the Schaeffers,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_pn4xxyl" id="extra29_footnoteref6_pn4xxyl" title="Billy Zeoli, Gerald Ford’s Whitehouse chaplain, was the first main go-between. Congressman Jack Kemp was an early close ally. Eventually the Schaeffers worked with most of the most powerful Republicans, including Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush.">6</a> and soon cemented a deal of mutual cooptation. The Schaeffers would deliver Evangelical votes to the Party; the Party would make opposition to abortion an ideological centerpiece for the political Right. (Frank Schaeffer later said that their alliance with the Right was essentially an accident, which he came to regret.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_e7ufc5y" id="extra29_footnoteref7_e7ufc5y" title="In his fascinating Crazy For God.">7</a> They could just as easily allied with the Democratic Party, and in fact the Schaeffers’ socially liberal views would have been a better fit there.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority">Moral Majority↗︎︎</a>, the most famous dualist-counterculture institution, was founded on Francis Schaeffer’s advice. Jerry Falwell, its public face, had firmly believed that politics and religion didn’t mix.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_ok3zoyc" id="extra29_footnoteref8_ok3zoyc" title="Quoted from “People &amp; Ideas: Jerry Falwell”; God in America. Also there: “In his famous 1964 sermon, ‘Ministers and Marches,’ Falwell declared, ‘Preachers are not called to be politicians, but soul winners….’ His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke to the political activism of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.” Similarly Billy Graham, who became another major spokesperson for the Religious Right. “Most evangelical leaders, following Billy Graham’s lead, weren’t interested in ‘going political.’ When [Francis Schaeffer] asked Billy why he wasn’t taking a stand on abortion, Billy answered that he had been burned by getting too close to Nixon and was never going to poke his head over the ramparts of the ‘I-only-preach-the-gospel’ trench again. He said he didn’t want to be ‘political.’” Crazy For God, p. 290.">8</a> Schaeffer changed Falwell’s mind—and convinced him to make abortion the Moral Majority’s central issue. Paul Weyrich co-founded the Moral Majority; he provided the political, organizational, and financial backing. His expertise was creating think tanks and lobbying groups that connected money from big business donors with economically conservative political ideology.</p>
<p>The Schaeffer/Weyrich strategy worked astonishingly well. On the religious side, within a few years, fervent commitment to the anti-abortion cause became the single-issue “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/#tribal">badge↗︎︎</a>” of membership in the entire political-religious dualist counterculture.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_anao97d" id="extra29_footnoteref9_anao97d" title="I explained moral badges in “Ethics is advertising.” My discussion there was based on Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior.">9</a> It is not credible that tens of millions of Americans who had zero interest in abortion in 1975 discovered deep concern for the well-being of fetuses by 1980. Instead, public opposition to abortion became the main symbol, or shibboleth, for good standing in a counterculture whose actual appeal lay elsewhere.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_6yqjuog" id="extra29_footnoteref10_6yqjuog" title="Exactly why the abortion strategy worked so well, and the precise appeal of dualist counterculture, remains somewhat mysterious. I have read many plausible partial explanations, but no convincing synthesis. Most authors agree that the desire to make sex more dangerous for people of other socioeconomic classes is central to American “social conservatism.” Research by Jason Weeden and his collaborators suggests American religiosity is based on practical benefits for a many-child reproductive strategy. A key paper is “Religious attendance as reproductive support,” Evolution and Human Behavior 29 (2008) 327–334. His The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won’t Admit It, written for a non-academic audience, lays out implications for electoral politics. I think Weeden’s work is on the right track, but there’s much it still doesn’t explain. For an interesting—albeit inconclusive and unconvincing—meta-discussion, see Bethany Moreton, “Why Is There So Much Sex in Christian Conservatism and Why Do So Few Historians Care Anything about It?,” The Journal of Southern History, Vol. 75, No. 3 (August 2009), pp. 717-738. Winning line: “Sodomites are a traditionally underrepresented market for abortion services.”">10</a></p>
<p>On the political side, the Moral Majority was widely considered responsible for the election of Ronald Reagan as President in 1980.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_uw0jcjn" id="extra29_footnoteref11_uw0jcjn" title="Historians have later questioned whether the Moral Majority’s support actually was critical, or if Reagan would have been elected anyway.

Also Religion and the Culture Wars: Dispatches from the Front, pp. 20ff.">11</a> Reagan ran against the incumbent Democratic President, Jimmy Carter. Carter was the first “born again” President, and had taken the Evangelical vote in 1976. However, despite his personal opposition to abortion, Carter refused to make it a political issue, which Evangelicals saw as a betrayal. Reagan was not personally particularly religious, had been pro-choice only a few years earlier, and did not stress social issues in his campaign. He was primarily an economic conservative and nationalist, and in office delivered almost nothing the Moral Majority wanted. However, by 1980, the Republican Party had become the Evangelical Party, so none of that mattered.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_values">Unifying religion by replacing piety with “moral values”</h3>
<p>Evangelical Christians had long been split among numerous separatist, schismatic sects. Most were intensely hostile to Catholics and Jews, and fought each other over arcane metaphysical distinctions that were largely forgotten by the end of the decade.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_h7j11gp" id="extra29_footnoteref12_h7j11gp" title="Among the most important were diverging dispensationalist millennialisms. I’ve spent many hours trying to figure out what, if anything, this dispute was about, and completely failed. However, it’s charmingly reminiscent of the filioque schism. It’s also entertaining and instructive to compare the Wikipedia article on sectarian millennialisms with its article on heavy metal genres, which display similar fissiparous tendencies. More about that when we get to the evolutionary dynamics of subcultures.">12</a></p>
<p>Francis Schaeffer not only united Evangelicals across sectarian lines, he also created durable alliances between them and conservative Catholics, Mormons, and Jews.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_xkj3xnz" id="extra29_footnoteref13_xkj3xnz" title="This despite his earlier decades in the trenches as a member of a Presbyterian sub-sub-sub-sect fighting holy wars against other Presbyterian sub-sub-sub-sects with infinitesimally different theological views.">13</a> Under Schaeffer’s influence, Falwell—a Southern Baptist—made the Moral Majority ecumenical: Weyrich was Catholic, and its third founder was Howard Phillips, a Jewish Republican politician.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_p1z2shz" id="extra29_footnoteref14_p1z2shz" title="Separatist Fundamentalists denounced the Moral Majority for this inclusiveness.">14</a> Falwell increasingly downplayed his extremist moral positions, including his formerly overt racism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_5smiagk" id="extra29_footnoteref15_5smiagk" title="For decades, his main moral cause had been support for racial segregation, but by the late ’70s that was no longer respectable. The Moral Majority did make opposition to the Supreme Court’s Bob Jones University anti-segregation decision its second-most-important cause, notionally on religious freedom grounds. Ironically, the ungrateful University declared the Moral Majority “Satanic,” “holding that it was a step toward the apostate one-world church and government body as it would cross the line from a political alliance to a religious one between true Christians and the non-born-again, as forbidden by their interpretation of the Bible.” (Quote from the Wikipedia article on Jerry Falwell.)">15</a></p>
<p>Forging a mass movement required dropping most of the traditional religious content of Evangelicalism—because that was extreme, incomprehensible, and unacceptable to nearly everyone. And anyway, no two Evangelical theologians could agree on it!</p>
<p>The new dualist counterculture replaced traditional doctrine and piety with “values” and “experiences.” It was easy to get broad agreement on those. I’ll discuss the new Christian “experiences” in “<a href="#chap160">Rejecting rationality, reinventing religion, reconfiguring the self</a>”; and “values” here.</p>
<p>Substituting “values” for traditional Christianity was the culmination of a process that had been underway for most of a century. By the late 1800s, it was obvious that much of what the Bible said was wrong. Mainline Protestants adopted a liberal, modernist theology according to which the important thing about Christianity was its humanistic ethical teachings, not its metaphysical beliefs. Fundamentalism, in reaction, insisted that everything in the Bible was literally true. In the 1920s, internal conflict between modernists and fundamentalists split most American Protestant sects.</p>
<p>The religious leaders of the dualist counterculture were Fundamentalists. A few decades earlier, they had taught not only Biblical inerrancy, but also an ascetic moral code that forbade smoking, drinking, dancing, watching movies or plays, listening to secular music, and all “worldly pursuits” (including politics). These sins all lead straight to damnation and eternal hellfire! This was a non-starter for a 1970s mass movement.</p>
<p>In the counterculture, it was adequate to <em>say</em> you believed everything in the Bible, even if you had little idea what was in there, and in practice disagreed with much of it. The main thing was “believing” in Jesus as your personal savior.</p>
<p>It was also adequate to “have values,” rather than conforming to a moral code.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_u6nc0pd" id="extra29_footnoteref16_u6nc0pd" title="I suspect this was because by the 1970s, everyone from secular humanists to Fundamentalists was in nearly complete agreement on what acts are moral or immoral. An earlier chapter discusses this in terms of “ethical ease” and “ethical agreement”; morality was a solved problem.">16</a> “Values” were opinions about things other people did. The most important values were condemning abortion and “the homosexual lifestyle.” (Both were non-traditional: homosexuality was not a significant issue before the 1970s; and, as I mentioned, Evangelicals had mostly considered abortion acceptable.)</p>
<p>The “values” innovation effectively replicated the Christian Modernist move of replacing religious piety with ethics, but went a step further: opinions replaced both belief and morality. “Having” an opinion means stating it forcefully, or assenting to it, when ritually required. It does not necessarily involve belief, in the ordinary sense that you believe your car needs a wash. You must “believe” in Creation Science rather than evolution—but since it has no consequence for your everyday life, this is often no more than performing a public tribal loyalty oath.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_4a2sdsd" id="extra29_footnoteref17_4a2sdsd" title="I’m not suggesting Fundamentalists secretly disbelieve what they assert in public, only that belief in the ordinary sense does not enter into it.">17</a></p>
<p>I’m not taking sides here; this was equally true of the monist counterculture, in which you were also required to “believe” endless absurdities—that is, to <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/">agree to them in public↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_reading">Further reading</h2>
<p>I started this page by recounting my “peculiar realization” that the Moral Majority was structurally and functionally similar to the hippie counterculture it opposed. It took a year to convince myself that this was accurate and significant. At first it seemed probably mistaken; then likely an accidental and superficial resemblance. But eventually, I decided it was an exciting and remarkably clever discovery.</p>
<p>Turns out, it’s old hat. In subsequent reading, I found that many historians, and even some members of the movement, have pointed out the countercultural nature of the 1980s Religious Right. They have traced many structural parallels and historical connections between the two countercultures.</p>
<p>Describing the two countercultures in terms of monism and dualism <em>does</em> seem to be new. These categories are important in metaphysics, but have mostly not been applied to culture, ethics, or politics before.</p>
<p>The two best overview articles I’ve found on the web analyze the similarity between the two countercultures from a libertarian, subcultural point of view:</p>

<li>Jesse Walker’s “<a href="http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/print.aspx?article=31&amp;loc=b&amp;type=cbbp">The Traditionalist Counterculture↗︎︎</a>,” which is a review of Rod Dreher’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DYGO7S/?tag=meaningness-20">Crunchy Cons: The New Conservative Counterculture and Its Return to Roots↗︎︎</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Libertarians, and most Gen X subculturalists, stand outside the usual framing of the culture war. They are perhaps better able to regard both sides dispassionately, and to see their commonalities, rather than identifying with one against the other.</p>
<p>In writing this page, I made heavy use of Axel R. Schäfer’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AM1RIQ6/?tag=meaningness-20">Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right↗︎︎</a>, an academic history.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_fmk8rqz" id="extra29_footnoteref18_fmk8rqz" title="Schäfer is not related to Francis Schaeffer, as far as I know.">18</a></p>
<p>Ross Douthat’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/143917833X/?tag=meaningness-20">Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics↗︎︎</a> is an excellent history of the transformation of American Christianity during the countercultural era.</p>

<p class="intro_para">
The <a href="#chap153">failure</a> of social and psychological <a href="#chap151">systems</a> propelled the 1960s-80s <a href="#chap155">countercultures</a>. Societies had required selves to conform to modern, unnatural systems of employment, government, and religion. These arrangements were invented and imposed with little regard for individuals or local communities.</p>
<p>They were founded on economic, political, and theological theories that were mainly abstract and rationalistic. They ignored innate human needs, desires, and proclivities. It’s a wonder they worked for as long as they did.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>These obsolete modern ideologies included, for example, Taylorism, the Westphalian nation-state, and the Victorian family.</p>
<ul>
<li><dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management">Scientific Taylorism↗︎︎</a></dfn> was the dominant theory of industrial management. It explicitly treated workers as machines whose performance should be optimized with intensive management controls.</li>
<li>A state is legitimate, according to the modern <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty">Westphalian↗︎︎</a></dfn> international system, if it rules a nation. A “nation” is defined as a set of people who share a single culture and social system. Rulers, therefore, did their best to force uniform systems on as many people as possible. This typically involved destroying most social traditions and institutions intermediate in scope between the nuclear family and the state.</li>
<li>The ideology of <dfn>the traditional family</dfn> developed <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/sex-and-sexuality-19th-century/">in the 1800s↗︎︎</a>, and in that century was mainly restricted to English-speaking middle class Protestants. (So it was not traditional for the working class, or for many American immigrants.) Its precisely-defined gender and parent/child roles, emphasis on a sharp division between the nuclear family and outside world, and strict life-long monogamy are historically unusual. They don’t function well for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="#chap153_self">crisis of the self</a> showed that organizing one’s psychology to systematic requirements, with <a href="#chap151_self">a hard public/private boundary</a>, was unworkable for many people. The fragmentation and isolation of communities and individuals was intolerable. After spending the 1950s whistling past the graveyard of systematicity, renegotiating the relationship between self and society became obviously urgent in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>The previous half-century <a href="#chap153_responses">had developed</a> two alternatives, <a href="#chap153_totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> and <a href="#chap153_existentialism">existentialism</a>, which were pathological extremes of collectivism and individualism.

I discuss two countercultures in depth, the monist “hippie” counterculture of the 1960s-70s, and the “Moral Majority” counterculture of the 1970s-80s. Both failed because neither’s vision appealed to a majority, and they could not accommodate diversity, due to their universalism. [Click for details.]">countercultures</a> attempted new, less absolutist renegotiations of the self/society relationship, which blurred the hard line between the two. However, both countercultures also drew on both totalitarianism and existentialism, and affirmed the values of both individualism and collectivism in ways that were incoherent and still extreme. This tended to heighten the self/society conflict, even while attempting to defuse it.</p>
<p>The countercultures <a href="#chap166">failed because</a> they retained systematic constraints—especially, <dfn>universalism</dfn>. They assumed that there <a href="#chap51">must be</a> <em>one right</em> way for individuals to be, and <em>one right</em> model for society, and the two must fit together harmoniously.

<p><a href="#chap157">Both countercultures</a> wrestled with the self/society conflict at both ends: at the self end through psychology and religion, and at the society end through “values-based” political action.</p>
<p>On the whole, the monist (“hippie”) counterculture wanted to reform the public sphere to better match private proclivities; the dualist (“Moral Majority”) counterculture wanted to reform private souls to better match public morality. So the monist counterculture was more influenced by existentialism, and the dualist one by totalitarianism, although both drew on both (as we shall see).</p>
<p>In both countercultures, some activists argued that individual spiritual transformation was a prerequisite to social change, and others argued that social reform was a necessary support to constructing better selves. Despite internal conflict between these wings, both movements adopted the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Romantic', 'gloss1')" title="Romanticism—in this book—is the view that the True Self is mystically connected with The Entire Universe. The &quot;True Self&quot; is spiritual and emotional and intuitive, so Romanticism is anti-rational. Romanticism is closely related with monism, since it imagines connections that do not actually exist. Unlike monism, however, Romanticism does not deny all differences. Historically, it was primarily an aesthetic movement, based on the idea that ultimate reality expressed itself through the artist's True Self based on their special connection. [Click for details.]">Romantic</a> idea that personal change can quasi-magically fix society by the propagation of good vibrations. Both also adopted the Romantic idea that if only society were properly organized, everyone would live together in happy harmony.</p>
<p>The next two pages, “<a href="#chap160">Rejecting rationality, reinventing religion, reconfiguring the self</a>” and “<a href="#extra15">The personal is political</a>,” describe both countercultures’ reform efforts at these two ends. Inevitably, they overlap to some extent, because both movements’ program was to merge them.</p>
<p>The remainder of this page is an overview of these programs, in terms of particular problems in the self/society interface and their attempted solutions. Some worked reasonably well, and were adopted as stable policy by governments; others were harmful or just obviously impractical. I will sketch the vicissitudes of these innovations in later modes: <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultural', 'gloss2')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

<h3 id="extra29_overall">Overall strategy</h3>
<p>Overall, both countercultures sought to replace the artificial, seemingly-arbitrary social and personal requirements of the systematic mode with ones they considered natural. Unfortunately, their ideas about what would be natural were, in both cases, completely crazy. (In my opinion; but also this was widely acknowledged once the countercultural era ended.) Because both countercultures were <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalist</a>, they took their insane ideologies as absolute and universal, and so tended toward harmful totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Replacing artificial systematic requirements with natural ones remains a popular goal. It’s a decent impulse, but unfortunately there is currently no alternative to artificial social systems capable of supporting a global population of billions. The future, fluid mode must find ways to <em>simulate</em> natural (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'choiceless', 'gloss6')" title="In the choiceless mode, you are unaware of differences of opinion concerning meaningness. You take meanings for granted, without asking “why” questions. It could also be called the communal mode or “tradition.” [Click for details.]">choiceless</a>) roles while keeping artificial systems running—at least until we develop some other alternative.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, both countercultures tried to blur the public/private boundary as a way of addressing alienation and isolation. This was a step in the right direction, but I will suggest that one reason the countercultures failed is that they offered no <em>structural</em> change in the self/society relationship. The development of <dfn>subsocieties</dfn>—structures intermediate in scale between family and state—was a major contribution of the subcultural mode.</p>
<p>Both countercultures considered rationality and objectivity the source of modern meaninglessness, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss7')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related.

Both rejected rationality, embraced subjectivism, and tried to evert subjective meanings to re-enchant the world; to restore its inherent sacred meaning. This was extremely harmful, I think. I hope the fluid mode can recognize meaning as real but <a href="#chap110">neither objective nor subjective</a>; and rationality as a valuable tool, but not an <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss8')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.

<h3 id="extra29_self">Technologies of the self</h3>
<p>Acting according to formal roles, as demanded by systematic societies, is unnatural. If you <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">develop a systematic self↗︎︎</a>, it can be comfortable and empowering, but <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#empirical">for most people↗︎︎</a> formal roles feel alienating. Why should artificial, systematic demands take precedence over your personal feelings and your relationships? Your public self feels false: mere play-acting of an arbitrary, often humiliating or incomprehensible script.</p>
<p>Both countercultures adopted the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Romantic', 'gloss1')" title="Romanticism—in this book—is the view that the True Self is mystically connected with The Entire Universe.

[Click for details.]'>true self</a>. That is an idealization of the private self, freed from arbitrary public conventions. Not the private self <em>as it is</em>, because that is neurotic and sinful and false, but the self reformed and perfected. You should find your true self, and then you should be true to it. You should speak and act from that self, regardless of social judgement, because it would comport naturally with the <em>correct</em> social organization. This is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/04/04/ritual-vs-mentalism/">“sincerity” and “authenticity”↗︎︎</a>—key values of both countercultures.</p>
<p>There is no true self, so this approach was mainly harmful. The atomized mode effectively abandoned “authenticity,” because it is obviously impossible to be “true” to an <a href="/atomized-self">atomized self↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Modern employment is dehumanizing. (Deliberately so, under Taylorism.) The countercultures developed personal and small-group practices for personal emotional fulfillment, self expression, and “finding yourself.” These seem to me on the right track, but had limited success, mainly due to universalism—the denial of diversity. The subcultures made their greatest contribution here: expressive communal practices for “DIY” exploration of psychologies, aesthetic culture, and social models.</p>
<p>In complex, modern societies, most people have <em>multiple</em> formal roles, in additional to natural (biological) ones. The contrasts between roles cause internal fragmentation; you internalize external ways of being as “multiple selves.” Conflicts among them are disruptive and painful in both the <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">communal↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">systematic↗︎︎</a> modes, which expect internal coherence.</p>
<p>The countercultures promised new technologies for re-unifying the self. These didn’t work. The subcultural mode began to develop ways of managing a fragmented self; for reconciling and switching among selves. The fluid mode finds internal diversity comfortable and empowering.</p>
<p>Many counterculturalists tried to make membership in one of the countercultures the unifying theme of their identity. They considered themselves first and foremost conservative Christians or liberal New Agers; and only after that insurance claims managers, Iowans, or softball players. Their community was not their town, church, or company, but the brotherhood of all participants in their counterculture. This resonated with universalism: both countercultures treated all their members as equivalent. Countercultural identity didn’t work well, because a nation-scaled group is too large a group to provide functional community; and because each counterculture merely suppressed and denied its internal diversity.</p>
<p>Ecstatic experience is the <a href="#chap153_ecstasy">natural antidote</a> to rigid social requirements. That was banned in the systematic era. Modernized, rationalized Christianity had mostly also eliminated experience of the sacred and transcendent, emphasizing this-worldly humanistic ethics. Both countercultures produced new religions and quasi-religions emphasizing ecstatic practices, “direct experience,” and the supernatural. I think this was an important step forward, although the details were mostly wrong.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_social">Social reform</h3>
<p>Both countercultures tried to reorient society away from formal, systematic roles toward natural ones: family, unstructured friendships, and local communities. This was the obvious response to the painful gap between the private and public selves. However, it represents a partial reversion toward the choiceless mode, which isn’t capable of sustaining contemporary civilization. That could eventually become disastrous.</p>
<p>Both countercultures sought to revise systematic social norms to make them more natural. The monist counterculture thought humanistic, egalitarian norms would be more natural. The dualist counterculture thought godly, hierarchical norms would be more natural. This divergence led to the destructive and unwinnable <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>.</p>
<p>In the face of mid-century anomie—the breakdown in public morality—both countercultures tried to strengthen social norms as well as revising them. Their reforms emphasized “ethics” and “values,” which fused with, or even replaced, politics. Notoriously, the two countercultures disagreed violently about military and reproductive “values,” which also fed the culture war.</p>
<p>“Family values” were—and are—the central culture war issue, actually. Both countercultures agreed that “traditional” families weren’t working as they should. The monist response was to dissolve or replace the model; the dualist counterculture tried to strengthen, support, and universalize it. During the subcultural era, American society reluctantly accepted a compromise allowing diverse sexual and family models, but upholding the “traditional” one as ideal.</p>
<p>Both countercultures recognized the value of local communities, which the systematic mode had eroded. Both invented new local community models: monist communes and dualist megachurches. Communes failed quickly; megachurches remain vigorous. The subcultural mode developed <dfn>subsocieties</dfn> as another new model for community, which unfortunately did not survive atomization. The atomized mode provides virtual but limited community through internet social networks. Overall, the problem of community is still mainly unsolved.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In the systematic mode, you create a rational, <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">systematic self↗︎︎</a>. A systematic self has a clear boundary, so it is not flooded by the emotions and expectations of others. You act as the administrator of an internal world of principles, projects, and formal roles. A systematic self is far more sophisticated than a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'choiceless', 'gloss0')" title="In the choiceless mode, you are unaware of differences of opinion concerning meaningness. You take meanings for granted, without asking “why” questions. It could also be called the communal mode or “tradition.” [Click for details.]">choiceless</a> one, and is a prerequisite to participating effectively in a systematic society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this sort of self is unnatural. Living as one sometimes exposes contradictions between systematicity and human nature. It can give the feeling of being a tiny cog in a vast, uncaring, meaningless machine—the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_cage">Iron Cage↗︎︎</a>” of rationalized bureaucracy. When a society imposes systematicity rigidly, it <a href="#chap153_self">becomes psychologically intolerable</a> for many people.</p>
<p>The countercultures <a href="#chap159">demanded to renegotiate</a> the relationship between self and society. Both began by rejecting rationality, and the systematic principles, projects, and formal roles that rationality justified.</p>
<p>I <a href="#chap156">defined countercultures</a> as “new, alternative, universalist, eternalist, anti-rational systems.” The only distinctive part of this was the anti-rationalism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_x7ht0qh" id="extra29_footnoteref1_x7ht0qh" title="This wasn’t actually new. Both countercultures drew heavily on Romanticism, a major cultural movement of the 1800s, as a source of anti-rational ideas, inspirations, practices, and programs. I discuss this at length in “Countercultures: modern mythologies.”">1</a> “New, alternative, universalist, eternalist, <em>rational</em> systems” had been tried repeatedly during the systematic era.

Both countercultures did borrow heavily from both Freudianism and existentialism—the monist one overtly, the dualist one covertly.">2</a></p>

Having abandoned rationality, both countercultures turned to religion as a foundation for eternalism. Mainstream Christianity had been rationalized in the 1800s, so the countercultures constructed alternatives: the New Age in the monist one, and a reworked Evangelical Christianity in the dualist one.</p>
<p>The countercultural religions developed ecstatic, quasi-magical, anti-rational technologies of self-transformation. These aimed to remake the self to strengthen it against the depredations of systematic society and—particularly in the dualist counterculture—to adapt it to better conform to systematic demands. They also promised emotional, social, and pragmatic this-world benefits, whereas traditional religion emphasized self-denial, devotion to God, and other-world salvation.</p>
<p>The two countercultures tried to solve many of the same problems, drawing from the same limited set of pre-existing cultural tools. Superficially opposed, they attempted many similar solutions. I find these similarities remarkable, but the point of this page is not to draw the interesting historical parallels. Rather: we mostly still have these same problems—although subsequent <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'modes of meaningness', 'gloss3')" title="“How meaning fell apart” suggests a series of modes of relating to meaningness. In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.) As systematic justifications break down, the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes are successive attempts to relate to the fragmentation of meaning. Finally, the fluid mode synthesizes the functional aspects of all the previous ones. [Click for details.]">modes of meaningness</a> have contributed some additional tools toward solving them. Understanding the countercultures’ attempts, and how they failed, may help us now.</p>
<p>Overall, anti-rationalism was a disaster, I think. The self/society relationship <em>did</em> need extensive renegotiation—and still does. However, we can no longer live without rational social systems, and we are <a href="#extra12">diminished as human beings</a> if we lose the ability to create rational selves. The countercultures picked the wrong target, and the alternative, anti-rational systems they built were profoundly dysfunctional. When <a href="#chap166">their failure</a> became obvious, the modern world ended. We live in <a href="#chap167">the wreckage</a>, called “postmodernity.”</p>
<p>All is not lost.

<p>Rationality ruins everything. As you know. As everyone has known for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Back in the <a href="#chap150">choiceless mode</a>, all things were charged with inherent meaning, mountains were inhabited by benevolent and terrifying gods, and you always knew what you were supposed to do. Then rationality came along and pointed out that meanings can’t be objective, there are no spooks, and you can’t derive <i>ought</i> from <i>is</i>. And the world was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disenchantment">disenchanted↗︎︎</a>, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss7')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

<p>But wait! The heroic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism">Romantics↗︎︎</a>, on their magnificent steeds of poetry, mounted the counter-charge, plumes flying from their noble helms, against the machine guns of materialism. Meaning, they cried, was subjective, revealed by emotion, intuition, and aesthetic appreciation.

<p>Alas, in mundane modernity, superior firepower defeats valor. The existentialists, seemingly the last ragged company of Romantics, fell, ignobly, in the late 1950s. Rationality demonstrated that meaning cannot be subjective <em>either</em>; Romanticism inevitably collapses into mere <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss10')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rationality had turned its guns inward. During the first half of the century, <a href="#chap154">rational certainty destroyed itself</a>—in philosophy, mathematics, and science. Not only had it obliterated all other sources of meaning, rationality finally demonstrated its own meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Then what? asked the founders of the countercultures, in the 1960s. Rationality had been exhausted. All possible rational bases for systems had been tried, and <a href="#chap153">had failed</a>. Also, scientific rationality was apparently to blame for all the Twentieth Century horrors: the World Wars, loss of Christian faith, rampant materialism, ecological devastation, abortion, and nuclear weapons. Anyway, meaning <a href="#chap25">obviously does exist</a>, so if rationality says it’s neither objective nor subjective, it must just be wrong.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_reinventing">Reinventing religion: anti-rationalism as the cure</h2>
<p>Well, this is easy! Reject rationality, and recover meaning from its most salient source: religion. (In fact, rational analysis shows that eternalism is wrong. If eternalism is misunderstood as the only defense of meaning, any serious attempt to rescue it <em>must</em> reject rationality.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mainline Protestantism—America’s dominant religion—could not do the job. It had been modernized, remade for compatibility with the dictates of rationality, and thereby drained of most of its meaning. The 1920s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist-Modernist_Controversy">fundamentalist vs. modernist↗︎︎</a> war was about this; the fundamentalists lost then. But they were right, in some sense. The modernists were on a slippery slope to secularism, and Mainline Protestantism became a hollow shell of hypocrisy, <a href="#chap43">pretense</a>, and going through the motions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1950s, religious commitment, despite its high levels, was superficial and largely a matter of vogue rather than conviction. Most self-proclaimed believers had little knowledge of the teachings of the Bible. To be a member of a mainline church was more a matter of adhering to convention born of the desire for social belonging. Churches were functioning mainly as social and civic clubs.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_xfzyjrk" id="extra29_footnoteref3_xfzyjrk" title="Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right, p. 36, lightly paraphrased.">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So both countercultures constructed new, anti-rational religious movements to provide the meaningfulness Christianity had lost. The monist counterculture rejected Christianity in favor of “Eastern religion” and New Age nonsense. (Both these were mostly <a href="#extra1">vintage-1800 German Romantic Idealism</a> in disguise.) The dualist counterculture replaced rationalized mainline Christianity with anti-rational fundamentalist, charismatic, and dispensationalist alternatives.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_a88joma" id="extra29_footnoteref4_a88joma" title="Ross Douthat’s Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics is a useful history of American Christian anti-rationalism in the past few decades. He writes from a center-right perspective, and takes the Christianity of the 1950s, rather than the 1970-80s, as his inspirational model.">4</a></p>
<p>All these new religions promoted wacky mythologies: reincarnated space-faring priests from Atlantis bearing monist mystical wisdom; or the dispensationalist Tribulation and Rapture that separate the sheep from the goats. Such myths are defiant statements of anti-rationalism, putting you unambiguously outside the pale of the mainstream systematic worldview. Once you have publicly asserted your belief in holistic chakra rebalancing therapy, or young earth creationism, you are fully committed to simply ignoring everything rationality says. These “beliefs” are shibboleths that demonstrate your allegiance to the countercultural tribe, and rejection of the previous, systematic mode.</p>
<p>In this page’s analysis, what matters in the new religions is not their “beliefs,” but their practices.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_i5ch4su" id="extra29_footnoteref5_i5ch4su" title="I’ll return to the “beliefs” in “Countercultures: modern mythologies”—not to debunk them, but to investigate meta-myths about the origins of the myths themselves.">5</a> In particular, this page looks at the goals of those practices, which was to re-form the self, and to cure the body by curing the spirit. The efficacy of these quasi-magical technologies of personal transformation and faith healing was dubious. Having already committed to believing nonsense made it easier to go along with new absurdities.</p>
<p>Although the myths were untrue, they were at least partly <em>functional</em> in keeping new versions of systematic eternalism going. Despite anti-rationalism, the overall structure of justification was left largely intact in the countercultural mode. The countercultures were still more-or-less coherent systems, and still mostly <em>made sense</em>. As systematic reform movements, they retained legacy “becauses,” left over from systematic mode at its peak, and added new ones. However, there were now also unapologetic gaps that no one felt a need to fill, other than with emotional fantasies.</p>
<p>(Three decades later, in the <a href="#chap173">atomized mode</a>, structure finally disintegrated, coherence was lost, and nothing made sense other than in an emotional, associative way.)</p>
<h2 id="extra29_subjective">The subjective turn and the end of “organized religion”</h2>
<p>External, systematic duties are central to traditional religion. For 1920s fundamentalists, religious practice meant sitting on a hard bench, listening to sermons on ascetic morality, sin, and damnation. By the 1970s, nobody wanted that anymore.</p>
<p>The countercultures’ new religious movements were all about <em>me</em>. They took a “subjective turn,” toward internal personal mental states, particularly non-rational ones such as emotions and “experiences.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_9dnyrzw" id="extra29_footnoteref6_9dnyrzw" title="The term “subjective turn” comes from Charles Taylor’s A Secular Age. There’s an excellent brief discussion in The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion is Giving Way to Spirituality pp. 2-5; you can read it via Amazon’s “Look Inside” feature.">6</a> This was explicit in the monist counterculture; probably that is so widely known that I need not detail it here. On the dualist side, some Christian leaders resisted the subjective turn, but many adopted it covertly, and overall the Christian Right mostly succumbed in time. This is less well-known, so I’ll sketch some main aspects.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_9ic4e7s" id="extra29_footnoteref7_9ic4e7s" title="See Countercultural Conservatives, p. 28: “The personalization of the religious message in evangelicalism constituted a shift from a concern with the proclamation of an objective and universal truth to a concern with the subjective applicability of truth, and thus embodied an alignment to the normative codes of modern pluralism… The emphasis on the individual in popular evangelicalism had its origin in the existentialist focus on subjectivity and the heroic rebel.”">7</a></p>
<p>The subjective turn accelerated centuries-old trends: Protestant interiority, Enlightenment individualism, and Romantic emotionalism. Especially the last: the countercultures developed a renewed Romanticism, which simply ignored rationality instead of fighting it. (I will trace the historical roots of both countercultures in Romanticism <a href="#chap163">later</a>.)</p>
<p>The religions of both countercultures downplayed objective, external moral criteria. They replaced rules and judgements with a view of ethics as flowing from the individual conscience, “being authentic to your true Self,” subjective feelings of compassion, and “doing what feels right in your heart.” And so: “Phrased in the language of psychology, sinfulness was discussed in terms of therapeutic maladjustment, rather than as the transgression of divine commands.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_2tyc473" id="extra29_footnoteref8_2tyc473" title="Countercultural Conservatives, p. 102. See also Smith and Denton’s Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers: “A significant part of Christianity in the United States is actually only tenuously Christian in any sense that is seriously connected to the actual historical Christian tradition, but has rather substantially morphed into Christianity’s misbegotten stepcousin, Christian Moralistic Therapeutic Deism.”">8</a></p>
<p>Countercultural Christianity retained some of the rhetoric of moral absolutism from its 1920s Fundamentalist roots. This seems to have been a major aspect of its appeal. There was much talk about Biblical inerrancy, and the Bible as the source of morals; but, for the most part, the counterculture was morally undemanding in practice.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_0jzuobr" id="extra29_footnoteref9_0jzuobr" title="It is remarkable how willing the movement was to find ethical excuses for its leaders when they were caught snorting cocaine with underage male prostitutes. Such Christian forgiveness was also generally extended to the flock—so long as they publicly swore renewed allegiance to “traditional moral values” afterward. Bad Religion, p. 239, “Evangelical teenagers are more likely to have sex at an early age; Evangelical mothers are more likely to bear children outside marriage; Evangelical marriages are more likely to end in divorce. Catholics have more abortions than the national average.” And, p. 228: “The sense of harmony, unity, and communion that so many mystics experience can provoke a somewhat blasé attitude toward sin and wickedness, and a dismissive attitude toward ordinary moral duties.” See also Cultural Conservatives, p. 146: “While the Christian Right’s insistence on biblical absolutes reinforced its image as the defender of the true faith, it … produced less an assertion of traditional Biblicism than its reduction to generic moral exhortations.”">9</a> It placed an extraordinary, almost exclusive emphasis on sexual morality; and particularly condemned sexual transgressions of sorts that its adherents were unlikely to be tempted to.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_emkqprr" id="extra29_footnoteref10_emkqprr" title="See Weeden, Cohen, and Kendrick’s “Religious attendance as reproductive support” for much useful insight here. The central emphasis on specifically sexual sin was new as of the 1970s, not traditional. It’s notable also that the Biblical basis for opposition to abortion—the #1 moral teaching of the dualist counterculture—is somewhere between extremely scant and non-existent. “Pro-life” and “pro-choice” Christians both claim that a handful of Bible passages support their positions; but all of them, on both sides, seem obscure, oblique, desultory, and dubious. We need to look elsewhere for an explanation for anti-abortion sentiment.">10</a> This enabled enjoyably self-righteous judgement of Those Horrible People In The Other Tribe (monist counterculturalists).</p>
<p>More generally, the specifics of traditional religion were unappealing, and so they were simply dropped. (This, at the same time the Christian Right was marketing itself as the guardian of tradition.) Subjective individualism was incompatible with Christian doctrine. Most supposed Christians were mainly ignorant of the basic tenets of their religion, and would reject them if they knew about them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_gyhrf3h" id="extra29_footnoteref11_gyhrf3h" title="E.g.: “The great majority of active Baby Boom Presbyterians subscribe to neither the traditional Presbyterian standards contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism, nor to any of the more contemporary theological formulations espoused by their church.” Bad Religion, p. 77. “Eight in ten Americans say they are Christians, only four in ten know that Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount, and only half could name the four gospels.” Countercultural Conservatives, p. 33, calling this a “cycle of biblical illiteracy.”">11</a> So doctrine and liturgy were downplayed, with only a few key points retained.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_gz95tpd" id="extra29_footnoteref12_gz95tpd" title="See Countercultural Conservatives pp. 28-33 and 124-5 for further discussion of the themes of this paragraph.">12</a></p>
<p>Subjective individualism was also incompatible with hierarchical authority and institutional traditions, so those disintegrated.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_ocg2p1k" id="extra29_footnoteref13_ocg2p1k" title="“The era witnessed an extraordinary weakening of organized Christianity in the United States and a fundamental shift in America’s spiritual ecology—away from institutional religion and toward a more do-it-yourself and consumer-oriented spirituality—that endures to the present day.” Bad Religion, p. 62.">13</a> This was consonant with the American individualism and Protestant anti-clericalism that had allowed for sectarian innovation for centuries. However, the countercultural era took it to new extremes: a “choose-your-own-Jesus mentality” or “cafeteria Christianity.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_mwg2tdd" id="extra29_footnoteref14_mwg2tdd" title="Bad Religion, pp. 178, 181.">14</a></p>
<p>The innumerable Protestant sects had mainly defined their differences in terms of arcane details of abstract theology. Once everyone stopped preaching that stuff, the boundaries collapsed.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_ep2w1ww" id="extra29_footnoteref15_ep2w1ww" title="This was taken to Perennialist extremes by the monist counterculture, which considered all religions interchangeable. It blithely mixed bits of Aztec myths, Daoism, and Sufism—as representative “wisdom traditions”—in a single sentence.">15</a> Everyone hates “organized religion”, so countercultural Christianity developed a new social mode, featuring non-denominational churches; decentralized, unstructured communities; and ecumenical parachurch organizations whose lines of authority mimicked secular NGOs rather than traditional religious hierarchy. These achieved unprecedented economy of scale by appealing to Evangelical Christians regardless of sectarian affiliation. Generally, too, they gave people what they wanted, rather than demanding of people what traditional religion required.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_self">Re-enchanting the self</h2>
<p>Both countercultures saw the misery of modern life as due partly to inadequate selves. Both used religion as a therapeutic tool for re-forming the self to better cope. Both promoted personal transformation through magical, anti-rational, and supernatural methods. Both promised ecstatic personal fulfillment through direct experience of the divine. Both promised substantial material benefits, to be delivered after the self was properly restructured.</p>
<p>Both promised a better self, featuring self-actualization, self-affirmation, self-awareness, self-compassion, self-confidence, self-definition, self-discovery, self-esteem, self-expression, self-fulfillment, self-help, self-purification, self-realization, self-revelation, and self-transcendence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evangelicalism aligned Christian faith with the Holy Grail of the affluent society: self-realization. Unlike the classic bourgeois Protestantism of the 19th century, whose moral teachings emphasized avoidance of worldly temptation, the revitalized version promised empowerment, joy, and personal fulfillment. A godly life was once understood as grim defiance of sinful urges; now it was the key to untold blessings.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_nwahdhj" id="extra29_footnoteref16_nwahdhj" title="Brink Lindsey, “The Aquarians and the Evangelicals,” Reason, Jun. 27, 2007.">16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of the difficulty of conforming to an objective moral code, the countercultures sought to instill subjective compassion (for one’s own tribe, at least): an ethics of emotionalism. A moral person was now a happy, self-aware, psychologically well-adjusted one.</p>
<p>The Puritan virtues, required to conform to harsh external norms, were quietly dropped: self-abnegation, self-denial, self-discipline, self-doubt, self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and self-surrender.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ecstasy">Promises of unity, authenticity, and ecstasy</h2>
<p>The modern contrast between the systematic/public and communal/private worlds produced fractured selves, because you had to be different people in different contexts. Both countercultures sought to dissolve the public/private boundary, and to heal the divided self. In fact, they promised that the self could be unified altogether, replacing the broken ego with the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'True Self', 'gloss11')" title='The “deep" or “true” or “authentic” self is an imaginary, inaccessible superior identity, which has a magical connection with the Cosmic Plan.  “Depth psychology” is particularly big on the true self, but this confused idea has become wide-spread. [Click for details.]'>True Self</a>. That might unify even further: with the divine.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_f5r0k6n" id="extra29_footnoteref17_f5r0k6n" title="Kramer and Alstad’s The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power, p. 167ff, analyzes fundamentalism as a response to the divided self. It’s motivated by fear of internal anarchy; that without external restraint, you couldn’t maintain control over evil parts of yourself, which would run amok. Fundamentalism makes this pattern worse, by reinforcing ideas of internal evil and undercutting self-trust. However, surrender to it actually does (temporarily) end internal conflicts by tipping the internal power balance in favor of one part of the self against all others. This frees up a lot of energy, and in a social context creates powerful bonds with people who have made the same move.">17</a></p>
<p>This required supernatural technologies—which the countercultures promised to supply.</p>
<p>Where the systematic mainstream culture required hypocrisy, the countercultures promised authenticity. Where the systematic economy imposed brutal regimentation, the countercultures promised to restore spontaneity and freedom. Finding the authentic, spontaneous True Self was a major project,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_7z38szt" id="extra29_footnoteref18_7z38szt" title="Not least because it doesn’t exist. The subcultural mode made a major advance in abandoning the quest for the unified True Self, and beginning to develop realistic methods for living successfully with a fragmented self.">18</a> for which both countercultures offered magical tools.</p>
<p>In the face of the disenchantment of the world, and loss of religious <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, the countercultures promoted ecstatic personal experience of the sacred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epistemologically, evangelical revivalism, with its reliance on the immediacy of the divine, faith in intuitive knowledge, pursuit of self-purification and holy living, and desire for a profound personal conversion experience, resembled closely the spiritual aspirations of the sixties movements. Rooted in transcendentalist and romantic conceptions of knowledge, countercultural thinking regarded truth as the result of intense, unmediated, and pre-rational experiences that dissolved the rationally constructed dualism of subject and object and revealed the unity behind fragmented existence.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote19_yc405bt" id="extra29_footnoteref19_yc405bt" title="Countercultural Conservatives, p. 94. See further discussion there, p. 95 et passim.">19</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both countercultures developed technologies for provoking altered states of consciousness, or intense emotional engagement, in which adherents found—or thought they found—access to the numinous.</p>
<p>Psychedelic drugs, understood as providing transcendent non-rational insight as well as orgiastic ecstasy, were hugely important in the development of the monist counterculture. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Potential_Movement">Human Potential Movement↗︎︎</a> turned the quasi-medical private practice of psychotherapy into quasi-religious public performances that resembled Christian revival meetings—and, increasingly, vice versa. The New Age offered consciousness transformation through endlessly diverse methods such as meditation, past-life regression, channelling, yoga, biofeedback, and self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>Before the Twentieth Century, Christianity was mostly about conduct and belief, not experience. This was very much true of American Fundamentalism, which is where the core leadership of the dualist counterculture came from. The idea of “religious experience” is Romantic, dating from the late 1700s, but it remained marginal in Christianity up to the 1980s. At that point, the fundamentalists reluctantly folded aspects of “charismatic” Pentecostalism into the new countercultural religion.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg"><div class="youtube_outer_wrapper"><div class="youtube_inner_wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="youtube" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f5cB9tA1O7M?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div></div></figure>
<p>Charismatic Christianity features intensely emotional worship, emphasizing individual experience, spontaneous singing and dancing, and being “slain in the Spirit” (falling to the floor in religious ecstasy). It empowers supposedly-supernatural practices including “speaking in tongues,” divine healing, prophesy, exorcism and “spiritual warfare,” and (in some churches) miracles such as snake-handling and drinking poison without ill effects.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote20_zst88k0" id="extra29_footnoteref20_zst88k0" title="This has long sounded like big fun to me. I’ve avoided ever going to a Pentecostal service, for fear I’d abandon Buddhism.">20</a></p>
<p>Both countercultures fetishized concepts of a definitive, personal religious event. Supposedly this was an initial, overwhelming, dramatic, emotional religious experience, which lasts only a few minutes to a few days, but which sets in motion an unstoppable process of internal transformation. That is gradual and less intense, but spreads and deepens, and eventually results in a complete reconfiguration of the self that brings it into conformity with the Ultimate Truth or <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss12')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.

<p>Traditional religion mainly devalued the actual, material and social world, in favor of another, transcendent one, that might be reached in the afterlife or through mystical means. The religions of both countercultures paid lip service to transcendence, but marketed their pragmatic value in this world. Both countercultures promised that you could improve your material and social circumstances by reworking your self. <i>De facto</i>, they celebrated hedonism—within bounds—and (especially on the right) enthusiastic consumption of the fruits of the capitalist market economy.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote24_2na19bk" id="extra29_footnoteref24_2na19bk" title="As a Tantric Buddhist, I think this was a very wise move.">24</a></p>

<p>Lifestyle churches showcased religion as useful for personal and social ends, rather than as an expression of devotion to God.

<h2 id="extra29_assessment">Assessment: shooting the wrong horse</h2>
<p>Rationality was never the problem with the systematic mode. The fault actually laid in eternalism. The countercultures attacked the wrong one. Founded on this misunderstanding, it is not surprising that the countercultural religions were mostly stupid and harmful. That said, they were honest efforts to solve serious problems, and their legacies are not all bad.</p>
<p>The countercultural project of resolving the disconnect between self and society mostly failed, at both ends. That is because it left intact the structure of their relationship, tinkering only with reforms in each separately. In fact, by exaggerating both individualism and collectivism, it made the conflict starker than before.</p>
<p>At the self end, religious leaders promised revolutions in consciousness that would bring about profound personal and social transformation. If many monist counterculturalists had succeeded in seeing through subject/object duality, and always acted from non-rational awareness of the connectedness of all things, then the Age of Aquarius might indeed be upon us. If many dualist counterculturalists had succeeded in accepting the <a href="http://www.sermonindex.net/modules/articles/index.php?view=article&amp;aid=18555">infilling of the Holy Spirit↗︎︎</a>, and always acted from non-rational awareness of the will of God, then the Rapture might indeed be imminent.</p>
<p>But this turned out to be mostly wishful thinking. Available consciousness-transformation methods were less powerful than hoped. Mostly, all the religions accomplished was a change in the contents of consciousness—“beliefs”—not in its structure or mode of being. Counterculturalists adopted some new mythology, and many enjoyed transient non-ordinary experiences brought on by drugs, conversion, or ritual. Few selves transformed significantly and durably.</p>
<p>Intelligent advocates of the countercultural religions—both monist and dualist—might say that they should not be judged by their least rigorous presentations, by populist distortions, or by the effects of their superficial appropriations by the clueless and uncommitted. I agree, if the criterion is the usefulness of the religion to a sincere and intelligent seeker. Thinkers from both countercultures offer valuable insights: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078XGIUI/?tag=meaningness-20">Carlos Castaneda↗︎︎</a> and <a href="#chap158">Francis Schaeffer</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HG4WII/?tag=meaningness-20">Starhawk↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SEHSKI/?tag=meaningness-20">Rick Warren↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>However, here I am concerned with cultural history: the countercultures’ effect on the population at large. Some of that was beneficial:</p>
<ul>
<li>In both countercultures, anti-rationalism legitimized temporary escapes from grim systemic regimentation, into ecstatic communal altered states.</li>
<li>Religious methods did help many counterculturalists develop greater psychological sophistication (even as many others regressed into pre-rational idiocy).</li>
<li>The “morality wars,” although profoundly harmful to American public discourse, made more people aware of meta-ethical questions, and helped some <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">develop a more sophisticated ethical stance↗︎︎</a>.</li>
<li>Some <a href="http://aromeditation.org/">non-rational religious methods↗︎︎</a>, pursued with sufficient tenacity, may indeed bring about significant, long-lasting change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, though, the countercultures’ anti-rationality and subjectivism undermined effective systematic understandings, methods, and institutions. (I assume readers of <cite>Meaningness</cite> understand why this was harmful, so I need not elaborate.)</p>
<p>Originally, both countercultures’ new religious movements attracted many intelligent, accomplished people, because they seemed to offer plausible solutions to the nihilism of the systematic mainstream. Gradually, smart people figured out that they were nonsense and left. As the <a href="#chap166">countercultures faded</a>, most other adherents shook off the silliest parts. By the mid-’90s, both the New Age and Fundamentalism were widely seen as “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/#losers">religions for losers↗︎︎</a>.” This has somewhat limited the damage done.</p>

In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.)

If fully implemented, it might make the value of rationality more obvious, and the emotional reasons for opposing rationality less compelling.</p>

The slogan “the personal is political,” originating in 1960s feminism, encapsulates both countercultures’ political agenda. Society had to change to accommodate the self; and political action was the way to reform the social structure.
</p>
<p>Between them, the <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a> shoved aside existing power dynamics and created <a href="#chap162">reorganized coalitions</a> which have dominated American politics ever since.

The countercultures addressed these problems by blurring the public/private boundary: <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political">the personal is political↗︎︎</a></dfn>.</p>
<p>They sought to replace the artificial, seemingly-arbitrary social and personal requirements of the systematic mode with ones they considered natural. They tried to reorient society away from formal, systematic roles toward natural ones: family, unstructured friendships, and local communities. The <a href="#chap157">monist counterculture</a> thought humanistic, egalitarian norms would be more natural. The dualist counterculture thought godly, hierarchical norms would be more natural.</p>
<p>“Authenticity” meant bringing the private and public selves into alignment. This was the obvious response to the painful gap between them.

Both called for a reform of social norms to bring them closer to ethical norms, and for norms to be strengthened—that is, better enforced against wrong-doers.</p>
<p>Power struggles between economic interest groups were the heart of politics before the countercultures. Conflict between the working class majority and the bourgeois minority drove the main ideological movements, and threatened social collapse. Counterculturalists recognized that such conflicts have no “right” resolution. Everyone may honestly believe their group should win, but that’s nothing more than self-interest.</p>

A contest of selfish brute political force won’t deliver that. Ethics—a force beyond self-interest—<a href="#chap51">must provide</a> the right answer for politics.</p>
<p>Of course, the countercultures disagreed sharply on some ethical questions. So how do we know that <em>our</em> ethics are right, and <em>theirs</em> are wrong? Religion. Religion gives transcendent, unchallengeable justification for ethical claims. And so both countercultures merged politics with religion, as well as with ethics.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_7t9t2pb" id="extra29_footnoteref2_7t9t2pb" title="One manifestation: Christian Voice, the second-most-important Christian Right organization, issued influential “Morality Ratings” on every member of Congress, based on their support or opposition to its legislative agenda.">2</a> Not only did they reform politics along religious lines, they also turned their politics into pseudo-religions.</p>
<p>Spiritualizing politics, and politicizing everyday personal interactions, was not an altogether bad thing. Sometimes ethical considerations should trump power politics. Sometimes political considerations should alter personal behavior. However, combined with eternalism (absolutism) and universalism (intolerance of diversity of views), the merger has poisoned both politics and everyday life.</p>
<p>Countercultural politics split Americans into two warring tribes. Lack of distinctions between ethics, politics, and religion is a main cause of the bitterness of <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>. When politics is inseparable from morality, your political opponents do not just have different economic incentives, they are <em>evil</em>: immoral, sub-human, demonic. That makes negotiation and compromise impossible.</p>
<p>As politics came to define what it meant to be a good person, many came to define their selves by membership in one counterculture, and rejection of the other. Political success would require solidarity, and both sides promoted the “brotherhood of all counterculture participants.” However, identification with the monist or dualist tribe eventually proved to be an inadequate basis for self.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left">New Left↗︎︎</a> was the monist counterculture’s political program. The Old Left had mainly promoted the economic interest of the working class. The New Left mainly promoted a middle-class personal morality, and mostly lost interest in working class and economic issues.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_7jl28f9" id="extra29_footnoteref3_7jl28f9" title="Although the New Left was officially Marxist and anti-capitalist, it had no substantive economic program. Its supposed anti-capitalism was mainly actually opposition to the emotionally unfulfilling “iron cage” of employment in big-business bureaucracy; to the responsibility of private industry for environmental destruction; to the military-industrial complex’s promotion of unnecessary wars for profit; and to the inadequacy of government anti-poverty programs. The counterculture was not seriously opposed to a market economy, and was mainly enthusiastic about consuming its bounty of nifty new goods.">3</a></p>
<p>Monist politics addressed the crisis of the self: the problems of alienation, angst, and anomie. It started from an improbable synthesis of Marxism, Freudianism, and existentialism—the most important secular systems of meaning in the mid-twentieth century. These systems utterly contradict each other, and also contradict central tenets of the New Left. However, countercultural intellectuals somehow combined them in an ideology of complete liberation of the individual from social norms. Given this incoherent and absolutist origin, it’s not surprising that many of the New Left’s social proposals were simplistic utopian fantasies.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_loosening">Loosening social norms</h3>
<p>In the beginning, the New Left sought mainly to loosen existing social norms, rather than to replace them. The 1950s had been a period of unusually rigid expectations for conformity, which counterculturalists found intolerable. Many of these norms seemed arbitrary, or obsolete, or simply served the selfish interests of elites. Just throwing them off would be a good start. The monist counterculture was, at first, remarkably anti-authoritarian.</p>
<p>After some experience of the consequences of moral breakdown, the counterculture shifted to advocating social reform based on new norms. These were supposed to be more human and natural, in contrast with the industrial, artificial norms of the systematic mode. Leaders intended to create a supportive and egalitarian society. Not everyone got with the program immediately. So, New Left organizations increasingly demanded “discipline,” and monist culture increasingly insisted on correct “consciousness.” The left gradually left behind its New anti-authoritarianism.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_sexual">Sexual liberation</h3>
<p>Sex is perhaps the most personal and private of activities. Before the countercultural merger of the public and private spheres, sex would never have been considered a “political” issue.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_1cj3kdz" id="extra29_footnoteref4_1cj3kdz" title="From the Victorian era forward, do-gooders had campaigned against masturbation and prostitution. Though these campaigns were public, their objects were private, and therefore considered matters of “morality,” not “politics.”">4</a></p>
<p>“Victorian morality” was still the official public ideology of sex and family life in the 1960s. For decades, it had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_movement_in_the_United_States">increasingly ignored↗︎︎</a> in private—the very definition of hypocrisy and anomie. Improved contraceptive technology and safe, effective treatments for all the STDs of the time removed rational justifications for restrictive sexual norms.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse">Herbert Marcuse↗︎︎</a> was probably the most important New Left theorist. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KR06QK/?tag=meaningness-20">Eros and Civilization↗︎︎</a> rejects Freud’s pessimistic conclusion in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D2ZZ6K4/?tag=meaningness-20">Civilization and Its Discontents↗︎︎</a> (which I <a href="#chap153_Freud">discussed previously</a>) that the self, particularly its sexual desires, must be subordinated to the social system. Modern political repression, Marcuse argued, is based on sexual repression. For the New Left, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution">sexual revolution↗︎︎</a> was inseparable from the struggle against oppressive corporations and an oppressive state.</p>
<p>This program was partly successful. By the mid-1970s, when the monist counterculture petered out, a majority of Americans had adopted a much more liberal sexual morality than was publicly acceptable in the early ’60s.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_family">Family</h3>
<p>The counterculture considered the Victorian family oppressive for all participants, and set out to dissolve it.</p>
<p>For children, they said, the family was a training ground for a future role as subordinates in an oppressive society. The family’s purpose was to create “authoritarian personalities.” Victorian family theorists had made this entirely explicit: children must be taught unquestioning obedience to arbitrary parental authority in order that they will make “good citizens” as adults. New Left theorists believed this explained the acquiescence of the German and Russian people to Nazi and Stalinist oppression. Families make fascists. In America, families turned out obedient employees, cogs in the machinery of capitalism, whose childhood resignation to emotional abuse also made them joyless, compulsive consumers.</p>
<p>The demand that all men marry and support a wife and children doomed many to an onerous and unwanted breadwinner role. The Beat movement—prologue to hippies—was largely a revolt against work, which implied a revolt against marriage. Hippie men too wanted to sleep around, get high, and listen to music—not spend all their time in a mind-destroying job in order to pay for children they hadn’t asked for.</p>
<p>Hippie women were, likewise, mostly not looking forward to a lifetime stuck at home washing dishes and changing diapers. On the other hand, many discovered that the new social norm that they should have sex with any hippie man who wanted them was not so great either. Some did have children, and then hippie rejection of breadwinning became a problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many more-mainstream women found they enjoyed their careers, and relished the freedom from dependency on men a paycheck gave them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">Second-wave feminism↗︎︎</a> began as their political program to end workplace discrimination. Feminism is now hazily remembered as part of the ’60s counterculture, probably because they were lumped together as enemies by the dualist counterculture. The reality was more complicated: feminism was long resisted by most male leaders of the New Left, and of the monist religious and cultural movements.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_community">Community</h3>
<p>The Victorian isolated nuclear family ideal was called “traditional,” but it was only a century old. Anthropologists pointed out that it is culturally unusual. Extended families are more typical. These are usually closely woven into broader clans and villages. Children are normally raised by many adults. Unmarried teenage girls also do much of the work, keeping small children out of adults’ hair, and buffering them from excessively harsh parental discipline.</p>
<p>Marcuse, and other countercultural theorists, advocated dissolving nuclear family bonds and replacing them with extended social networks.</p>
<p>Hippie communes put this theory into action. They address both the problem of work and the problem of family. To avoid work, we all move to a remote farm, where we’re out of reach of The System, and we grow all our own food and make everything else we need.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_fba4fk5" id="extra29_footnoteref5_fba4fk5" title="Communal agrarian self-sufficiency is a persistent, malign Romantic fantasy. Brook Farm was a hippie commune of the 1840s which failed in just the same way as the ones of the 1960s. The Utopia Experiment describes another attempt ten years ago, which followed the same script again. (This one led by an academic expert on, among other things, the existential risk posed by runaway artificial intelligence.) The underlying fantasy is that the choiceless mode would be paradise. The reality is that it is awful in material terms, even when its human relationships feel more natural.">5</a> There we get back in touch with the cycles of nature, live life on a human scale, and do just enough wholesome, meaningful work to meet our own needs—instead of slaving for capitalist exploiters. We hold property in common, so everyone has everything they need. We raise children communally, so they always have many loving adults to turn to.</p>
<p>In almost every case, this ends disastrously, usually within a year or so. The founders have high-minded cooperative ideals, but no one actually wants to plow the field, wash the dishes, or feed other people’s children—and if work is not enforced, gradually everyone does less. (This is <em>especially</em> true of communes whose promise is freedom from work!)</p>
<p>Worse, in the absence of strong social norms, communes attract parasites: freeloaders and sociopaths. The brotherhood of all counterculturalists implies that anyone with long hair can come live on the farm. Soon a lot of long-haired guys show up who expect to be fed and laid and supplied with drugs, in exchange for doing nothing. Often they are surly or even violent as well. We are very nice cooperative egalitarian monist people, and they invariably have some sob story for why they can’t be expected to pull their weight, so none of us wants to tell them to get out. No one even feels they have any authority to do so. After a few months, the productive members of the commune give up and leave; and then so do the parasites, when the free food, sex, and drugs run out.</p>
<p>Communes that succeed have strong social norms. Living there requires high commitment to specific values, beyond the countercultural ones. They are mainly interested in being left alone to do their specific thing, rather than trying to impose it on society at large. These make them <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultural', 'gloss4')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

Unfortunately, during the countercultural era, successful communes mainly ended up being dominated by charismatic authoritarians (who had the gumption to toss out the parasites) and became exploitative cults. Others, more benign, were run by leaders with strong organizational skills, who imposed formal roles and systems and found a profitable non-agrarian economic basis for their community.</p>
<p>The “brotherhood” fantasy, that the counterculture as a whole could function as a community, was a clear failure. Mostly its egalitarian ideals undermined even attempts to create local communities.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_dualist">The dualist personal was political</h2>

<p>Social conservatives, as well as liberals, found the systematic mode’s private/public split intolerable. It enabled pervasive moral hypocrisy, for instance in the form of “<a href="http://www.modernalternativemama.com/2011/04/30/sunday-christians/">Sunday Christians↗︎︎</a>,” who said the right things in public, but whose private lives were unaffected by religion. Your public and private lives must match to make you an authentic Christian. This is what “born again” meant to many: that you walk the talk.</p>
<p>A godless society makes that walk hard going. There were plenty of sinners in the ’50s, but at least mainstream society expected basic Christian morality. By the mid-’70s, atheists and perverts had taken over America. Hollywood and universities and the government, and even many supposedly Christian churches, all promoted sin. The dualist political program was a grassroots uprising for basic decency, for religious freedom, for taking America back to the traditional values of its founders. (Or so its leaders said.)</p>
<p>They cited the Supreme Court’s decision in <cite>Roe v. Wade</cite>, which legalized abortion, as one of the main reasons for launching their counterculture. The Court’s reasoning in this case was based on the right to privacy: affirming the public/private distinction. The personal, said the Court, was not political.</p>
<p>The founders of the Moral Majority—the foremost dualist-counterculture political organization—were also motivated by their disappointment at “born again” President Jimmy Carter’s rejection of “the personal is political.” Carter refused to publicly oppose abortion despite his private conservative Evangelical religious beliefs.</p>
<p>With the Supreme Court and the President advocating moral hypocrisy, a <em>counter</em>-cultural politics was imperative. The dualist political program worked to collapse the public and private in order to return society to natural, godly norms. This project complemented the dualist religious movement’s <a href="#chap160">technologies of the self</a>, which strengthened souls against the temptations of the new hedonism, nihilism, and atheism.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_large">Large-family values</h3>
<p>Dualists agreed with monists that the “traditional family” was not working. They wrote the opposite prescription, though: it should be strengthened and supported, not dissolved.</p>
<p>“Family values” was the central dualist counterculture slogan. For liberals, the list of issues this covers is puzzling. It seems senseless and disparate, and mostly to have nothing to do with families, although weirdly obsessed with sex. If there is any common theme, perhaps it is “don’t enjoy yourself!”—and it is hard to see how that is anything other than mean-spirited.</p>
<p>Social conservatives seem incapable of explaining “family values” other than in Biblical terms. Such justifications are nonsense, because social conservatives ignore most Biblical prohibitions, and they only started caring about the main “family values” in the 1970s.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_upy2n5n" id="extra29_footnoteref6_upy2n5n" title="I put “conservative” and “traditional” in quotes for this reason.">6</a> Before then, conservative Protestants mostly thought abortion was fine. Sodomy had always been a sin, but an obscure one; fundamentalists had been far more concerned to preach against drinking, dancing, and gambling. The “family values” agenda must have some other, powerful, unstated motivation. Baffled liberals may attribute it to pure malice: hatred rooted in innate evil.</p>
<p>I’ve recently come to a tentative, alternative understanding that makes me much more sympathetic.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_iie8cft" id="extra29_footnoteref7_iie8cft" title="This model was inspired by sociological research by Jason Weeden and his collaborators. See, for instance, “Religious attendance as reproductive support,” “Sociosexuality vs. fast/slow life history,” and “Churchgoers are restricted individuals in fast groups.” My discussion here is not an accurate summary of Weeden’s views, and he might disagree with it. However, if it includes any useful insights, they are mostly his.">7</a> If we take the dualist political agenda as promoting <em>large</em> families, its specific positions suddenly make sense. In fact, conservatives do have significantly more children than liberals, on average.</p>
<p>Three <dfn>reproductive strategies</dfn> have been common in America in the past half-century:<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_22y3bto" id="extra29_footnoteref8_22y3bto" title="These are not the only possible strategies. For example, extended families sharing a single home were mainly extinct in America by the middle of the twentieth century. Polygamy had been banned a century earlier. Both are common elsewhere, and more traditional than the “traditional marriage” promoted by “conservatives.” DINK—dual income, no kids—is an increasingly popular non-reproductive strategy.">8</a></p>
<ol>
<li><dfn>Opportunistic</dfn> mating without marriage, and with minimal parental investment—especially, minimal support by fathers. This is most common among the underclass and lower working class.</li>
<li><dfn>Early</dfn> marriage (teens or early twenties); many children, starting shortly after marriage; emphasis on life-long monogamy; and high total parental investment, spread over many children. This large-family strategy became typical mainly of the upper working class and lower middle class.</li>
<li>Marriage and children <dfn>delayed</dfn> to late twenties or into the thirties in order to accumulate resources (university education and establishing a career); multiple sexual relationships before marriage; fewer children; highest per-child parental investment. This is typical of the upper middle class.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “family values” agenda makes sense when interpreted as promoting the large-family, early-marriage strategy <em>as against</em> both of the others. As a political movement, it attempts to get the government to support its reproductive strategy, and to hinder, prohibit, or punish the others.</p>
<p>Take abortion, the foremost issue of the religious right.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_jxt7wcr" id="extra29_footnoteref9_jxt7wcr" title="I could give similar analyses for the other “family values” issues—drugs, pornography, prostitution, feminism, homosexuality, divorce, and so forth. However, I’m not trying to give a detailed account of social conservatism here, just a sketch of a possible explanation of its principle and function.">9</a> Those pursuing the early strategy have little use for abortion, because they intend to have lots of children as soon as they can. On the other hand, unintended early childbirth ruins the delayed strategy by interrupting education or professional career development. Before legal abortion, it forced many women to abandon their life plans altogether. It set many men back in their careers as well, because to support an unwanted child they had to maximize current income, instead of pursuing education or prestigious but low-paid training positions. Conversely, if you are currently unable to support children at all—often true for those who adopt the opportunistic strategy—abortion may be pragmatically necessary. If we assume that sabotaging the opportunistic and delayed strategies are <em>the point</em> of the anti-abortion movement, its moral condemnation of  both “welfare queens” and “selfish career women” makes sense.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_o08da3i" id="extra29_footnoteref10_o08da3i" title="As with any major movement, different people oppose abortion for different reasons. Some have genuine sympathy for fetuses, or genuinely believe that the Bible forbids abortion. However, these moral and religious concerns can’t explain why most Protestants thought abortion was fine until the mid-’70s, before suddenly making it their central political issue. Many abortion opponents do explicitly connect it with “welfare queens,” “sluts,” and “selfish career women,” consistent with a class-based reproductive-strategy analysis. It’s worth noting also that opposition to abortion partly replaced opposition to contraception, which was only made fully legal in America in 1972, by the Supreme Court decision Eisenstadt v. Baird.">10</a></p>
<p>The large-family, early strategy requires enormous personal sacrifice. If you have six children, then realistically one parent does have to stay home, taking care of them all day every day. Many people enjoy caring for children, but doing it almost your entire adult life, with little time to enjoy or express yourself, is a long hard grind, and emotionally restricting. Financially, in addition to per-child costs, the family has to give up on the potential second income. There is less parental attention and less money per child than in smaller families; preparing and paying for college may be infeasible, for instance. For the employed parent, the financial stress and responsibility, the risk of catastrophe if you lose your job, and the impossibility of taking time off, are equally grinding.</p>
<p>Social liberals should recognize that sticking to this plan, in the face of constant temptations to irresponsibility, is genuinely noble. Religious conservatives congratulate themselves on being “moral” because they are “godly.” Liberal atheists should recognize that they <em>are</em> moral: not because they follow the Bible, but because they work extremely hard, for the sake of others, in difficult circumstances, when they do have alternative options.</p>
<p>In fact, because the big-family strategy is so grueling, it needs intensive memetic support. For many people, switching to strategy 1 (abandoning your wife and children, having an affair, getting high instead of cleaning the house, spending money on something fun the family can’t afford) looks attractive all too often. It is easier, more enjoyable in the short run, and might seem rational for the longer term, too. Constant reminders of absolute, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalistic</a> religious justifications help keep you on the straight and narrow. A community—a church—that reinforces the message with social confirmation and peer pressure, checking every week to see that you have not gone astray, is invaluable. And, the Christian technologies of the self were designed to make the large-family strategy more emotionally bearable.</p>
<p>The delayed, small-family strategy is the most personally rewarding, for those capable of it. However, it only makes sense if you have something better to do with your twenties. That means college, and the kinds of jobs that require eighty-hour-a-week work at low pay during your twenties in exchange for prestige or a very high salary later: entry-level positions as an academic, doctor, lawyer, or investment banker.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_opwtllk" id="extra29_footnoteref11_opwtllk" title="Plausibly one reason such professions underpay their entry-level positions is to screen out anyone who would prefer strategy 2 to 3—the lower-middle-class riffraff we don’t want in our office.">11</a> Mostly, these are inaccessible for young people from working-class and lower-middle-class backgrounds. If you are going to work forty hours a week on low-skill jobs for the rest of your life, you might as well have children when you are twenty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are not capable of earning enough money to support a wife and children, strategy 2 is out of reach, and you are stuck with reproductive opportunism.</p>
<p>So it is not surprising that the religious right was—and still is—rooted in the upper working class and lower middle class.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_wtiwc1e" id="extra29_footnoteref12_wtiwc1e" title="Of course, it has never been entirely restricted to those classes. In fact, one impetus to the 1980s dualist counterculture was the upward mobility of fundamentalists, from the rural working class to the suburban technical middle-middle class, particularly in the Sunbelt defense industry.">12</a> And this explains its sudden emergence in the 1970s. Economic changes during the 1960s made strategies 1 and 3 both work better than they had. Increased workplace opportunity for women, general prosperity, and more generous welfare support made strategy-1 single motherhood much more feasible and attractive than it had been. Increasing subsidies for college tuition, plus a widening gap between blue-collar and professional/managerial salaries, made the delayed-marriage strategy 3 both easier to access and more attractive.</p>
<p>This meant that people pursuing the large-family strategy saw greater competition from the others than previously. It also meant many were tempted to switch. That could be threatening in several ways. At a practical level, as an example, for a man, it was more likely that your wife would leave and support herself. (This is why wives’ obedience and dependency were so heavily promoted, and why conservatives oppose workplace equality.)</p>
<p>Psychologically, the shifts caused great cognitive dissonance. Strategy 2 <em>had</em> been the best option for most people for decades—but maybe now it wasn’t? Surely I made the right decision—but now the others look better? <a href="#chap24">What can it mean</a>, when fundamental life choices change out from under you? This provokes confusion, resentment, and uncertainty. Anti-rational religious claims were a relatively effective treatment. You could take <em>pride</em> in doing what was religiously right, at great cost, even though it might seem senseless otherwise.</p>
<p>In fact, over the past few decades, many have shifted away from the early-marriage, large-family strategy. Some have moved in the direction of delay. Conservatives have smaller families than they did—although on average they still have almost one more child than liberals. Many send children to college—despite the <a href="http://heterodoxacademy.org/2016/06/02/nothing-to-see-here/">discrimination conservatives may face↗︎︎</a> there. On the other hand, economic trends that started in the 1970s have accelerated, making it ever more difficult to raise a family on a single working-class income. Many have despaired, given up, and slid into strategy 1—which may seem like total failure.</p>
<p>If this strategy analysis of social conservatism is right, its <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalistic</a> religious rhetoric is a smoke screen. The “family values” agenda is just self-interested: it tries to harm competing social classes and benefit its own. The large-family strategy it promotes is not “more moral”; it is good for some people and bad for others. Forcing it on the underclass—“you can’t have children unless you have a steady job and stay married”—means they will fail, and be eliminated as competition. Forcing it on the upper middle class—“you can’t have sex unless it results in children, and mothers have to stay home to care for them”—eliminates much of their advantage.</p>
<p>Still, this understanding of what they are up to makes me more, not less, sympathetic to social conservatives. They are not just being irrationally hateful. Pursuing self-interest, and moralizing it to conceal selfish motivations even from oneself, is universal. It can’t be condemned.</p>
<p>Also, from this perspective, one can see sexual liberalism as mainly self-interested politicking for strategy 3. Getting to sleep around, while waiting to have children until you’ve gotten your professional degree and established your career, makes your twenties tolerable.</p>
<p>The core of the monist counterculture was college-educated, middle class people in their twenties. Some went back to the “straight world” in their thirties, pursuing the delayed strategy. Some “dropped out” permanently and defaulted to the opportunistic strategy. You can view their contempt for “traditional marriage” as merely a self-interested attempt to harm those pursuing strategy 2.</p>
<p>Indeed, while sexual freedom is functional for some people, the change in social attitudes since the ’60s has been devastating for others. I find plausible arguments made by Charles Murray, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00540PAXS/?tag=meaningness-20">Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010↗︎︎</a>, and Theodore Dalrymple, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1566635055/?tag=meaningness-20">Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass↗︎︎</a>. The loosening of social norms, particularly around sex, drugs, and family, which originated in the monist counterculture and which is propagated by the leftish upper middle class, has been catastrophic for the working class. Millions who might have led decent early-marriage strategy-2 lives have slipped instead into the underclass: destructive drug addiction, permanent unemployment, crime, child neglect and abuse.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_7ndeph5" id="extra29_footnoteref13_7ndeph5" title="Of course, economic changes that have disadvantaged the working class are also major factors.">13</a></p>
<h3 id="extra29_community2">Dualist community</h3>
<p>The monist counterculture’s Romantic fantasy of community was the rural commune. One reason those failed was that most hippies were from middle-class urban backgrounds, and had no clue how to start a balky tractor, snake a drain, or slaughter a hog. The core of the dualist counterculture came from the rural working class, for whom such things are everyday tasks. If only they had been able to cooperate!</p>
<p>In fact, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_freak">Jesus freaks↗︎︎</a>”—Charismatic Christian hippies—formed some of the most successful communes. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement">Jesus Movement↗︎︎</a>, which predated the main dualist counterculture, was an important bridge between the two, working out ways hippie innovations could be adapted for use by Christian conservatives.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_h0kpbmo" id="extra29_footnoteref14_h0kpbmo" title="See Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right, pp. 101, 131-4, et passim.">14</a></p>
<p>The dualist counterculture appealed particularly to people from rural backgrounds who experienced culture shock when they moved to cities and office-park suburbs for work. The main dualist fantasy of community was an idealization of “traditional” small-town life—“traditional” meaning “all the good stuff with none of the bad.” Despite much talk, the counterculture had no credible program for fixing rampant rural social pathology, so this was no more realistic than the hippie commune movement.</p>
<p>Churches were centers of the dualist counterculture. Church community can provide substantial material support, in addition to the memetic and social support I mentioned earlier. However, existing church institutions were inadequate. The counterculture innovated extensively in sermons and service style, music, management structure, marketing, architecture, and social ministries.</p>
<p>The most successful new-model churches grew explosively into <dfn><a href="http://hirr.hartsem.edu/bookshelf/thumma_article2.html">megachurches↗︎︎</a></dfn>, a qualitatively new form of social organization. Like the few successful communes, these became <dfn>subsocieties</dfn>: local communities with a distinctive subculture that served a wide array of social needs. This was far more functional in practice than “traditional small-town life.” Hoping to reform small towns nationally was a characteristically countercultural project; megachurches are a subcultural one. Therefore, I will discuss them in detail in the next chapter, rather than here.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_upshot">Upshot and aftermath</h2>
<p>In the end, neither counterculture had a workable program for <a href="#chap160">reforming the self</a>, or society, or for <a href="#chap159">renegotiating their relationship</a>.</p>
<p>Although the proposals of both countercultures were <em>extreme</em>, neither was sufficiently <em>radical</em>. Both left intact a structure of individuals and a nation-scale society confronting each other across an unbridgeable gap. Both merely fiddled with details on either side of the chasm, rather than proposing a fundamentally different approach to the problems of individualism and collectivism. This is a major reason <a href="#chap166">the countercultures failed</a>.</p>
<p>Their social proposals were simplistic and utopian. Social liberalism is not <em>right</em>. It is good only <em>for some people</em>. Social conservatism is also not right; just good for some people. The fact is, different sorts of people need different social arrangements, including different sexual, family, and community norms.</p>
<p>Later I will argue that this was the <a href="#chap166">fundamental error</a> of the countercultures: universalism. Both tried to impose their preferred way of life on everyone else. However, neither way was accepted by a majority, let alone everyone.</p>
<p>This failure brought out totalitarian tendencies in both countercultures—particularly the dualist one. Totalitarianism, too, makes the personal political and seeks to destroy the boundary between a social system and individuals. It would take extreme state repression to force everyone into a uniform code of sexual morality. Imposing an early-marriage large-family strategy is, indeed, a central project of Islamism, a <a href="#chap164">totalitarian dualist counterculture</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_1dk4gir" id="extra29_footnoteref15_1dk4gir" title="Islamism was founded by Sayyid Qutb, after spending two years in America, 1949-51. His horror at American sexual openness seems to have been a major inspiration for the movement. “The American girl is well acquainted with her body’s seductive capacity. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs and she shows all this and does not hide it.”">15</a> Fortunately, in America, both countercultures grudgingly accepted their democratic failure, with only minor terrorist violence from extremists on each side.</p>
<p>Although neither counterculture’s political program was adopted in full, both partially succeeded in transforming American government, law, and social norms. (More about that in “<a href="#chap162">Rotating politics ninety degrees clockwise</a>.”) Both caused considerable harm to society and to individuals, but also had some benefits.</p>
<p>Making explicit that the self/society boundary needed softening and reworking was a helpful step toward the subcultural mode. The conflict between the countercultures made clearer what the problems of self and society are. It made some people aware that social systems are contingent constructions, not absolute truths, so we all have a responsibility to help them evolve. Although both countercultures were <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss7')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

<p>Subculturalism developed <em>structurally</em> new models of the self, of society, and their relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledging the fragmentation of the self as inevitable made it increasingly unproblematic.</li>
<li>Acknowledging diversity (including diversity of moral views) allows like-minded people to form distinctive subsocieties. This provided a layer of organization intermediate between the family and the nation-state.</li>
<li>Thus, the extreme ideals of existentialist individualism (the one-pointed self perfectly separated from social influence) and totalitarian collectivism (the boundaryless self entirely dissolved in social conformity) both lost their appeal.</li>

<p class="intro_para">
I write this during the 2016 American presidential election campaign, which portends a massive political realignment. The <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a> of the 1960s-80s created stable party coalitions that persisted for decades. This year, they are breaking up.</p>
<p>Understanding where these coalitions came from may help understand how they have functioned, why American politics is so polarized, and what may happen next.</p>
<p>The countercultures redefined the American “left” and “right” from economic to “values” ideologies. Politics shifted from arguments about pragmatic policy questions to fights over <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a> itself. The Democratic and Republican Parties repositioned themselves as champions of <a href="#chap157">monist and dualist</a> countercultural values, respectively. This polarizes American politics irresolvably.</p>
<p>The countercultures’ political realignment created a new, two-track social class system. It’s personally useful to understand social class better, because it motivates so much of what we all do; but it is also always funny, because we work so hard to hide that from ourselves.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_leftright">Left and right vary in meaning</h2>
<p>In any particular time and place, political affiliation tends to range along a single continuum, which gets labeled left to right. However, “left” and “right” mean quite different things in different places and eras. Ideologues often claim that “what left and right <em><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss1')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a></em> mean is”—whatever serves their argument. However, political scientists agree that there is no defining issue or axis that consistently distinguishes the two. In American politics, left and right have been redefined several times.</p>
<p>During the <dfn>countercultural era</dfn>, the New Left and New Right replaced the Old Left and Old Right. My <a href="#extra15">previous page</a> analyzed the goals of these New movements in cultural terms. Here I look at their implementation in electoral politics.</p>
<p>American first-past-the-post voting rules force a two-party system.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_orrhlr8" id="extra29_footnoteref1_orrhlr8" title="This is called Duverger’s law.">1</a> For many issues, there are more than two possible choices; and groups who agree on one topic may disagree on another. These facts imply that the two parties must always assemble incoherent coalitions of interest groups, somehow held together to cover roughly half the voters. When the sizes of groups change, or a group changes its party affiliation, the system becomes unstable, and new coalitions must be organized.</p>
<p>My account of the countercultural realignment is not a general theory; it is about a specific period in American history. There were partly similar political realignments in some other places around the same time. However, the details of the American rotation were unique, and some key events were just accidental.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_y04azu2" id="extra29_footnoteref2_y04azu2" title="According to Frank Schaeffer, who was personally responsible for making abortion a major political issue, and who was extensively involved in the creation of the Religious Right, the Evangelical-Republican alliance was an unplanned and mistaken marriage of convenience that only occurred because a couple relatively minor players happened to hook up. Also, the Southern Strategy was brilliant and necessary in retrospect, but it developed more by empirical observation than rational planning, and was opposed by much of the Republican Party.">2</a> The realignment was driven partly by judicial and legislative actions that granted black Americans voting rights in practice, not just theory. It was also driven partly by economic changes, specifically the growth of the middle class.</p>
<p>So, a “rotation” might have occurred even without the countercultures. However, the parties seized those as powerful, coherent cultural ideologies that could hold together new electoral coalitions.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rotation">The Great Rotation</h2>
<p>Two diagrams summarize the change. The first illustrates the meanings of “left” and “right” as of 1960:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="The American political landscape as of 1960" height="561" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/political_rotation_before.png" title="The American political landscape as of 1960" width="560"/></figure>
<p>The main political division was between economic classes.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_qw7qnwi" id="extra29_footnoteref3_qw7qnwi" title="Left vs. right did not line up perfectly with economics, of course, and there were major political disagreements other than economic ones. Both parties were somewhat incoherent coalitions of convenience before the rotation, just as after. Also, the political alignments of individuals and of groups were generally less coherent, and less polarized, then than now.">3</a> The Old Left, and the Democratic Party, represented the working class. The Old Right, and the Republican Party, represented the middle and upper classes. The working class was the majority, and the Democrats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Party_System">had dominated elections↗︎︎</a> for several decades.</p>
<p>Religions aligned with economic class, and with politics.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_r1xtfwe" id="extra29_footnoteref4_r1xtfwe" title="In fact, both before and after the rotation, religion was the best demographic predictor of American political affiliation, according to polling data.">4</a> The Mainline Protestant denominations were middle class and Republican. Catholics, Fundamentalists, Charismatics, and other “sects” were working class and Democrats. Religious people identified primarily with their denomination, and were hostile to denominations that had significantly different theologies.</p>
<p>During the countercultural era, the main political division “rotated clockwise,” as indicated by the dashed arrows in the diagram above.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_owcy06o" id="extra29_footnoteref5_owcy06o" title="The details of how this happened, in terms of shifts in voter demographics and electoral calculations by the Party leadership, are fascinating in a geeky way. I am resisting writing about that here, because it is well-documented mainstream political history. If you are interested, you could start with the Wikipedia articles on the Fifth Party System, which was the pre-rotation alignment; the Southern Strategy, which returned the Republican Party to power by gaining the votes of the white rural working class, formerly the core of the Democratic Party; and the Sixth Party System, which is the post-rotation alignment. I’ve also written in some detail about the formation of the alliance between Evangelicals (previously majority Democrats) and the Republican Party in the mid-’70s. Theorists disagree about exactly when the Fifth System ended and the Sixth began. I think it was gradual, from about 1964, when the Republicans first gained support among white Southerners opposed to black civil rights, to the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan.">5</a> By 1980, “left” and “right” had new meanings:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="The American political landscape as of 1980" height="561" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/political_rotation_after.png" title="The American political landscape as of 1980" width="560"/></figure>
<p>The new <dfn>politics of meaning</dfn> was primarily a division within the middle class, who were now an electoral majority.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_azojj5y" id="extra29_footnoteref6_azojj5y" title="A middle class majority meant economic class couldn’t be the basis for a two-party system, which needs a roughly 50/50 split. Put a different way, the Democratic Party had to make a new ideological appeal to the middle class, because its working-class base could no longer keep it in power. The party chose to back monist values, including women’s and racial minority rights, which had previously been Republican issues. That then allowed the Republican party to draw away working-class and lower-middle-class dualists from the Democrats.">6</a> The New Left mainly promoted social freedoms and the social rights of non-economic demographic groups (race, sex, sexual orientation, etc.). It explicitly disclaimed interest in the working-class economic concerns of the Old Left.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_z2l95kt" id="extra29_footnoteref7_z2l95kt" title="This was the main point of C. Wright Mill’s Letter to the New Left, one of the movement’s key founding documents.">7</a> The New Right mainly promoted a “<a href="#extra15_large">large-family values</a>” agenda, despite its alliance with business groups.</p>
<p>Religion realigned along with politics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The New Right, invented by Fundamentalists, united highly-observant religious people of all religions, denominations, and sects. The three leaders of the Moral Majority were a Protestant, a Catholic, and a Jew. That was a deliberate statement that all religious conservatives share key moral values, so arcane theological disputes should be put aside.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_5u0ch66" id="extra29_footnoteref8_5u0ch66" title="Conservative Christianity, post-rotation, became largely non-denominational. Given that its leaders had, since the 1920s, wasted most of their energy on vicious sectarian battles over incomprehensible metaphysical minutiae, this was a startling and welcome development.">8</a></li>
<li>The New Left united everyone else: atheists, agnostics, “<a href="#extra11">spiritual but not religious</a>” <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monists', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monists</a>, and Christians who didn’t go to church, or didn’t let God get in the way of a normal life. That last category included a majority of Mainline Protestants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra29_class">The new two-track class system</h2>
<p>The broad prosperity of the 1960s defused the <a href="#chap153_society">economic class conflicts</a> that had dominated politics from the beginning of the century. For the middle class, social status became more important than income, because everyone in the class had everything they really needed. Americans’ class was increasingly determined by their cultural values, rather than by income.</p>
<p>Social status came to be largely a matter of mouthing counterculturally-correct opinions. I wrote about this at length in “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/">Ethics is advertising↗︎︎</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The countercultures split the American middle class into two hostile tribes. Members of both considered anyone in the other tribe <em>inherently immoral</em>. With us, or against us! To be minimally acceptable as a human being, you had to demonstrate commitment to the correct side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The middle class developed parallel social status ladders. You climb one of the ladders by demonstrating skill in conforming to, and expressing, either monist or dualist values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To count as a member in good standing of the monist (“left”) tribe, you needed to have the correct opinion about hundreds of issues. You had to like tofu, Bob Dylan, Cesar Chavez, and Tom Robbins, and to hate nuclear power, Dolly Parton, Ronald Reagan, and the Moral Majority.</p>
<p>To be upper middle class, you need to be able to figure out, on the fly, what would be the correct opinion about things that are new to you. This requires conceptual sophistication: years of study not only of details, but also of ways to think. That is what a liberal arts education used to be for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great thing about the new system is that everyone in the monist middle class could consider themselves superior to everyone in the dualist one, and vice versa. Morally, at least, and that’s what counts in the new class system. Suddenly, everyone was above average!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to maintain above-average status, everyone on each ladder has to constantly reinforce their belief in the worthlessness and moral degeneracy of everyone on the other one. This is one reason the <a href="#chap167">culture war</a> is so bitter and intractable. We fear that if it ended, we’d have to go back to measuring our self-worth in dollars, rather than political correctness.</p>
<p>Also unfortunately, making “values” a major determinant of social worth created an endless negative-sum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling competition↗︎︎</a> for position on each ladder. This game is negative-sum because the main signaling techniques involve conspicuous wastes of time and cognitive effort. Also, of course, the whole culture-war “values” game is negative-sum because it’s actively harmful to social cohesion and sensible government.</p>
<p>One of the best innovations of the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultural mode', 'gloss3')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

<h2 id="extra29_rebellion">Counterculturalism, rebellion, and authority</h2>
<p>The mainstream power structure resisted replacement, so both countercultures adopted the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss4')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a> of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebellion', 'gloss5')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">romantic rebellion</a>. “It’s the system, man!” was the hippie explanation for everything wrong with the world. Or, as the New Left called it, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Establishment">The Establishment↗︎︎</a>.”</p>
<p>Romantic rebellion is not supposed to succeed—success isn’t romantic, it’s practical. But the mainstream was so rotten that it caved, both times, within a few years, making counterculturalists the new Establishment. That left them with no mainstream to rebel against. They had to resort to rebelling against each other, or to denouncing “The Establishment,” which was now themselves. This was ridiculous, and has made a dysfunctional mess of politics ever since.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture was initially highly anti-authoritarian and anti-Establishment, but as it gained power in the Democratic Party, it had to become less so. Its descendent, the current American left, abandoned anti-authoritarianism long ago, and is comfortable using government power to redress perceived social injustices.</p>
<p>The right was traditionally the party of the established order, even though the Republicans had mostly been out of power since the Great Depression. The right’s opposition to the monist counterculture was initially conceived antidisestablishmentarianistically, as preserving traditional institutions against long-haired drug-fueled barbarians. However, by the mid-1970s, a series of liberal Supreme Court decisions—<cite>Roe v. Wade</cite> (abortion), <cite>Bob Jones University</cite> (racial segregation in religious schools), and <cite>Engel v. Vitale</cite> (prayer in public schools)—plus the expected ratification of the ERA (women’s rights)—made it obvious that the system had been seized by perverts.</p>
<p>The New Right organized as a response to these outrages. Allegiance to the Establishment was no longer tenable. Thenceforth, the Republican Party too positioned itself as a radical insurgency against a corrupt establishment. And as the left became increasingly authoritarian, the right could claim increasingly plausibly to be the party of individual liberties.</p>
<p>Decades later, powerful politicians from both parties campaign “against the government” and denounce “Washington insiders.” Such absurdity has had <a href="#chap167">dire consequences</a> for the quality of governance.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_forever">The Forever War, and its end</h2>
<p>Shifting political conflict from economic to “values” issues lowered the stakes, but pumped up the rhetorical viciousness. Politics can often find reasonable compromises, or even win-win solutions, to economic contests.

</ul>
<p>There is a mainstream theory of American political change that says political party realignments occur roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realigning_election#Realignment_theory">every 36 years↗︎︎</a>. This is explained by generational replacement. Some political scientists date <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Party_System">the last realignment↗︎︎</a> to 1968 (about when the Rotation started); some to 1980 (when it was complete). If you believe in the magic number 36, and start from 1968, we are long overdue. This could be explained in terms of Generation X mostly <a href="#chap171">sitting politics out</a>. Alternatively, if you start from 1980, we’re right on schedule for a major realignment this year (2016).</p>
<p>In any case, I see a current shift to politics in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomized mode', 'gloss8')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet.

<p>I hope Generation X, who will be taking institutional leadership from the Baby Boomers over the next decade, will drop the culture war, and can provide adequate structure to keep atomization’s worst consequences at bay.</p>

<p class="intro_para">
The <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a> invented fantastical time-distortion mythologies to confuse future and past. Both created nostalgia for imaginary golden ages, which were actually hoped-for (but implausible) futures. Both promised upcoming utopias that were actually tired fantasies from long ago.
</p>
<p>Both countercultures assembled their conceptual frameworks from pieces of several old systems of meaning—most of which were long-discredited, for good reasons, and which clearly contradicted each other. They needed to hide that behind appealing origin myths.</p>
<p>Both countercultures assembled their core membership from several disparate subcultures. To weave them together, they needed big-picture unifying themes, leading to a glorious vision of a shared future. The two themes they selected were <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss0')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss1')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a>; and so they spun stories of harmonious monist and dualist societies to come.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture appealed to neophilia and promised innovation; the dualist counterculture appealed to neophobia and promised a return to tradition. Neither delivered. In fact, we’ll see, on the whole the monist counterculture took more from the past, and the dualist one was more inventive.</p>
<p>Both, however, drew primarily on the Romantic movement of the 1800s, which was the first to grapple seriously with the <a href="#chap153">defects of modern systematicity</a>, and to propose a renegotiation of the relationship <a href="#chap159">between self and society</a>.</p>
<p>Both countercultures promoted absurd “object level” myths—part of the <em>content</em> of their cultures. These included, for example, the founding of the New Age by Mayan and Tibetan priests and the defeat of the Great Beast at Armageddon. These fables—of the monist and dualist countercultures, respectively—were not seriously meant to be believed.</p>
<p>The countercultures also promoted “meta-level myths,” which you <em>were</em> meant to believe. These were myths about the sources and nature of the countercultures themselves. You were <em>meant</em> to believe that the monist counterculture had a radical new vision for society, culture, and self. You were <em>meant</em> to believe that the dualist counterculture was a seamless continuation of traditional Christianity, as it existed before the perversions of the 1960s. Both these meta-myths were mainly false.</p>
<p>According to Lyotard’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816611734/?tag=meaningness-20">original explanation of postmodernity↗︎︎</a>, meta-myths are the essence of “modernity,” or what I call “<a href="#chap151">the systematic mode</a>. (He called them “grand narratives.”) As modernity’s <a href="#chap153">failure loomed</a>, the authors of meta-myths became increasingly frantic, and their creations increasingly fantastical. The countercultures deluded themselves about their own nature, and that is part of why <a href="#chap166">they failed</a>.</p>

<h2>Fundamentalism is modern</h2>
<p>Fundamentalism is just over a century old. The word “fundamentalism” itself was coined only in the 1920s. It was also only in the 1920s that fundamentalism became a significant force—and then only for a few years, before going underground for decades.</p>

<p>Modernist theology developed in the late Victorian era as a response to the twin challenges posed to Christianity by Darwinism and historical criticism of the Bible. The modernists’ goal was to adapt Christianity to the new scientific and historical consensus, and to maintain the relevance of faith in an intellectual climate suddenly grown dismissive of the authority of Scripture. To this end, they stressed ethics rather than eschatology; social reform rather than confessional debate; symbolic and allegorical interpretations of the Bible rather than more literal readings.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_fii2761" id="extra29_footnoteref2_fii2761" title="Ross Douthat, Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics, p. 27.">2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1920s fundamentalists rightly recognized that Christian modernism was a slippery slope to humanism, secularism, atheism, and nihilism. Half a century later, starting in the late 1960s, the modernist Mainline Protestant denominations imploded. They had eliminated nearly everything from religion except ethics, and then adopted mainstream secular ethics, and so had nothing distinctive to offer anyone.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism suffered a grievous blow in 1925 when its prosecution of the Scopes “monkey trial” (over the teaching of evolution) made it look ridiculous to most Americans. It retreated into a marginal subculture for many decades.</p>
<p>A second wave of fundamentalism <a href="#chap160">emerged in the 1970s</a>, as the innovative memetic core of one of the <a href="#chap157">two great countercultures</a>. This was another period of visible shakiness in the systematic <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mode of meaningness', 'gloss5')" title="“How meaning fell apart” suggests a series of modes of relating to meaningness. In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.) As systematic justifications break down, the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes are successive attempts to relate to the fragmentation of meaning. Finally, the fluid mode synthesizes the functional aspects of all the previous ones. [Click for details.]">mode of meaningness</a>. The “hippie” <a href="#chap157">monist counterculture</a> challenged mainstream systems, with surprising success. It was also a time of rapid cultural globalization; the mass media suddenly exposed Americans to unfamiliar images and ideas from afar. Within the West, the postmodern era was just beginning—“postmodern” here meaning the condition in which all systems have been discredited. Fundamentalism again offered a bulwark of certainty against the disintegration of meaning.</p>
<p>Islamic fundamentalism has a similar history. Although it has roots in 1700s Wahhabism, the movement began only in the early 20th century, and remained mainly marginal until the 1970s, when it formed the innovative memetic core of the Islamist counterculture. The same pattern holds true for Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist fundamentalisms.</p>
<h2>Fundamentalism is modernist</h2>
<p>Fundamentalism describes itself as traditional and anti-modern. This is inaccurate. Early fundamentalism was anti-modernist, in the special sense of “modernist theology,” but it was itself modernist in a broad sense. <a href="#chap151">Systems of justifications</a> are the defining feature of “modernity,” as I (and many historians) use the term.</p>
<p>The defining feature of actual tradition—“<a href="#chap150">the choiceless mode</a>”—is the <em>absence</em> of a system of justifications: chains of “therefore” and “because” that explain why you have to do what you have to do. In a traditional culture, you just do it, and there is no abstract “because.” How-things-are-done is immanent in concrete customs, not theorized in transcendent explanations.</p>
<p>Genuine traditions have no defense against modernity. Modernity asks “Why should anyone believe this? Why should anyone do that?” and tradition has no answer. (Beyond, perhaps, “we always have.”) Modernity says “If you believe and act differently, you can have 200 channels of cable TV, and you can eat fajitas and pad thai and sushi instead of boiled taro every day”; and every genuinely traditional person <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/07/25/how-the-west-was-won/">says “hell yeah!”↗︎︎</a> Because why not? Choice is great! (And sushi is <em>better</em> than boiled taro.)</p>
<p>Fundamentalisms try to defend traditions by building a system of justification that supplies the missing “becauses.” You can’t eat sushi <em>because</em> <a href="http://www.godhatesshrimp.com/">God hates shrimp↗︎︎</a>. How do we know? <em>Because</em> it says so here in Leviticus 11:10-11.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_up1y06d" id="extra29_footnoteref3_up1y06d" title="“And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination.”">3</a></p>
<p>Secular modernism tries to answer every “why” question with a chain of “becauses” that eventually ends in “rationality,” which magically reveals Ultimate Truth. Fundamentalist modernism tries to answer every “why” with a chain that eventually ends in “God said so right here in this magic book which contains the Ultimate Truth.”</p>
<p>The attempt to defend tradition can be noble; tradition is often <a href="#chap150">profoundly good</a> in ways modernity can never be. Unfortunately, fundamentalism, by taking up modernity’s weapons, transforms a traditional culture into a modern one. “Modern,” that is, in having a system of justification, founded on a transcendent <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss6')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>. And once you have that, much of what is good about tradition is lost.</p>
<p>This is currently easier to see in Islamic than in Christian fundamentalism. Islamism is widely viewed as “the modern Islam” by young people. That is one of its main attractions: it can explain itself, where traditional Islam cannot. Sophisticated urban Muslims reject their grandparents’ traditional religion as a jumble of pointless, outmoded village customs with no basis in the Koran. Many consider fundamentalism the forward-looking, global, intellectually coherent religion that makes sense of everyday life and of world politics.</p>
<h2>Fundamentalism is anti-traditional</h2>
<p>Traditional culture is a colorful muddle of customary, local beliefs and practices. The diverse styles of traditional women’s clothing from different Muslim societies, in the illustration at the top of this page, is a fine example. Lacking a system of justification, there is no basis for arguing that other people’s customs are wrong.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_6cu71nr" id="extra29_footnoteref4_6cu71nr" title="This doesn’t mean traditional cultures are particularly tolerant, just that they don’t use systematic logic to denigrate each other.">4</a></p>
<p>Fundamentalism rejects cultural specificity in favor of abstract universalism. There can only be One Ultimate Truth, which must be the same everywhere, so women everywhere must wear the same clothes. Fundamentalism dismisses actual traditions as “inauthentic” on the pretext that they are degenerations from the <em>authentic, original</em> religion, which fundamentalism claims to represent—thereby <a href="#chap163">inverting the actual order</a> of history.</p>
<p>Traditional cultures have a structure of authority: if you want to know what God wants, you ask a priest; and he knows because he was told by an older or superior priest. There are sometimes quarrels over who gets what position in the hierarchy, but the structure itself is unquestioned and so requires no justification.</p>
<p>Fundamentalism rejects customary authorities in favor of a supposed clear and simple Ultimate Truth. It says the traditional hierarchy is “corrupt” and must be swept away. The structure of justification should replace the structure of institutional authority. Fundamentalism is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/04/04/ritual-vs-mentalism/#fundamentalism">hostile to ritual↗︎︎</a>, because that reinforces traditional authority rather than simply expressing the Truth.</p>
<p>Sayyid Qutb’s 1964 manifesto <cite>Milestones</cite> founded modern Islamic fundamentalism. The book’s central claim was that Islam <em>had been entirely extinct</em> for several centuries. All existing “Islam” was actually <i>Jahiliyyah</i>, “paganism,” because (he said) it was not based on Shariah. Or at least not the <em>true</em> Shariah, which only he could discern. All existing fake-Islamic institutions must be destroyed by violent jihad. Somewhat less dramatically, “the absence of strong traditions and institutional ties in [American] Evangelicalism, and its high level of organizational mobility, made it a distinctly modern phenomenon.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_qynanyd" id="extra29_footnoteref5_qynanyd" title="Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right, p. 28.">5</a></p>
<p>The Ultimate Truth is to be found in the scriptures, supposedly.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_cyb7gph" id="extra29_footnoteref6_cyb7gph" title="Alternatively, in capital-T Traditionalism, the Ultimate Truth is manifest in monist mystical revelation. Capital-T Traditionalism is almost perfectly parallel to fundamentalism, except that its religious core is monist rather than dualist. The “hippie” counterculture of the 1960s-70s was also monist, and Traditionalism manages to combine some of the worst features of both the American countercultures. Perhaps because it’s bizarre and repellent at first glance, Traditionalism has had limited success. However, Sedgewick’s Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century argues that it has significantly influenced Islamic extremism.

<h2>Fundamentalism is countercultural</h2>
<p>Fundamentalism, everywhere, became a significant cultural force only during the <dfn>countercultural era</dfn> (1960s-80s). In America, 1970s fundamentalism <em>claimed</em> to be a reaction to the <a href="#chap157">hippie/monist counterculture</a>, which was partly true. However, there was no monist counterculture in the other places where fundamentalisms burst forth, at about the same time. In fact, modern fundamentalism is mainly a reaction to the <a href="#chap153">disintegration of secular systematicity</a>. Each second-wave fundamentalism arose as a desperate, last-ditch attempt to hold meaning together in the face of postmodern <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss10')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.</p>
<p>Recall that <a href="#chap156">I defined</a> a counterculture as a “new, alternative, universalist, eternalist, anti-rational system.” I’ve explained how the American “Moral Majority” counterculture of the 1970s-80s <a href="#chap157">fit this definition</a>. Here I’ll briefly point out how fundamentalisms <em>in general</em> are countercultural.</p>
<p>Fundamentalisms are <em>new</em> (and anti-traditional) because they are recent and innovative. I’ve described American fundamentalist innovations in “<a href="#chap160">Rejecting rationality, reinventing religion, reconfiguring the self</a>” and “<a href="#chap163">Countercultures: modern mythologies</a>.” I gather the fundamentalists of other religions are similarly inventive, but don’t know details.</p>
<p>Fundamentalisms are all oppositional (<em>alternative</em>) by nature. The early-20th-century ones opposed modernist branches of their religions. The post-1970 ones originated as political responses to secular political authorities. Recently, fundamentalists have taken control of some states; but they continue their oppositional attitude even when they exert totalitarian power. Having vanquished the internal enemy, they organize their rule—rhetorically, at least—around jihad against religious enemies outside their state.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_3a67wsb" id="extra29_footnoteref9_3a67wsb" title="My guess is that, in each case, state jihadism will gradually become less effective as a way of motivating and controlling the populace. That seems to have happened in Iran, which was the first fundamentalist state.">9</a></p>
<p>Fundamentalisms are all <em>universalist</em>, claiming that their Truth applies equally to everyone, and so everyone must behave the same way.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_zmd8ygi" id="extra29_footnoteref10_zmd8ygi" title="Or, at minimum, everyone within a large religious, national, or ethnic group. Many versions of Islamic and Christian fundamentalism claim dominion over everyone in the world; Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist fundamentalisms may only demand obedience from all Jews, Hindus, or Buddhists.">10</a> Fundamentalisms are all <em><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss3')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalist</a></em>: they claim every tiny thing has a definite meaning, given by the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss12')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">Cosmic Plan</a>, of which they have <a href="#chap32">unquestionable knowledge</a> and <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>. Fundamentalisms are all <em>anti-rational</em>: they oppose secular rationality, and claim to ground all meaning in non-rational transcendent revelation, as given in scripture. They are all <em>systems</em>, in the sense of networks of justifications.</p>
<h2>Fundamentalism is losing to postmodernity</h2>
<p>Fundamentalism was originally devised as a weapon against liberal Christian modernism: one system of meanings to fight another system of meanings. In the mid-1970s, it was re-deployed as a weapon against two other systems of meanings: the <a href="#chap160">anti-rational</a> <a href="#chap157">monist counterculture</a> and secular rationalist modernism. But, by that point, all three enemies <a href="#chap166">were already dying</a> at the hands of a fourth, more powerful force: postmodernity.</p>
<p>“Postmodernity” means simply that <em>no</em> eternalist system can work any longer. Starting from about 1980, we live in a shattered world: navigating storm-tossed seas among fragments of meaning, mixed up flotsam and jetsam of numerous broken systems. All eternalisms are defenseless against postmodern skepticism.</p>
<p>So, we need to find ways to live without them. Some people built new, smaller, sea-worthy boats—the post-eternalist <a href="#chap169">subcultures</a>—and adapted to postmodernity reasonably well. (At least until <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomization', 'gloss13')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet. The atomized mode resembles nihilism because systems of meaning are impossible. There are no standards for comparing value, so everything seems equally trivial, and equally a crisis. However, whereas the threat of nihilism is the loss of all meaning, the atomized world delivers far too much meaning, in a jumbled stream of bite-sized morsels, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. [Click for details.]">atomization</a> hit.) Others—those who found postmodernity most difficult—turned to fundamentalism, for its promise of <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, of solid dry land. They hoped to preserve a world that makes sense, against the firehose torrent of jagged insanity spewed by the media, and now the internet.</p>
<p>If you understand the defects and dangers of postmodernity, you can sympathize, even if not actually agreeing. Unfortunately, fundamentalism doesn’t work; it can’t work. The deluge is global, and there is no <i>terra firma</i> anywhere.</p>
<p>Most fundamentalists don’t understand the difference between secular modernism and postmodernity. Mostly, they are stuck fighting the last war, with the wrong weapons, against a dead horse. In America, it is <em>way</em> too late to oppose evolution, or sex violence and nasty noises in music, or liberal bias on broadcast TV, or even abortion. Postmodernity doesn’t care about any of that. (Increasingly, conservative Millennial voters say that they don’t consider abortion an important issue.) In fact, polls in the past few years show a sharp decline in fundamentalism, especially among younger, more-atomized, generations. Older fundamentalists recognize, resentfully, that they have <a href="#chap167">lost the culture war</a>.</p>
<p>Third-world fundamentalisms think they are fighting “Western influence,” “neo-colonialism,” or even “Christian crusaders”; but actually the enemy is the atomized global culture, which is as much Asian as Western, and far more capitalist than colonial or Christian. The West can adapt to the breakdown of systems of meaning because we had well-functioning systems for a couple centuries, and spent the twentieth century figuring out why they <a href="#chap153">can’t work anymore</a>. Left behind by modernity, and then by postmodernity, much of the third world never had a working systematic mode, and so now doesn’t understand why that can’t work. As in the West in the 1930s, the obvious response is to try to make eternalism work by force. Fundamentalism and <a href="#chap153_totalitarianism">totalitarian nationalism</a>—fused in every third-world version—are attempts. As these fail, they become ever more desperate, and therefore ever more extreme and violent.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="ISIS fighters including young Australian recruit" height="494" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/isis_dudes_meme.jpg" title="ISIS fighters including young Australian recruit" width="560"/></figure>
<p>Islamic extremism—originally devised as a coherent system—is atomizing. The things young Islamists say and do make no sense in any conceptual framework, traditional or modern, Islamic or Western. Many Millennial-generation Islamists <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6273809/jihadi-rap-l-jinny-abdel-majed-abdel-bary">know the global internet culture↗︎︎</a> better than they know Islam. They are not fundamentalists—following a religion based on scripture—just extremists.</p>
<p>In an <a href="/atomized-politics">upcoming page↗︎︎</a>, I’ll explain how ISIS, the “alt-right,” and “tumblr SJW” all promote politics in the atomized mode—just as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_International_Party">Yippies↗︎︎</a> and the Taliban both pursued politics in the countercultural mode. Since ISIS is pretty much the worst thing in the world now, understanding how this works may be important to fighting it. I’ll suggest strategies for <a href="/islam-atomized">memetic warfare↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<h2>My advice to fundamentalists (and others)</h2>
<p>As a highly religious person, although not a fundamentalist, I share your concern. The atomization of meaning could result in complete cultural and social collapse.</p>
<p>I suggest that you identify your enemy clearly. If you want to preserve your meanings, you need to come to grips with atomizing postmodernity, which is the current reality, instead of wasting your effort fighting obsolete modernisms.</p>
<p>I suggest that it is more important to find ways of preserving <em>some</em> coherent meanings than fussing about details. I would rather see a competent fundamentalist theocracy that kept civilization running than an <a href="#extra14">anti-systematic social collapse</a>—even though you would <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/necrophiliac-dakini">burn me as a witch↗︎︎</a> in the first week after you took power. I hope you would prefer living in a competent atheist rationalist state that kept civilization running than see an anti-systematic social collapse—even if it banned all public practice of religion.</p>
<p>“How do we rescue meaning from nihilistic atomization?” is a more urgent question than whether God exists. Scriptural literalism has definitively failed. You and your former secularist enemies might do well to join forces. I realize a fundamentalist-atheist alliance sounds implausible—but before <a href="#chap158">Francis Shaeffer</a> <a href="#chap162">united them</a> in the 1970s, the idea that fundamentalist Protestants, conservative Catholics, and Orthodox Jews would join to fight secularism sounded absurd.</p>
<p>Ross Douthat, a conservative but not fundamentalist Christian, sees a “postmodern opportunity.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_dkn2db9" id="extra29_footnoteref11_dkn2db9" title="Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics, pp. 278-80.">11</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christian gospel originally emerged as a radical alternative in a civilization as rootless and cosmopolitan and relativistic as our own. There may come a moment when the loss of Christianity’s cultural preeminence enables believers to recapture some of that original radicalism. Maybe it is already here, if only Christians could find a way to shed the baggage of a vanished Christendom and speak the language of this age.</p>
<p>“Radical orthodoxy” and the “emerging church” movement are attempting to rebuild Christianity from the ground up—bypassing failing institutions, avoiding culture-war flashpoints, and casting the faith as a lifeline for an exhausted civilization rather than just a return to the glories of the past. Both have a particular interest in reaching the urban, the academic, and even the <em>cool</em>—which points to the possibility of a kind of revolution from above, in which our cultural elite is reconverted and the country comes along.</p>

The extraordinary accomplishment of the <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a> of the 1960s-80s was to create new, serious, distinctive, positive approaches to all aspects of life.
</p>
<p>Countercultural culture was <dfn>wide</dfn>, in addressing every imaginable topic, and in appealing to a broad audience—ideally, everyone. It was <dfn>thick</dfn>, in that its treatment of any given topic was substantial, dense, a significant innovation, and woven into one of the two great countercultural themes (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss0')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a> or <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss1')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a>) via its <a href="#chap151">structure of justifications</a>.</p>
<p>This contrasts with <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultures', 'gloss2')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

[Click for details.]">subcultures</a>, which were narrow: able to address only a few aspects of life, and intended only for a small specific segment of society. As the subcultures <a href="/subcultures-always-fragment">progressively fragmented↗︎︎</a>, they also became increasingly thin: they lost the critical mass of creativity needed to develop innovative, deep meanings.</p>
<p>Countercultural culture also contrasts with <a href="#chap153">imploding systematic culture</a> that preceded it. That suffered from a profound <a href="#chap154">loss of confidence</a>, and from <a href="#chap153_culture">a split</a> between “high” culture and “popular” culture. “High” culture had been property of the social elite, but turned against its masters, as the anti-bourgeois artistic <i>avant garde</i>. By the 1960s, that had degenerated into knee-jerk negativity and empty simulations of creation, “a series of increasingly desperate gimmicks by which artists sought to give their work an immediately recognizable individual trademark, a succession of manifestos of despair.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_d5madqs" id="extra29_footnoteref1_d5madqs" title="Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914-1991.">1</a> Meanwhile, “popular” culture was mainly trivial; and so neither could provide thick meanings. <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

<p>The countercultures deliberately addressed that nihilism by creating new cultures as serious, positive mass alternatives. This is perhaps the most valuable legacy of the countercultural era.</p>
<p>The countercultures obliterated the obsolete high/pop distinction. Their new art started from popular forms, but also borrowed from the <i>avant garde</i>. Overall, it had greater depth, heft, sophistication, <em>and</em> broad appeal than either.</p>
<h2>Some miscellaneous points I will cover</h2>

<p>I <a href="#chap156">defined the countercultures</a> as “new, alternative, universalist, eternalist, anti-rational systems.” I noted that <a href="#chap160">rejecting rationality</a> was the central conceptual move of both. Anti-rationality was the key to their contribution to the arts.</p>
<p>Hallucinogenic drugs, whose effects are anti-rational, inspired the monist counterculture’s psychedelic art movement.</p>

<p>This theme goes back to the Romantics, though. They too deployed art as an antidote to the dehumanizing effects of modern employment. The monist counterculture drew heavily on Romantic precedents.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture, particularly, harnessed the creative energy of an entire generation into a thematically coherent culture. The Boomer gonzo attitude of throwing oneself totally into a scene, take-no-prisoners, contributed to its enormous power output. This had good and bad effects. It resulted in unprecedented cultural progress, but also a lot of harmful idiocy, and lasting bitter conflict.</p>
<p>I don’t need to go into any detail on the <em>content</em>, because it’s still omnipresent and familiar. Teenagers today still listen to ’60s bands, half a century later—just as they have in every intervening decade. I won’t be surprised if they still do in another half century. Teenagers have not listened to pop music from the 1940s since the 1940s, and never will again.</p>
<p>One legacy: you can buy almost any product—whether a physical good or a service—in monist or dualist branding. As a random example: <a href="http://holisticdental.org/">holistic dentistry↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://www.christiandental.org/purpose/">Christian dentistry↗︎︎</a>. Also, heavy metal.</p>

<p>Everyone in the monist counterculture listened to every genre of popular music. This was consistent with monism, and universalism: music was no longer divided by race, class, ethnicity, or religion.

The <a href="#chap156_universalist"><dfn>universalism</dfn></a> of the countercultures was their fatal flaw.</p>
<p>No single system of meaning can work for everyone—or even for most people. <a href="#chap157">Both countercultural visions</a> failed to appeal to a majority. They were unable to encompass the diversity of views on <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

<p>This page explains how the countercultures:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>failed to find new foundations for their universalist systems</li>
<li>… and so were revealed as idealistically impractical</li>
<li>failed to address the differences in people’s interests, values, purposes, and needs</li>
<li>failed to hold together their coalitions, and so broke up into subcultures</li>
<li>failed to provide strong social bonds—only membership in a nation-sized counterculture</li>
<li>failed to cope with their partial success</li>
<li>failed to transcend their oppositional (<em>counter</em>-cultural) attitude</li>
</ul>
<p>The subcultural mode developed reasonably effective solutions for each of these problems. I foreshadow each solution briefly here, and describe them in detail in the <a href="#chap169">subcultures section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_foundations">Failure to find new foundations</h2>
<p><a href="#chap151">Systematic</a> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a> depends on a foundation: some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss3')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.  God, Fate, Rationality, The Absolute, Cosmic Consciousness, Progress, Science, and many other candidate fundamental principles have been proposed. The view of this book is that there is no such thing. [Click for details.]">eternal ordering principle</a>. On that, it builds a <dfn>structure of justification</dfn>, which gives everything meaning. By the mid-twentieth-century, this had <a href="#chap153">clearly failed</a>. <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Nihilism', 'gloss4')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">Nihilism</a> seemed the only possible alternative.</p>
<p>Both countercultures recognized that the 1950s American mainstream was an <a href="#chap47">empty shell</a>, based on <a href="#chap44">collective</a> <a href="#chap43">pretense</a>, with mere <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss5')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialism</a> at its core. It <em>might as well</em> be outright nihilism, they thought.</p>
<p>But… there is a more generous way of interpreting the “hypocrisy” of the 1950s. Everyone understood, at some level, that the structure of justification no longer worked. However, everyone also understood, at some level, that <em>just pretending</em> was enough to keep the system working. This was actually right, because there never was a genuine foundation for systematic eternalism. In reality, it had always largely run on ritual: everyone acting <em>as if</em> the system was justified. This is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/04/04/ritual-vs-mentalism/">a good thing↗︎︎</a>! The <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/04/04/ritual-vs-mentalism/#asif">ritual “as if”↗︎︎</a> is the only way functional societies <em>can</em> work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, by the 1950s, centuries of belief in the myth of ultimate grounding meant no one could admit there was no foundation, even as it became obvious. That meant extreme conformity had to be enforced, lest some child point out “the emperor has no throne” and the whole thing would come tumbling down. Which is exactly what hippie kids did; and so it did tumble down, startlingly rapidly. Belief in the system completely collapsed in the decade between the mid-60s and the mid-70s.</p>
<p>The kids imagined they could build a new eternalism on a new foundation, but they were wrong. They doubled down on eternalism, and lost again. “Everything is totally connected—peace, love, happiness!” didn’t work. Neither did “Jesus is my personal savior!” <a href="#chap163">Both countercultures innovated</a>, but these foundations were not new, and their inadequacy had already been understood a century earlier.</p>
<p><a href="#chap157">Monism and dualism</a> provided easy-to-understand conceptual themes that temporarily unified the countercultures; but neither actually provided a convincing new system of meaning. Instead, it was this-worldly benefits that gave them mass appeal.</p>
<p>Mainly, the countercultures unintentionally underwrote a relieved regression of their followers into a <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">comfortable pre-systematic mode↗︎︎</a>, implicitly rejecting the new systems created by their leaders. On the monist side: happy greedy piglets sucking at the teats of consumer capitalism, willing to make only symbolic gestures (recycling) toward social/economic transformation. On the dualist side: happily amoral heathens committing adultery, having abortions, and taking drugs, willing to make only symbolic gestures (God talk) toward social/cultural transformation. Leaders of both movements saw these as catastrophic and incomprehensible failures of commitment and discipline.</p>
<p>Subcultures, having abandoned universalism, had freedom to innovate without attempting to justify meanings in terms of any foundation. Some began to abandon eternalism as well, and so to acknowledge <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss6')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>. Naturally, they ran on ritual and creative make-believe: for example, dressing in an elaborate, distinctive, set style to go to a club where a band played music from a genre specific to the subculture, and everyone danced in the ritually correct manner.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_idealistic">Idealistic, extreme, and impractical</h2>
<p>The countercultures had to <a href="#chap160">drop rationality</a> to make their foundational claims seem plausible. This was massively unhelpful. Unmoored from reality, both proliferated idealistic fantasies that the 1950s mainstream would have laughed at. The true believers who tried hardest to put them into practice often ended up psychologically damaged.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <a href="#chap163">mythologies-you-were-supposed-to-believe</a> weren’t believable. Counterculturalists tried, but eventually most found the contradictions with reality too obvious. By 1975, “if enough of us get high, we can end war” sounded frighteningly stupid, and so the monist counterculture was over. By 1990, “the Tribulation has begun—we must institute Biblical law to fight the Antichrist” sounded frighteningly stupid, and so the dualist counterculture was over.</p>
<p>The countercultures did profoundly transform American society and culture, but most people wound up adopting a pragmatic mixture of their views. On the issues they disagreed about most—for instance sex and gender—the majority compromised between their extremes. It became clear that “men and women are exactly the same by nature and should act that way” wasn’t going to work for most people; but neither would “a woman’s place is in the home.” Similarly, life-long monogamy and endless “free love” would both be nightmares for most people. The majority adopted sequential-mostly-monogamy as their sexual morality. That has no coherent ideological justification, but seems to work for most people.</p>
<p>Sociological surveys suggest that people’s moral judgements are much less divergent than ideologues want—and since discussion is dominated by ideologues, morality is also much less divergent than most people believe. The <a href="#chap167">culture war</a> is mostly for show. “Values” talk <a href="#chap162_class">functions largely to signal</a> tribal identity and class status.</p>
<p>Each of the extreme positions on sex and gender <em>do</em> work well for small minorities, which formed subcultures. In San Francisco, you should not be surprised to hear “we’re so excited—one of my wife’s female lovers is having a baby!” In New York, you should not be surprised to hear about marriages between teenagers who have had only one chaperoned meeting, arranged by families who have been in America for generations.</p>
<p>Broadly, subcultures abandoned the grand attempt to reform the entire nation to fit an ideological vision. They found solutions that were good enough for a subsociety.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_diversity">Failure to address diversity</h2>
<p>Universalism is necessarily illiberal: it forces a one-size-fits-all system on everyone. People have diverse desires and capabilities, and inevitably the system is wrong for some. Both countercultures aimed for inclusivity, to sweep as many people as possible into their coalition, and attempted to sweep under the rug those who didn’t fit. Both failed: their overarching themes of monism and dualism were not strong enough to hold together disparate populations.</p>
<p>Social inclusivity was a central theme of the monist counterculture. It championed the extension of legal and social equality to broad demographic groups, such as races and sexes. It united a coalition of identity movements (blacks, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicano_Movement">Chicanos↗︎︎</a>, women, gays) with the claim that <a href="#chap162_rebellion">The Establishment</a> was the single source of all oppression. Theory promised that all minorities would be liberated simultaneously when the system was overthrown. But, in fact, the interests of these groups often diverged, and leaders of the overall movement (mostly straight middle-class white men) were unable to keep them in line with the broad program.</p>
<p>Monist inclusivity also did not address differences within demographic groups. For example, some women wanted careers, and others wanted to stay home and care for their husband and children. “Equality” was not what homemakers wanted. Within the feminist left, some saw lesbians as the vanguard of liberation; others considered them predatory male-identified threats to women’s solidarity and safety from sexual harassment. This produced the first of many feminist fissions—one of the earliest manifestations of subculturalism. In the subcultural era, the left recognized the inclusive counterculture’s failure to address diversity. It advocated multiculturalism (in effect, separatism) instead.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture advocated “everyone doing their own thing”—a plea to allow diversity after the forced conformity of the 1950s monoculture. That did produce an <a href="#chap165">explosion of cultural creativity</a>; but cynics pointed out that everyone was “doing their own thing” in exactly the same way. The counterculture’s universalism meant you <em>had</em> to wear your hair long and smoke dope and worship Che Guevara to fit in. Punk—the first subculture—sneered at countercultural conformism.</p>
<p>Insofar as the monist counterculture <em>did</em> allow individualism, it sowed the seeds of its own destruction. In the mid-1970s, it fragmented into diverse subcultures, which went their own ways. Some people cared more about politics, and continued that struggle—but often found themselves divided over the meaning of “equality” or how best to achieve it. Others cared more about inner transformation, and pursued their various new religious movements. Many felt burned out and disillusioned, and abandoned monist ideology for getting on with a normal life.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dualist counterculture leaders also emphasized inclusivity as a consequence of universalism. <em>All</em> women should obey their husbands, regardless of their particular faith. That’s something dualists could all agree on, because men and women are unambiguously different, and so must have dual roles. (Denying the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss6')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of distinctions is the definition of dualism.)</p>
<p>Inclusivity was also dualists’ route to building a powerful political coalition. The main Religious Right organizations, such as the Moral Majority, promoted common cause among Fundamentalists, Charismatics, conservative Catholics, and Orthodox Jews. They also promoted a united front across a wide range of political issues, such as the rights of the unborn, school prayer, gaining military supremacy to defeat global communism, and opposition to pornography, homosexuality, and miscellaneous other sinful sexual deviance.</p>
<p>The dualist counterculture’s ecumenism was a lasting legacy, but the broad agenda was not. General-purpose conservative political action groups found themselves spread too thin to effect change. Different conservatives cared about different issues. They formed single-purpose organizations that proved more effective.</p>
<p>The founders of the Moral Majority genuinely believed they represented that—but in time discovered that they didn’t. Whether or not it was moral, the Moral Majority definitely did not command the allegiance of a majority. At most, about 40% of Americans aligned with their agenda. Likewise, at most about 40% of Americans aligned with the values of the monist counterculture. Of the rest, some were centrists who found some value and some fault in both. But many wished to be left alone, to pursue their own distinctive purposes, as individuals or as subcultures. They were unwilling to be dictated to by moralizing priests and political activists of either persuasion.</p>
<p>Recognizing diversity, and organizing around it, was the essence of subculturalism.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_community">Failure to provide community</h2>
<p>Both countercultures promised a brotherhood of all counterculture participants. That was not a workable basis for community, because there were too many participants, and they were too diverse.</p>
<p>Instead, the countercultures provided membership-based tribal identities. Unfortunately, identity is not community, although the countercultures often confused the two. These identities were mainly harmful, I think; they did not provide much commonality or social support within a counterculture, and they accentuated the differences between them. Still, for many participants, they persist to the present day. That energizes the <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>.</p>
<p>In “<a href="#extra15">The personal is political</a>” I explained how each counterculture also attempted to create a level of social organization larger than a family and smaller than a nation-state, to provide the intermediate-scale groups that humans naturally crave. So I won’t go into detail here, but briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monists flocked to rural communes, which <a href="#extra15_community">mostly failed</a>, for predictable reasons. Those that succeeded became subcultures.</li>
<li>Renewed practical support from <a href="#extra29_community2">churches as community-builders</a> was an enduring contribution of the dualist counterculture. Churches are places of ritual, and it is ritual that holds communities together. On the whole, the rump of the dualist counterculture is in better shape now than the monist rump, and church community may be the reason. Megachurches are a particularly successful version. Those function as <a href="/subsocieties">subsocieties↗︎︎</a>—a distinctive feature of the subcultural mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra29_success">Failure to transcend the oppositional attitude and cope with success</h2>
<p>You can’t be a <em>counter</em>-culture if you take over the mainstream. You can’t be <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebels', 'gloss8')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">romantic rebels</a> if you control the most powerful government in the world. You can’t rail against the culture industry when you run it.</p>
<p>Because the ’50s systematic mainstream <em>was</em> a hollow shell, both countercultures rapidly gained unexpected, albeit partial, success. Unfortunately, they had no realistic plans for what to do when they won (as I explained in “<a href="#extra29_idealistic">Idealistic, extreme, and impractical</a>” above). What does the dog do when it catches the car? Rebellion <a href="#chap162_rebellion">becomes ridiculous</a> and dysfunctional.</p>
<p>The monist counterculture railed against capitalism, but its <a href="#chap165">brilliant cultural creations</a>—its music, its graphic design styles, its clothes, its films—were perfect consumer products. Hippies and the culture industry quickly coopted each other, fusing monist values with capitalist commodity fetishism. That diffused holistic peace-love-freedom-wow-man themes throughout American culture, but also distorted and trivialized the most serious achievements. The punk subculture was a reaction to mid-70s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_rock">corporate rock↗︎︎</a>: the hippies, punks said, had “sold out” to the music business.</p>
<p>Success was a mixed blessing for politics, too. As either movement achieved one of its aims, supporters for whom it was the critical issue—whether ending the draft, or defeating the Equal Rights Amendment—lost interest.</p>
<p>In 1989, Jerry Falwell, the co-founder and public face of the Moral Majority, disbanded the organization, declaring “Our goal has been achieved… The religious right is solidly in place and religious conservatives in America are now in for the duration.” That seemed true. But it was also true that donations had decreased dramatically, as the golden Reagan years dissipated moral panic; and so the Moral Majority was no longer financially viable.</p>
<p>Paul Weyrich had co-founded and named the Moral Majority, and acted as its behind-the-scenes organizational strategist. In 1999, three years into Bill Clinton’s presidency, and ten years after Falwell’s declaration of success, he wrote a brilliant “<a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/Weyrich299.html">Letter to Conservatives↗︎︎</a>,” proposing conservative subculturalism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We probably have lost the culture war. I no longer believe that there is a moral majority. I do not believe that a majority of Americans actually shares our values. If there really were a moral majority out there, Bill Clinton would have been driven out of office months ago.</p>
<p>[We must] look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture. I would point out to you that the word “holy” means “set apart,” and that it is not against our tradition to be, in fact, “set apart.” We have to look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing the institutions that are controlled by the enemy.</p>

In the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump’s signature issue is “build a wall”—a concrete manifestation of dualism, whose concern is to harden boundaries and sever connections.

<h2 id="extra29_wrong">We are doing politics wrong</h2>
<p>The social world is going to hell. I don’t need to list the disasters happening just today; check your social media feed for full details.</p>
<p>Politics is supposed to be the way to deal with vast problems and impending catastrophes. It is totally not working. It’s the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/12/22/why-polarization-matters/">obvious and uncontroversial↗︎︎</a>. For instance, throughout the past five years, polls have found that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/195632/approval-congress-inches-september.aspx">less than 20%↗︎︎</a> of Americans have approved of the job Congress is doing. Less than 10%, sometimes! Democracy is, by definition, not functioning when most people disapprove of the government. The two Presidential candidates are <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/14/voters-perceptions-of-the-candidates-traits-ideology-and-impact-on-issues/">both loathed↗︎︎</a>, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/193376/trump-leads-clinton-historically-bad-image-ratings.aspx">to an unprecedented extent↗︎︎</a>. The major parties, though supposedly representing the monist and dualist value systems, are both widely considered to promote little more than the interests of their corporate donors. Media coverage of politics is awful; deliberately <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">making everything worse↗︎︎</a> in pursuit of advertising dollars. The electorate is <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/">hyperpolarized↗︎︎</a>, and Democrats and Republicans hate and distrust each other <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/1-feelings-about-partisans-and-the-parties/">more than in decades↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>This seems to be approaching a breaking point: in many parts of the world, extremist parties, bizarre policies, and absurd candidates are gaining momentum. This reflects not a public desire for extremism, but a revulsion with dysfunctional politics-as-usual, and recognition that fundamental change of <em>some</em> sort is urgent.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Campaign poster: Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords" height="542" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/strange_women_ponds_distributing_swords_2016.png" title="Campaign poster: Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords" width="545"/></figure>
<p>Tragically, the oppositional attitude of the <em>counter</em>-cultures, and their mirror-image <a href="#chap157_dualist_dualist">structural duality</a>, was a perfect fit for the American two-party system. In the “<a href="#chap162_rotation">Great Rotation</a>” of the meanings of left and right, “values” captured the political process. That removed many important issues from democratic consideration—because they aren’t about “values.” This is, I think, the root cause of current political dysfunction.</p>
<p>It has also been terrific for the ruling class—both politicians and plutocrats. When politics is <a href="#extra15_large">mostly about sex</a>, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1699/3501">drugs↗︎︎</a>, <a href="#chap160_reinventing">religion</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepe_the_Frog">cartoon frogs↗︎︎</a>, it is much easier to cut backroom deals that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">capture regulatory agencies↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">redirect↗︎︎</a> trillions of tax dollars to business interests. So long as a policy question does not line up with the monist-vs.-dualist axis, it is not “political” and therefore can be sold to the highest-bidding lobbyists.</p>
<p>For the past decade, globally, macroeconomic policy has been run largely for the benefit of the financial industry, at an enormous cost to everyone else. This is not a right-vs.-left issue. It is not even a rich-vs.-poor issue. It’s an everybody-else-vs.-the-financial-industry issue. How can subsidies in excess of a trillion dollars a year persist, with no popular support from either the right or the left? <em>Because</em> it’s not about “values,” it is “not political” under the current definition of politics. The Great Rotation removed the single most important policy issue from the democratic process.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_bafflement">Baby Boomer bafflement</h2>
<p>The culture war persists largely because most Baby Boomers<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_3tyln0y" id="extra29_footnoteref2_3tyln0y" title="Identifying the Baby Boom generation with counterculturalists is a convenient oversimplification. The monist (hippie) counterculture was almost entirely a Baby Boomer phenomenon. However, the youngest members of the demographic baby boom, born in the late ’50s and early ’60s, were too young to participate, and are not culturally Boomers. The dualist (Evangelical) counterculture was led by the generation before the Boomers. It attracted many Boomers, but also many from the first few years of Generation X, who were born in the second half of the 1960s and came of age in the early 1980s, when the Reagan Revolution was at its peak. Polls find that many of them still identify strongly with the dualist counterculture. However, most people in Generation X overall were, and remain, subculturalists.">2</a> do not understand <a href="#chap166">why their countercultures failed</a>. Although the countercultures have been <em>over</em> for a quarter century, participants on both sides do not accept this obvious fact, and are unwilling to draw any conclusions from it. This refusal is what animates the undead Japanese movie monsters—or, to switch metaphors in mid-ocean, it is the reason doomed navies are still fighting from sinking wrecks.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_35lofzn" id="extra29_footnoteref3_35lofzn" title="Jonathan Haidt and Sam Abrams write, in a recent article on political dysfunction: “The end of the Cold War coincided with the baton pass from the Greatest Generation to the baby boomers, who may be more prone to hyper-partisanship. Political views of people in their 50s and 60s are strongly affected by the events they experienced in their teens and twenties. The Greatest Generation – shaped profoundly by the two world wars – entered public life psychologically prepared to put national interests above partisanship, particularly when faced with external threats such as the Soviet Union. But as the last members of that generation retired from public life in the 1990s, they passed the baton to a generation whose political instincts were shaped by the internal American culture war that began in the 1960s. The baby boomers developed their political identities by fighting one another.”">3</a></p>
<p>Many participants still have a <a href="#chap51">wistful certainty</a> that someday, somehow, the glorious counterculture of their youth will rise again, and its <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternal truth</a> and justice will triumphantly replace the corrupt mainstream. (This requires deliberately not-noticing that there hasn’t <em>been</em> a mainstream for decades.) They maintain a rosy nostalgia for the hippie or Reagan eras. They cherish salvation fantasies for the future “after the Revolution,” or “when we take back America.” This is entirely unrealistic, on both sides.</p>
<p>Both sides resent the other as the apparent explanation for their own counterculture’s failure. I suspect one reason the culture war has heated up dramatically in the past few years is that Baby Boomers realize they will pass out of public life over the next decade, and now is their last chance to impose their values on everyone else. It’s the final, desperate push before their time runs out. Realizing that victory is unlikely within their lifetime accounts for some of bitterness of the war.</p>
<p>Maybe understanding that opposition from the other tribe was <em>not</em> the reason for failure can help overcome polarization?</p>

<p>Both countercultures were attempts to rescue eternalism from the <a href="#chap153">threat of nihilism</a>. Both <a href="#chap166">failed</a>, because eternalism can’t work. But when the only alternative seems to be nihilism, any amount of <a href="#chap43">pretense</a>, deceit, and distortion seems justified in defending even a failed eternalism.</p>
<p>The countercultural eternalisms function much like religions, even when, on both sides, they are largely non-theistic (“political correctness,” patriotic nationalism). They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative">grand narratives↗︎︎</a> that start from the sacred principles of monism and dualism, and elaborate into <a href="#chap165">vast</a> <a href="#chap163">mythologies</a> that are supposed to make the central Truth believable.

The countercultural mode was the last gasp of modernity, and the subcultural mode was the first phase of postmodernity.">4</a> and both Truths are false. Continuing to pretend you believe them is morally wrong, not only—but not least—because that pretense has ruined politics.</p>
<p>Some of the hardest-fought culture war battlegrounds are not about “values” as such, much less policy proposals; they are over symbols. That’s what makes it a <em>culture</em> war. Here’s Scott Alexander, in “<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">Five Case Studies On Politicization↗︎︎</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Red Tribe and Blue Tribe have different narratives, which they use to tie together everything that happens into reasons why their tribe is good and the other tribe is bad.</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in them seizing upon different sides of an apparently nonpolitical issue when these support their narrative; for example, Republicans generally supporting a quarantine against Ebola, Democrats generally opposing it. <i>[A quarantine is a boundary—the <a href="#chap95">essence of monism vs. dualism</a>.]</i> Other times it results in a side trying to gain publicity for stories that support their narrative while sinking their opponents’ preferred stories – Rotherham for some Reds; Ferguson for some Blues.</p>
<p>When an issue gets tied into a political narrative, it stops being about itself and starts being about the wider conflict between tribes until eventually it becomes viewed as a Referendum On Everything: “do you think the Blue Tribe is right on every issue and the Red Tribe is terrible and stupid, or vice versa?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some examples are entirely symbolic.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_dyo7zhy" id="extra29_footnoteref5_dyo7zhy" title="This does not mean that the underlying issues are unimportant, or that they are not worth fighting over. However, I would suggest that it is more productive to contest a relevant policy proposal, rather than a symbol.">5</a> A Boomer/countercultural example was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment">flag burning↗︎︎</a>; everyone seems to have lost interest, but that was huge on several occasions over several decades. Current Millennial/atomized examples are the fights over pronouns and <a href="http://www.thetigernews.com/news/clemson-never-had-bans-on-harambe-memes/article_1e4b4eb8-8919-11e6-87b3-db73c6b19d30.html">dead gorillas↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">More typically↗︎︎</a>, symbolic politics contest issues that have some practical importance, but not nearly enough to justify the effort that goes into them; or in which symbolic meanings overlay and distort an underlying practical matter. Abortion—“a condensation symbol for changes in women’s roles, the family, and acceptable sexual behavior”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_ly8fqi1" id="extra29_footnoteref6_ly8fqi1" title="“Abortion Politics as Symbolic Politics: An Investigation into Belief Systems.”">6</a>—is an example I have used repeatedly. I’ve done that because it’s <a href="#chap157_schaeffers">perhaps uniquely central</a> to the culture war.</p>
<p>To be fair to the right, I would like to give an example from the left that is equally important and equally distorted, but I can’t think of one. Gun control is similar in being mainly symbolic: primarily of the culture war itself, but also race, gender, community, and the proper relationship between individuals and the state. However, both left and right are at fault for distorting guns’ meanings and magnifying them far beyond practical import.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_o9fkt83" id="extra29_footnoteref7_o9fkt83" title="For an unusually sophisticated discussion of the ethics and politics of gun control, see the “No Silver Bullet” special issue of The Critique, with fine contributions from both sides.">7</a> Recycling is a left-only structural parallel to abortion—a moralizing “condensation symbol” for monist conscientiousness—but no one actually cares about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Keystone_XL">Keystone XL↗︎︎</a> was less central than abortion, but still “a top-tier election issue for the 2014 elections for the United States Senate, House of Representatives, governors in states and territories, and many state and local positions as well.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_ktyqwsd" id="extra29_footnoteref8_ktyqwsd" title="According to Wikipedia.">8</a> In case you missed the fuss, Keystone XL was a proposed oil pipeline. The environmental lobby, and the American left in general, devoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Pipeline#Environmental_issues">extraordinary efforts↗︎︎</a> to preventing its construction. As far as I can tell, the possible environmental consequences were minor; there are many more important environmental policy questions which the movement has fought much less hard. Although <em>notionally</em> environmentalists’ concern was possible spills, everyone understood that Keystone was <em>symbolically</em> about global warming, and therefore <em>really</em> about global warming—even though everyone also understands that in practice it would have had almost no effect. Other policies affect carbon emissions far more, and might have been altered with far less effort. So why did the left choose to draw a line in the sand at Keystone XL?</p>
<p>In “<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/">The toxoplasma of rage↗︎︎</a>,” Alexander suggests an explanation.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_z7fdlc4" id="extra29_footnoteref9_z7fdlc4" title="Alexander doesn’t discuss Keystone XL, but other controversies in which advocates chose peculiarly unconvincing examples to fight over.">9</a> Advocacy groups deliberately choose <em>bad</em> examples because those generate the most controversy. The one they promote is obviously wrong, so the Tweedledum side objects loudly. However, the general principle is considered correct by everyone on the Tweedledee side, so they feel they have to defend it. Their specific arguments are perforce lousy—even if the principle <em>is</em> right—so Tweedledum senses blood in the water and closes in for the kill. But the underlying, broader issue seems critical, so Tweedledee will defend the unconvincing symbolic example to the death. The brutality of the ensuing battle generates huge publicity for the cause. (And also, to be cynical, donations to the advocacy organization, and advertising revenue for the media that cover it and fan the flames.)</p>

In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.)

They are behaving atrociously because they, like you, are <a href="http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2012/iyengar-poq-affect-not-ideology.pdf">fighting about identity↗︎︎</a>, personal adequacy, dominance, and <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/">tribal survival↗︎︎</a>. And they, like you, recognize they are losing. When you feel that you are losing a life-or-death struggle, you abandon rules of engagement; any atrocity is justified.</p>
<p>During the countercultural era, political conflict concerned substantive social issues, and genuine differences in values. Nowadays, the zombie culture war is mostly <a href="#extra15_merging">about identity</a>—trumpeting loyal membership in your political tribe—and <a href="#chap162_class">about your status</a> within that tribe. That means participants have little motivation to engage in actual political struggles. What appears to be politics is often ritual posturing, communicating to one’s own tribe, rather than engaging with the other one. When culture warriors pretend to promote the old myths, everyone knows they are unworkable, so this is mere theatre.</p>
<p>Both countercultures, back then, tried to make membership in the counterculture the main source of identity and of community. This worked badly; the countercultures were too big to function well that way. However, may of the participants still do identify closely with their counterculture, and do still try to take it as their community, or extended family.</p>
<p>On that basis, anything that contradicts the mythology is taken as a personal attack on one’s self, and as violence against one’s clan, rather than disagreement about issues. Unfortunately, this perception is often justified. When the two sides of the culture war do engage, it is mainly just tribal conflict. It’s meta: a fight about the fight itself. The big question is <em>who is going to win</em>, not—as in the ’60s-80s countercultural era—“how can we change society for the better?”</p>
<p>James Davison Hunter coined the term “culture war” in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465015344/?tag=meaningness-20">a classic 1991 book↗︎︎</a>. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each side ardently believes that the other embodies and expresses an aggressive program of social, political, and religious intolerance. According to their respective literature, each side has wittingly or unwittingly spawned a political agenda that is antidemocratic and even totalitarian in its thrust.</p>
<p>Both claim to speak for the majority, both attempt to monopolize the symbols of legitimacy, both identify their opponents with a program of intolerance and totalitarian suppression. Both sides use the language of extremism and thereby sensationalize the threat represented by their adversaries.</p>
<p>Perceived threats typically engender a sense of cohesiveness among the threatened members. In the act of opposing an adversary, the community expresses a common moral indignation, and asserts its moral authority anew. Thus, not only is the community drawn together, united as a collectivity, but it is reminded of its heritage, its duty, and its mission to the larger world. Standing against an adversary is the ritual reaffirmation of the community’s identity in the face of what may be a far greater adversary, its own internal moral disintegration. It is part of a natural collective response to the threat of the community’s own structural insecurity and moral instability.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_h9f6cdx" id="extra29_footnoteref12_h9f6cdx" title="Quotes from Hunter lightly edited for concision.">12</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I wrote earlier, the <a href="#extra15_merging">moralization of politics</a> has been a disaster. It is reinforced by the <a href="#chap162_class">two-track class system</a>, which relies on the illusion that you are morally superior to everyone in the other tribe.</p>
<p>When everyone in the other tribe is <em>eeeeevil</em>, they cannot be trusted to honor a compromise. The war can only be a bare power struggle for domination; for total victory; for the outright elimination of the other tribe. Not, in America at least, a literal genocide: but many on both sides of the culture war believe that the country can only be saved when everyone who holds the wrong ideology has been bullied into holding the correct one.</p>
<p>In America, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/6-how-do-the-political-parties-make-you-feel/">surveys show↗︎︎</a> that both sides are increasingly fearful of the other, and increasingly angry at them. Each side’s perception that their tribe is besieged, threatened, and may not survive, is entirely realistic. <em>Both</em> are probably doomed. Frantic bailing keeps the wrecks above water—but Generation X mostly doesn’t care, and the Millennials are not organized enough to keep ships afloat after the Boomers are gone.</p>
<p>At risk of sounding preachy: all this is Buddhism 101. Confusion leads to fear; fear leads to anger; anger leads to aggression; aggression leads to more confusion, fear, and anger; those lead to death and damnation.</p>
<p>Standing down requires breaking the confusion/fear/anger/aggression cycle. This page and <a href="#chap168">the next</a> try to address the confusion part—which, according to Buddhism 101, is where it always starts, and has to end.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_disentangling">Disentangling the culture war</h2>
<p>The culture war can be fun—when you feel like you are winning. Then, there is no motivation to negotiate, compromise, or look for mutually acceptable solutions. However, both sides feel like they are losing much of the time, and most people probably recognize that the culture war is harmful, and should, ideally, somehow, stop. On the other hand, the other side is obviously hateful and wrong, so that doesn’t seem realistic.</p>
<p>Anyway, straight-up compromise is mostly impossible, because there are sacred values involved, and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-of-taboo-tradeoff/">you can’t compromise about sacredness↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Progress has to come from better understanding of what both sides actually care about. That must be disentangled from claims they feel they must defend because it’s part of their contrived mythology. I believe that each tribe’s account of its own values and interests is wrong, so both tribes misunderstand not only what the other side wants, but what they want themselves. When that is clarified, both sides may find that many concrete issues, which they had infused with abstract sacredness, are not critical after all. Having discovered their actual interests, they can negotiate pragmatic solutions.</p>
<p>I don’t have a full understanding of either tribe’s values and interests, but I hope to contribute some insights. I also suggest that recent empirical studies of <em>how</em> people hold sacred moral, political, and religious values have much to offer. I would point to work by, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Atran">Scott Atran↗︎︎</a> on negotiating with fundamentalists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Haidt">Jonathan Haidt↗︎︎</a> on the moral psychology of liberals vs. conservatives, and <a href="http://www.pleeps.org/pleeple/">Jason Weeden and Robert Kurzban↗︎︎</a> on political motivations.</p>
<p id="extra29_echo">It might seem idealistic that either side would be willing to make a serious effort to resolve the culture war. Perhaps so; but it’s important enough that we ought not to rule it out. However… time may have run out. The current culture war is led by Baby Boomers, whose age may make them resistant to new ideas; and anyway they will be aging out of power soon. So maybe it doesn’t matter! On the other hand, a new “echo” culture war has emerged recently, conducted largely by Millennials over social media. The <a href="/atomized-politics">atomized, echo war↗︎︎</a> has some—not all—of the same dynamics as the countercultural one, so some of the same resolution methods may apply.</p>
<p>Much of my analysis is on the next page, “<a href="#chap168">Completing the countercultures</a>.” I apply the <a href="#chap14">fundamental method</a> of the <cite>Meaningness</cite> book: understanding a conflict in terms of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss10')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness.

The remainder of this section makes some other, tentative, basic suggestions that are not particularly connected with the <cite>Meaningness</cite> framework.</p>
<p>Disentangling morality from politics would be enormously helpful. This might require a better popular understanding of the <a href="#chap127">functions of morality</a>—both its legitimate and its illegitimate ones. In the culture war, moral judgement functions mainly to maintain self-esteem through self-justification and tribal identification, including demonizing the other tribe.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_bcmrhja" id="extra29_footnoteref13_bcmrhja" title="In The Moral Fool, Hans-Georg Moeller writes: “Morality is the condition of the market of social esteem. Morality is neither customary behavior nor a set of principles, but the actual social differentiation between those who are deemed good and those who are deemed bad or evil.” And: “Morality is not so much an inner conviction that prevents people from doing bad things as a rhetorical device that helps them justify their actions before and after they act. In fact morality often leads people to commit extreme acts in the name of good—that others will view as bad or even evil. The Zhuangzi observes that this is the primary effect of morality. A society in which there is a lot of moral talk will not have fewer crimes. All the moralists in the world have not, so far, prevented war and murder. There is no correlation between more moral talk and a better world. Moral language, in fact, seems to be part of the problem, not the solution.”">13</a> That is, you try to convince yourself, and your community, that you are a good person because you are On The Right Side, and you loathe the other tribe more than anyone. Besides the harm done, this actually doesn’t work very well. Self-righteous contempt delivers a momentary confidence boost, but in the long run hatred doesn’t feel all that great. Also, it forces you into constant anxious competition to see who is best at proclaiming tribal dogmas. There are other, better bases for self-esteem. Could we make this common knowledge?</p>
<p>Research<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_ukeicn7" id="extra29_footnoteref14_ukeicn7" title="This discussion is subject to the caveat that social psychology is currently (2016) experiencing a crisis of replicability. Common research methods have been found to be unreliable, and it appears that much of what was thought to be known in the field is not true. I’m not close enough to the field to have an opinion about which of the studies I cite are likely to hold up.">14</a> suggests that the differences in values between the tribes are much smaller than both think. Most supposed conflicts in fundamental values are actually disagreements about concrete issues (is euthanasia OK? is cultural appropriation OK?) that were given symbolic significance through mythological reasoning. Research finds that there <em>are</em> differences in fundamental values, but they are only matters of degree: differing emphasis when evaluating competing moral considerations. For example, Haidt and his collaborators found that conservatives give greater weight to purity, as a fundamental principle, and progressives give greater weight to care for others. (The division between pure and impure is a dualist concern, and connection with others is a monist one.) But everyone recognizes the significance of both.</p>
<p>Arnold Kling, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CCGF81Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Three Languages of Politics↗︎︎</a>, similarly suggests that progressives are primarily concerned with oppression, conservatives with civilization vs. barbarism, and libertarians with freedom vs. coercion. When each group talks politics, they make claims exclusively in terms of one of these moral axes, ignoring the other two. Consequently, they talk past each other; no one hears arguments from the other groups.</p>
<p>On this account, progressivism, conservatism, and libertarianism are all simplistic: they sacrifice moral accuracy for ideological consistency. It is much easier to make moral judgements by taking only one of three factors into account—but you will often get the wrong answer.</p>
<p>Kling’s framework gives me hope: everyone can agree that oppression is bad, civilization is good, and freedom is good. There is no fundamental values conflict: conservatives do not favor oppression, and progressives do not favor barbarism—despite accusations from the other side in both cases. And no one favors coercion for its own sake. In some concrete cases, there are tradeoffs between the considerations; these can be negotiated only when all are recognized and understood.</p>
<p id="extra29_change_mind">Several empirical studies suggest that opposing political groups <em>can</em> come to understand each other if they learn to talk in terms of the other side’s preferred fundamental values. Not only that; they can often even change the other side’s mind that way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We presented two messages in support of same-sex marriage. One message emphasized the need for equal rights for same-sex couples. It is framed in terms of a value—equality—that research has shown resonates more strongly among liberals than conservatives. The other message was designed to appeal to values of patriotism and group loyalty, which have been shown to resonate more with conservatives. (It argued that “same-sex couples are proud and patriotic Americans” who “contribute to the American economy and society.”) Conservatives supported same-sex marriage significantly more if they read the patriotism message rather than the fairness one.</p>
<p>In a parallel experiment, we presented two messages in support of increased military spending. One argued that we should “take pride in our military,” which “unifies us both at home and abroad.” The other argued that, through the military, the poor and disadvantaged “can achieve equal standing,” by ensuring they have “a reliable salary and a future apart from the challenges of poverty and inequality.” Liberals expressed significantly greater support for increasing military spending if they read the fairness message rather than the patriotism one.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_88ztc8a" id="extra29_footnoteref15_88ztc8a" title="Quotes from “The Key to Political Persuasion,” lightly edited for concision.">15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s Robb Willer and Matthew Feinberg, in “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/opinion/sunday/the-key-to-political-persuasion.html?_r=0">The Key to Political Persuasion↗︎︎</a>,” summarizing their “<a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/2f07d4_546b1b3a850a4271a3b3d2283609e6d9.pdf">From Gulf to Bridge: When Do Moral Arguments Facilitate Political Influence?↗︎︎</a>.” Scott Alexander <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/10/16/five-case-studies-on-politicization/">riffs on↗︎︎</a> <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/1/56">another of their papers↗︎︎</a>, on persuading conservatives to care about global warming by using the language of moral purity.</p>
<p>As Willer, Feinberg, and Alexander all note, few people are currently either willing or able to switch moral languages.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_65dswpm" id="extra29_footnoteref16_65dswpm" title="Relatedly, research by Haidt, and by Willer and Feinberg, shows that liberals and conservatives believe they understand each other’s values much better than they actually do.">16</a> (Partly because political arguments are not <em>meant</em> to persuade the other side: they are meant to demonstrate conformity—or, even better, virtuosity—to your own.)

<li>Write another brief argument—a few sentences—explaining why legal same-sex marriage is a good thing, in terms of the values language preferred by social conservatives: decency, loyalty, sanctity, purity, respect. Make it significantly different from Willer and Feinberg’s “proud and patriotic, contributing to America.” (This is easier than parts 2 and 3: some social conservatives <em>do</em> support same-sex marriage based on fundamental conservative values.)</li>
<li>Write an argument explaining why same-sex marriage should be prohibited, in terms of the values language progressives prefer: oppression, care, fairness, equality. (This is more difficult, but it’s entirely possible—although I doubt you could convince many progressives.)</li>

<p>(This is an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_Turing_Test">ideological Turing Test↗︎︎</a>.”)</p>
<p>In “<a href="#chap33">The illusion of understanding</a>,” I reviewed research that showed that people <em>think</em> they <a href="#chap33_politics">understand politics</a> much better than they actually do. Experimenters asked people to explain how a proposed policy, which they favored, would work. (Rather than to explain why it is Right!) Mostly, they couldn’t, which led them to realize they didn’t know.</p>
<p>The result was that they expressed more moderate opinions, and became less willing to make political donations in support of the programs, after discovering that they didn’t understand them as well as they had thought. I find this cheering.</p>
<p id="extra29_Weeden">Weeden and Kurzban, in research summarized in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KUCTP2C/?tag=meaningness-20">The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won’t Admit It↗︎︎</a>, find that differing pragmatic interests explain Americans’ political opinions better than differing ideological “values.” Supposed moral considerations are often just rationalizations for advocating government policies that will benefit you and your community (often at the expense of many or most other people).</p>
<p>Their discussion of sexual politics inspired mine in “<a href="#extra15_large">The personal is political</a>.” Analyzing politics, as I did there, in terms of <a href="#extra15_large">three competing reproductive strategies</a> may help both sides of the culture war understand each other’s interests, find unexpected areas of agreement, and negotiate pragmatic truces where there are genuine conflicts.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_wpoihni" id="extra29_footnoteref17_wpoihni" title="This analysis is highly tentative and may be entirely wrong; but perhaps even then it can show the form of a resolution of cultural conflict through understanding.">17</a></p>
<p>To recap, the three strategies are:</p>
<ol>
<li><dfn>Opportunistic</dfn> mating without marriage, and with minimal parental investment—especially, minimal support by fathers. This is most common among the underclass and lower working class.</li>
<li><dfn>Early</dfn> marriage (teens or early twenties); many children, starting shortly after marriage; emphasis on life-long monogamy; and high total parental investment, spread over many children. This large-family strategy became typical in the upper working class and lower middle class.</li>
<li>Marriage and children <dfn>delayed</dfn> to late twenties or into the thirties in order to accumulate resources (university education and establishing a career); multiple sexual relationships before marriage; fewer children; highest per-child parental investment. This is typical of the upper middle class.</li>
</ol>
<p>I found that setting aside “Biblical values” rhetoric, and understanding social conservatism as self-interested advocacy for government support for the large-family strategy, makes me more—not less—sympathetic. I don’t want a large family, but I can now see why people who do would adopt “moral” views that had previously made no sense to me. I don’t have a problem with their pursuing that strategy, so long as they leave others alone to pursue different ones.</p>
<p>Relatedly, Charles Murray <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00540PAXS/?tag=meaningness-20">points out↗︎︎</a> that upper-middle-class liberals conform to key conservative values better than conservatives do: honest hard work, stable marriages, responsible parenting, and functional community. He advocates that they “preach what they practice,” rather than promoting an ideology that excuses and promotes dysfunctional behavior in the lower classes. This also makes sense to me.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_l93bkr2" id="extra29_footnoteref18_l93bkr2" title="This does not imply that I agree with most of what he says, there or elsewhere.">18</a> It could be helpful for both conservatives and liberals to admit that strategies 2 and 3 have much in common, and have things to learn from each other.</p>
<p>On this analysis, both conservatives and middle-class liberals deliberately conflate strategies 1 and 3. It’s rhetorically convenient for social conservatives to lump together everyone else, indistinguishably, as sexual deviants. However, the typical sexual behavior of people pursuing strategies 1 and 3 is entirely different. Middle class liberals, when having casual sex before marriage, are usually careful not to get pregnant; the same cannot be said for the underclass. Conservatives choose, unhelpfully, not to recognize that sexual permissiveness has different consequences for different groups.</p>
<p>At the same time, liberals’ admirable concern for the oppressed leads them to express solidarity with members of the underclass pursuing strategy 1. This may blind them to the realities of underclass dysfunction—notably including the bad consequences of teenage pregnancy and single-parent families. The incentives faced by people pursuing strategy 1 are radically different from those in strategy 3—more different than either is from strategy 2. Pretending otherwise, however well intentioned, does no one any good—including not the underclass themselves.</p>
<p>If it is true that the fundamental issue dividing social conservatives and liberals is early marriage and large families vs. late and small, there are genuine differences of pragmatic interest. Both will naturally want the government and other institutions to support their own strategy. However, if both sides recognize that this is what they really disagree about, perhaps they can agree to let each other get on with their own strategy, and to allow an even playing field rather than demanding policy preferences for their tribe.</p>

<li class="footnote" id="extra29_footnote13_bcmrhja"><a class="footnote-label" href="#extra29_footnoteref13_bcmrhja">13.</a> In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006G0CZRE/?tag=meaningness-20">The Moral Fool↗︎︎</a>, Hans-Georg Moeller writes: “Morality is the condition of the market of social esteem. Morality is neither customary behavior nor a set of principles, but the actual social differentiation between those who are deemed good and those who are deemed bad or evil.” And: “Morality is not so much an inner conviction that prevents people from doing bad things as a rhetorical device that helps them justify their actions before and after they act. In fact morality often leads people to commit extreme acts in the name of good—that others will view as bad or even evil. The Zhuangzi observes that this is the primary effect of morality. A society in which there is a lot of moral talk will not have fewer crimes. All the moralists in the world have not, so far, prevented war and murder. There is no correlation between more moral talk and a better world. Moral language, in fact, seems to be part of the problem, not the solution.”</li>

<li>war was perhaps the most important <em>social</em> issue.</li>
</ul>
<!--break-->
<p>The same style of analysis would apply to many other contentious topics. The aim here, though, is not to resolve any concrete issues, but to show how the framework applies in general.</p>
<p>This may seem academic, because after the countercultural era ended most people rejected its most extreme monist and dualist positions. However, it has continuing relevance to our current culture war, which is partly a <a href="#chap167">legacy of the countercultures</a>. I will also preview the ways subsequent <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'modes of meaningness', 'gloss7')" title="“How meaning fell apart” suggests a series of modes of relating to meaningness. In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.) As systematic justifications break down, the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes are successive attempts to relate to the fragmentation of meaning. Finally, the fluid mode synthesizes the functional aspects of all the previous ones. [Click for details.]">modes of meaningness</a> have moderated and complicated the monist/dualist conflict.</p>
<p>Additionally, monism and dualism are confusions of meaning that everyone sometimes falls into personally. Even if this page had no relevance to contemporary politics, seeing how monism and dualism played out decades ago may help understand them psychologically.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_boundaries">Boundaries are nebulous yet patterned</h2>
<p><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Confused stances', 'gloss8')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">Confused stances</a> are defensive responses to <dfn>nebulosity</dfn>. “Nebulosity” is the <a href="#chap9">unstable, uncertain, fluid, complex, and ill-defined</a> nature of all meanings. These properties often seem unwelcome. The lack of any solid ground makes it difficult to build a durable personal identity, social structure, or political movement.</p>
<p>Confused stances are attractive because they <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'deny', 'gloss9')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense.

It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixate</a> meanings: to nail them in place so they will behave themselves. That <a href="#chap11">is impossible</a>, so the confused stances are all <a href="#chap8">factually wrong</a> and harmful. The culture war “values” issues are exceptionally nebulous, which makes the denial especially counterproductive here.</p>
<p>I <a href="#chap157">have suggested</a> that <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss11')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss12')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a> are the central themes of the two countercultures. These two confused stances concern boundaries: both physical boundaries and the boundaries between categories. Monism denies boundaries and distinctions; dualism fixates them as perfectly sharp.</p>
<p>Boundaries are generally nebulous; they represent real patterns, but are not objectively fixed. So, monism and dualism are both wrong.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Mandelbrot fractal" height="560" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/Mandelbrot_560x560.jpg" title="Mandelbrot fractal" width="560"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">The boundary of the Mandelbrot fractal is literally infinitely complicated</figcaption></figure>
<p>Boundaries are not merely existent and nebulous, they are complicated. If you imagine putting one under a metaphorical magnifying glass, broadening out and fuzzing the line, you would see the elaborate swirling patterns of sameness and difference in the vicinity: both within and without.</p>
<p>Close to the boundary, it becomes impossible to say which side some items are on. Some also pass through freely; whereas others are stopped. Typically boundaries are <em>selectively</em> permeable.</p>
<p>Both monism and dualism deny complexity, which is part of their appeal. They promise simplicity and clarity. But they can do that only by hiding the variability and ambiguity of reality. It is this complexity which the complete stance recovers.</p>
<p>However, they are both also partly right. Monism recognizes that boundaries are never absolute; dualism recognizes that they are important, and can’t (and shouldn’t) be wished away. It would help cool the culture war if each side could concede what is right in the other’s fundamental stance.</p>
<p><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Complete stances', 'gloss13')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">Complete stances</a> neither deny nor fixate meanings. They recognize both nebulosity and <dfn><a href="#chap10">pattern</a></dfn>: the fact that meanings are, to varying extents, also reliable, distinct, enduring, clear, and definite.</p>
<p>I call the complete stance with regard to boundaries “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss14" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'participation', 'gloss14')" title="Participation is the stance that there is no single right way of drawing boundaries around objects, or between self and other.  Things are connected in many different ways and to different degrees; they may also be irrelevant to each other, or to you.  Connections are formed by meaningful, on-going interaction. [Click for details.]">participation</a>.” It is simply the recognition that boundaries are always both nebulous and patterned. That combines the valid insights of both monism and dualism; which is what makes it “complete.” (The title of this page is a slight pun: ideally, I would like to see the complete stance <em>finish</em> the war between the countercultures; in theory it could do that by including what is right in both of them.)</p>
<p>At an individual, psychological level, the <a href="#chap14">fundamental method</a> for resolving a confusion of meaning is to look for unacknowledged nebulosity; to notice why it is unwanted; to watch how patterns of meaning are fixated and denied in order to avoid recognizing nebulosity; and to work out what it would imply if this nebulosity were acknowledged as inherent and unavoidable, but not a defect in the fundamental nature of reality. “This nebulosity is not a cosmic problem”—maybe not much of a problem at all!—is a summary of all the complete stances. The <a href="#chap175">fluid mode</a> extends this method from the individual to the social and cultural level.</p>
<p>Nebulosity and pattern are both obvious everywhere, so the complete stances are obviously right (and the confused ones are obviously wrong). However, the confused stances are more appealing, so we keep returning to them.</p>
<p>The seeming clarity of the confused stances is particularly appealing—ironically—when you feel stressed and therefore confused. The culture war is stressful; when you feel confused and threatened by challenges to your “values,” you retreat to a simple, extreme view that you know is wrong, but that seems <a href="#chap47">defensible in its absolutism</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_gender">Gender</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">Second-wave feminism↗︎︎</a> emerged during the countercultural era. It focussed initially on workplace equality, and broadened into a general equality movement. The theme of equality—sameness—resonated with the monist counterculture. The two joined in an alliance which evolved into the mainstream left.</p>
<p>Second wave theorists mostly argued that gender was a lie: an imposed and arbitrary social and cultural fiction with no basis in reality. They denied the existence, or at least the legitimacy, of any difference between male and female—sometimes even at the crudest biological level. Even to this day, there are gender-studies professors who claim that it has no physiological or genetic basis whatsoever.</p>
<p>Symmetrically: dualist theorists insisted that men and women are properly, essentially, immutably, and totally different; and that society and culture must reflect and enforce the boundary between them. Even to this day, there are religious leaders who claim that on October 27th, 4004 B.C., God decreed the gender roles of 1950s Topeka Kansas as universal and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss15" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal', 'gloss15')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternal</a>.</p>
<p>During the countercultural era, when we <a href="#chap160">tried hard to reject rationality</a>, these extreme claims seemed somehow plausible. Once the era ended, the spell broke. Gender can’t be wished away, nor is it ever an entirely hard and fast division.</p>
<p>On average, the sexes are distinct from each other in many ways, but individuals of each sex span the range of variation. Men are diverse; women are diverse. Most men are obviously men and most women are obviously women. Some people don’t fit neatly into either category, for various reasons. There is no essential characteristic that makes someone definitely male or female, masculine or feminine. Most people are reasonably comfortable with the somewhat-different expectations contemporary society and culture have for men and women. A minority find them burdensome. No one conforms to them perfectly consistently—nor can, nor should.</p>
<p>This common-sense understanding, that gender is a strongly patterned but nebulous distinction, is the unexciting core of a complete stance. Most people now accept it—implicitly, at least. Both countercultural approaches are obviously wrong. Despite some irritations, the mingled ambiguity and definiteness of gender isn’t a big problem for most people most of the time.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_rtms5fp" id="extra29_footnoteref2_rtms5fp" title="The word most is important. Suffering can be extreme for those who accept the nebulosity of their gender, but find it rejected by others; and for those who recoil from, and cannot accept, the nebulosity of their own gender, or that of people they care about.">2</a> It’s mostly only professional ideologues and committed amateur culture warriors who still promote absolutist monist or dualist views.</p>
<p>Since the end of the countercultural era, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss16" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subculturalism', 'gloss16')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none. Subculturalism abandons eternalism and instead provides multiple “neotribal” systems of meaning that are meant to appeal only to small communities (subsocieties) of like-minded people. [Click for details.]">subculturalism</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss17" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomization', 'gloss17')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet. The atomized mode resembles nihilism because systems of meaning are impossible. There are no standards for comparing value, so everything seems equally trivial, and equally a crisis. However, whereas the threat of nihilism is the loss of all meaning, the atomized world delivers far too much meaning, in a jumbled stream of bite-sized morsels, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. [Click for details.]">atomization</a> have further complicated the meanings of gender. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_sex_wars">lesbian sex wars↗︎︎</a> split countercultural second-wave feminism into numerous subcultural third-wave sects, which took diverse stances on the metaphysics of gender, with further contributions from LGBTIQA movements. In atomization, intersectional fourth-wave feminism lost coherence, and deploys whatever shards of contradictory, shattered subcultural ideologies are convenient in the moment. I will discuss these developments later in the book.</p>
<p>And what of the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss18" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss18')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance. It incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism, recognizing that meaningness is always both patterned and nebulous. Likewise, the fluid mode acknowledges structures of meaning without attempting rigid foundations. Its values are collaboration, creativity, improvisation, intimacy, disposability, aesthetics, and spiritual depth through community participation. [Click for details.]">fluid mode</a>, which supposedly reflects the complete stance? I’ll give a brief account here, which may seem incomprehensible at this point; the fluidity chapter should make it clear.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_sr28nrb" id="extra29_footnoteref3_sr28nrb" title="This account draws heavily both on ethnomethodology and on Kegan’s account of “stage 5” as context-responsive non-systematic activity that is meta to multiple formal systems.">3</a></p>
<p>Let’s go back to the metaphor of putting a boundary under a magnifying glass to see the details of its complex nebulosity. On the micro scale, gender manifests in a pattern of interaction between specific people in a specific situation at a specific time. Observed carefully, one sees that <em>what counts as</em> a masculine or feminine way of interacting is a continually renegotiated, ongoing accomplishment of the participants. This does not mean it is arbitrary; indeed, it is responsive to the particulars of the situation in exquisitely fine detail. It is also, usually, so routine that it goes unnoticed. It is only when it breaks down that the nebulosity of gender comes momentarily into consciousness—before participants more-or-less skillfully repair the breach and restore its ordinary smooth operation.</p>
<p>This micro-level continual re-accomplishment necessarily <em>orients to</em> macro-scale universalist ideologies. In no social situation can we be entirely unconscious of numerous, diverse theories of what all men and women always are, or always ought to be. We can never act without some awareness of how our actions will be interpreted as meaningful according to those accounts. However, our micro-scale activity—what we say, how we say it, our body language—is never <em>governed by</em> any of these ideologies. They are social facts we have to work with, but not systems of rules we could conform to, even if we wanted to. Besides their extensive contradictions with each other and with obvious realities, they are not specific enough to guide action in concrete situations. They require extensive interpretation in order to become relevant. Yet we cannot choose not to perform that interpretation.</p>
<p>Because gender is patterned, we can never be perfectly free of it—as many second-wave feminists hoped. Because it is nebulous, we can never perfectly embody it—as many religious conservatives hoped. Between these extremes, there is an open space, in which we can take a comfortably playful attitude to choice. We all continually construct gender together; we may as well enjoy making it a collaborative work of art when we can.</p>
<p>Although almost no one maintains a hardcore monist or dualist gender ideology consistently, there’s always a tug toward them, because they simplify thinking. When trying to win an argument, it’s always tempting to say “well, there’s no <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss19" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'real', 'gloss19')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">real</a> difference between men and women, so…”; or “despite shared humanity, men and women have totally distinct proper roles, so…”—and people do say both these things frequently. It would be helpful to accomplish a cultural consensus that we don’t believe these things, so we should stop saying them and acting as though we did.</p>
<p>That would help clarify specific conflicts, because monism and dualism obscure the practicalities. Although some gender issues are important practically, the culture war <a href="#chap39">imposes imaginary additional meanings</a> to co-opt them as ideological battlegrounds, fought from essentialist monist or dualist positions, making them into Giant Referendums On How The Other Tribe Is Wrong About Everything.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_pj78fro" id="extra29_footnoteref4_pj78fro" title="I’ve taken this trope from Scott Alexander’s “Five Case Studies On Politicization.”">4</a> In the 2016 trans bathroom controversy, for instance, this was clearly deliberate: an engineered conflict, designed to increase ideological hostility among voters.</p>
<p>Dropping monism and dualism would still leave plenty of room for disagreements; but they would have to be argued on specific, practical grounds, instead of abstract, metaphysical ones. The complete stance itself answers no practical questions. It leaves open issues such as “what constitutes workplace equality” and “who uses which bathrooms.” However, it points out that these issues don’t have to be so goddamn serious, and that the big-picture ideologies are all quite childish and silly.</p>
<p>Trans issues have come to new prominence in American politics in the past couple of years, with the “TERF wars” and court battles over bathroom use. Trans people are also theoretically interesting for forcing metaphysical questions about gender boundaries: what does it even <em>mean</em> to ask whether they are male or female?</p>
<p>Most people are willing to admit that trans people have some characteristics of both genders, but many also insist that the <dfn>essential</dfn> determinant is one particular characteristic. That’s the “real” one. What makes <em>that</em> one special?</p>
<p>Some dualists<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_2moyck1" id="extra29_footnoteref5_2moyck1" title="Gender essentialists include both some conservative Christians and some radical feminists, who have allied on many sexual deviance issues since the mid-1970s. I have to admit I find this very funny.">5</a> would like to point to some physical characteristic, like maybe the Y chromosome, as essential. But what basis is there for that? The Bible has nothing to say about chromosomes; this can’t be a religious claim. Y chromosomes <em>correlate</em> statistically with penises, social dominance, and various other typically-masculine characteristics. However, there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome">are some people↗︎︎</a> with Y chromosomes whom everyone believes from birth to be female, because there’s no indication—physical or mental—of masculinity, apart from the chromosome itself. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome">vice versa↗︎︎</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_72lohxg" id="extra29_footnoteref6_72lohxg" title="The biochemical mechanisms that typically result in either a “male” or “female phenotype” are extremely complicated and currently not fully understood. There is definitely no single “master factor” that determines maleness or femaleness in humans.">6</a></p>
<p>Some monists would like to say that, since there no differences between men and women other than what is oppressively imposed by culture and society, you are whatever gender you say you are, and everyone must agree and treat you that way. Just as progressives were coming to a consensus on this point, it got complicated by an apparent analogy with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dolezal">Rachel Dolezal↗︎︎</a>, who is trans black. Her career as an NAACP chapter president and university Africana Studies teacher was disrupted when her white parents pointed out that she was born white, with blue eyes and blond hair, and has no black ancestors. She continues to insist that she is <em>really</em> and <em>essentially</em> black because she self-identifies as black, and feels black on the inside.</p>
<p>Some social justice activists agree that she is, indeed, authentically black, and transracial identity is totally valid. Most do not. Many transgender people have written essays arguing that any claimed parallel between transracial and transgender identity is spurious. I’m sympathetic politically, but philosophically I think this is a hard case to make.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_1ftz8im" id="extra29_footnoteref7_1ftz8im" title="All the attempts I read actually argued instead that claiming to be black when you were born apparently white is morally wrong, because you aren’t really black; whereas claiming to be female when you were born apparently male is not morally wrong, because you are really female. This simply assumes by fiat the conclusion it then claims to prove.">7</a></p>
<p>Recognizing that gender can’t simply be wished away, I think it is reasonable to balk at the idea that someone is of a particular sex simply because they say so. On the other hand, recognizing that there is no objective fact about what sex anyone is, I think it is reasonable to agree that anyone who passes as a particular sex might as well be treated as being that sex for most purposes. Further, as far as those who present androgynously or as “none of the above,” we might do well to say “whatever!” and let them get on with it. One is entitled to disapprove of “deviants dressing wrong” privately, if that is your opinion, but eccentric attire is rarely adequate grounds for public censure. (“This nebulosity is not a cosmic problem!”) In all three cases, insisting that there is some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss20" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Ultimate', 'gloss20')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness.

<p>It would help if we could agree that gender is a private matter, thereby restoring part of the public/private boundary that <a href="#extra15">the countercultures destroyed</a>. Although the public/private boundary is necessarily nebulous, other people’s ways of doing gender are mostly none of your business. This is obvious as a criticism of the right, but it applies equally to the left. For example, some leftists are harshly judgemental of women who choose to be supported by their husbands; this is wrong.</p>

Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westphalian_sovereignty">Westphalian model↗︎︎</a> is an epitome of dualism. It holds that there are precisely-defined, permanent borders between states.

Borders were mostly vague and shifting, and while the king’s rule may have been absolute in the capital, his power faded gradually, informally, with distance. The main job of a king was to meddle in the affairs of neighboring kingdoms, which led to wars and/or border adjustments.</p>
<p>The Westphalian system was invented to prevent war.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_n3lidhb" id="extra29_footnoteref9_n3lidhb" title="It takes its name from the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the catastrophic Thirty Years War—Europe’s worst before WWI, with many millions left dead.">9</a> The First World War marked the end of the systematic era, and the beginning of the <a href="#chap153_society">era of crisis and social breakdown</a>. Not only did Westphalian sovereignty fail to prevent the World Wars, it arguably caused them.</p>
<p>The dualistic Cold War profoundly shaped the countercultural era. Opposition to the Vietnam war—a proxy battle of the Cold War—was one of the main drivers of the monist (hippie/student radical) counterculture. The Reagan administration’s anti-Soviet military buildup was one of the main drivers of the dualist counterculture.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg"><div class="youtube_outer_wrapper"><div class="youtube_inner_wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="youtube" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RwUGSYDKUxU?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div></div></figure>
<p>A monist approach would eliminate national boundaries. Wars are between states; without countries and borders between them, there could be no wars. Lennon’s lyrics for “<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html">Imagine↗︎︎</a>” express this view; his last line, “the world will live as one,” is the epitome of monism. I do say he was a dreamer: countries and borders cannot be wished away.</p>
<p>Nor are they ever entirely hard and fast divisions. Many states attempted isolationism in the mid-20th-century, but it is impossible. Only North Korea even pretends now, and it is heavily dependent on China.</p>
<p>Beginning around the end of the countercultural era, which coincided with the end of the Cold War (1991), diplomats and international institutions quietly revised the system of international relations, to reflect the obvious reality that states and borders are patterned but nebulous. The European Union (1992) developed a model for blurred sovereignty, with borders that remain existent but enormously more permeable than previously. The World Trade Organization (1995), and the series of treaties it sponsored, greatly increased both the permeability and complex selectivity of borders. The Rwandan (1994) and Bosnian (1995) genocides changed the minds of many anti-war leftists, and <i>de facto</i> established the principle that the great powers have not only the right but the responsibility to intervene in the internal affairs of sovereign states to prevent humanitarian catastrophes. As dualists had always insisted, bad guys are bad and can’t be wished away; and wars can be fought for noble causes. More recently, failures in the Middle East have convinced many rightists that—as monists had always insisted—many wars cannot be won by military force.</p>
<p>Maybe it counts as success that in the current politics of the developed nations, global trade and immigration have mainly replaced war as the political issues concerned with borders.</p>
<p>This new era of international relations remains a work in progress, and probably always will. It has gotten many details wrong; but the principle that national borders are both nebulous and patterned is significant progress. As with gender, the meanings of national boundaries must be continually renegotiated, and interpreted in specific situations with reference to multiple ideologies. Almost everyone now does accept that national boundaries are both necessary and necessarily permeable. The Westphalian framework lingers as a ritual fiction; or as a subordinated system to which the new <i>de facto</i> non-systematic international relations are meta.</p>
<p>Popular ideologues sometimes talk as if totally open or closed borders were feasible options. And even the more careful pundits often frame the fight as quantitive: a more open border, or a harder one? Such rhetoric appeals to monist and dualist sensibilities, but is unrealistic, unhelpful, and nearly meaningless. Workable answers concern the complex pragmatic specifics of how borders operate. Which people, goods, services, money, and armies are allowed to cross, for what reasons?</p>
<p>Later in <cite>Meaningness and Time</cite>, I will discuss how the subcultural, atomized, and fluid modes regard nation-states.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>The first several pages of this chapter explore subcultural solutions: how subcultures addressed the problems of society, culture, and self that followed from the <a href="#chap167">wreck of counterculturalism</a>. These approaches were, I think, <em>almost right</em>.</p>
<p>However, they were also inadequate, and doomed. The remaining pages explain why the subcultural mode proved unworkable, and inevitably disintegrated into the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomized mode', 'gloss1')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet.

[Click for details.]">fluid mode</a> will need to recover what worked in the subcultural mode, while addressing its flaws and limitations.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_solutions">Subcultural solutions</h2>
<p>Examples provide some intuitive understanding of subcultures: punk, Wicca, goth, anarcha-feminism, SF fandom, straight edge, BDSM, New Romantic.</p>
<p>Subcultures were not just hobbies or musical genres; they were ways of being. They provided the same kinds of life-meaning that the <a href="#chap151">systematic</a> and <a href="#chap155">countercultural</a> modes did—but <em>more</em> so. You were not stuck with the universalist monoculture of a nation; you could choose a subculture that was particularly meaningful for you. Ideally, they combined a distinctive artistic style, religion, politics, ethics, social role, belonging and identity.</p>
<p>Whereas the countercultures:</p>
<ol class="tight_list">
<li>failed to find new foundations for their universalist systems</li>
<li>… and so were revealed as idealistically impractical</li>
<li>failed to address the differences in people’s interests, values, purposes, and needs</li>
<li>failed to provide strong social bonds—only membership in a nation-sized counterculture</li>
<li>failed to transcend their oppositional (<em>counter</em>-cultural) attitude</li>
</ol>
<p>Subcultures, in contrast:</p>
<ol class="tight_list">
<li>felt no need for foundations or justifications, having abandoned universalist claims</li>
<li>made no attempt to solve the Big Problems of nation-sized societies and cultures</li>
<li>affirmed and enhanced the diversity of interests, values, purposes, and needs</li>
<li>provided strong social bonds within human-scale subsocieties of like-minded people</li>
<li>were refuges from social conflict, because subcultures had no reason to oppose each other</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="extra29_failure">Subcultural failure: boundary issues</h2>
<p>Although subcultures still exist, they no longer function as they did during the <dfn>subcultural era</dfn> (1975-2000). It’s mostly no longer possible to rely on one to define your cultural, social, and personal identity.</p>
<p>Each subsociety created a boundary, between its members and the rest of the world. Each subculture also created a boundary: between its meanings and meanings that did not belong. Getting these boundaries right was critical, but difficult.</p>
<p>To function, the boundaries had to be somewhat permeable, but not too permeable. A subsociety needs to allow in a trickle of new members, to replace drop-outs and to allow for manageable growth. If the boundary is too rigid, the group will dwindle and collapse. If the boundary is too vague, members are not sufficiently committed, and also the group can suffer from dilution by mass immigration when its culture becomes popular.</p>
<p>A subculture needs to be somewhat open to new ideas, as a source of creative friction and innovation, but it also needs to maintain sufficient distinctiveness to avoid merging into others.</p>
<p>Subcultures and subsocieties also tended to schism, creating new internal divisions. The resulting, smaller sub-sub-cultures often lacked critical mass: enough talented people to create enough meaning.</p>
<p>The best size for a social group is a few hundred people: big enough to provide reliable support, but small enough that you can find a unique role, valued by all members. The best size for a culture is millions: enough to supply thick meanings for all <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss3')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> of being.</p>
<p>This mismatch meant that either subcultures blew up into mass movements (as the most successful musical genres did) which offered little social support; or, if they remained small, the meanings they could provide were too narrow and too thin.</p>
<p>Finally, there were problems at the interface between the subculture or subsociety and nation-sized institutions such as the state, mainstream religions, and the market economy. Neither side understood the other’s needs, or even acknowledged the others’ legitimacy. States and religions sometimes persecuted subcultures as challenges to their authority; exploitation by the culture industry was often even more destructive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, subcultures did not even try to provide all the functions of large systematic institutions. That made the mode parasitic: a fully subcultural society is not possible, because subcultures and subsocieties cannot do the work of states or large corporations.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_xpmshg4" id="extra29_footnoteref1_xpmshg4" title="In “Archipelago,” I discuss a hypothetical model for how subcultures and nation-sized systems could have coexisted harmoniously, and supported each others’ proper roles. Unfortunately, this potential utopia was not attempted.">1</a></p>
<p>Most subcultures and subsocieties had little awareness of these problems—much less adequate tools to address them. By around the year 2000, however, most people felt intuitively that subculturalism had failed.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_after">After subculturalism</h2>
<p>The <a href="#chap173">atomized mode</a> simply dropped the subculture and subsociety boundaries. Now everyone could access all culture, globally, through the internet. You didn’t have to be a member of a tribe to listen to a particular kind of music. You could take any shard of art and remix it with anything else.</p>
<p>Destroying the tiresome narrowness and shallowness of subculturalism gave an exhilarating sense of freedom. Not only could you take any meaning from anywhere (breadth), you could explore it in unprecedented depth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with boundaries gone, all coherence was lost. In the atomized mode, nothing makes sense. We live now in a world of decaying systematic institutions, facing atomized peoples, with mutual hostility, paranoia, and incomprehension.</p>
<p>The fluid mode, ideally, combines the strengths of all previous modes. Like the systematic mode, it should support nation-sized institutions, to provide necessary social, cultural, and physical infrastructure. Like the countercultural mode, it should support innovative cultural production that is wide, deep, and (like the subcultural mode) diverse. It should support close-knit, voluntary subsocieties of an optimal size. Like the atomized mode, it should allow everyone access to all cultural products.</p>

<p>There have been subcultures for as long as there have been cities. Mainly they were ethnic or sectarian. You were born into them; leaving and joining was difficult; there were only a handful in any place; and their influence on the mainstream culture was small.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, subculturalism exploded outward. The new subcultures were composed mainly of 20-somethings and were chosen freely. They multiplied dizzyingly, and replaced the countercultures as the mode of cultural innovation and production.</p>

<p>I have stolen the term “Archipelago” from a brilliant essay by Scott Alexander, “<a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/">Archipelago and Atomic Communitarianism↗︎︎</a>.” Mostly this page will encourage you to go read that. I’ll also give a bit of a summary, and draw out the connections with subculturalism (which he also made explicit, but not in as much detail).</p>
<p>(The nautical implications of “archipelago” also fit with the sea-of-meaningness trope I have stolen from Will Buckingham’s <cite><a href="https://approachingaro.org/finding-our-sea-legs-will-buckingham-review">Finding Our Sea-Legs↗︎︎</a></cite>, which inspired my description of the “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss1')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance.

<p>The ultra-condensed summary of Archipelago is this. People have radically different opinions about how society should be organized. Probably <em>many</em> of these ideas are right—for different sorts of people. So, ideally, everyone who wants to live in a fundamentalist theocracy can go do that, and everyone who wants to live in a socialist welfare state can go do that, and everyone who wants to live in rationalist capitalist minarchy can go do that. If we had many spare islands, each type of society could set up on a different one, and not step on each others’ toes. We don’t, so there would need to be an overarching governmental structure whose main job was to keep the different systems from interfering with each other.</p>
<p>As Alexander writes, Archipelago “doesn’t look like a practical solution for real problems.” However, “I do think it’s worth becoming more Archipelagian on the margin rather than less so, and that there are good ways to do it.”</p>
<p>I agree. So this page will use the <cite><a href="#chap147">Meaningness and Time</a></cite> framework to analyze the obstacles to Archipelagian developments, and to suggest possible approaches to working around them.</p>
<p>In terms of ideology (rather than practicalities) the principal obstacle is <dfn>universalism</dfn>. That is the idea that meanings must be the same for everyone, everywhere.

<p class="intro_para">Subcultures are dead. I plan to write a full obituary soon.</p>
<p>Subcultures were the main creative cultural force from roughly 1975 to 2000, when they stopped working. Why?</p>
<p>One reason—among several—is that as soon as subcultures start getting really interesting, they get invaded by muggles, who ruin them. Subcultures have a predictable lifecycle, in which popularity causes death. Eventually—around 2000—everyone understood this, and gave up hoping some subculture could somehow escape this dynamic.</p>
<p>(You can read very brief previews of my analysis of subculture dynamics in <a href="#chap149">this table</a> and/or <a href="#chap148">this page</a>.)</p>
<p>The muggles who invade and ruin subcultures come in two distinct flavors, mops and sociopaths, playing very different roles. This insight was influenced by Venkatesh Rao’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F9IV64W/?tag=meaningness-20">Gervais Principle↗︎︎</a>, an analysis of workplace dynamics. Rao’s theory is hideous, insightful <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>; I recommend it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_4ue2d99" id="extra29_footnoteref1_4ue2d99" title="Rao postulates three groups in any organization: the Clueless, the Losers, and the Sociopaths. The Clueless mistakenly believe that the organization is actually supposed to do whatever it pretends to be for: selling widgets, saving endangered herons, or educating school-children, for instance. They are dedicated to this mission and work hard, and creatively, to further it. The Losers have a job because they need a paycheck; their motivation is to make work reasonably pleasant in exchange for minimal effort. The Sociopaths recognize the reality that the organization is just the setting for a power game played among themselves. Nobody really cares about widgets, herons, or other people’s children. The Losers also understand this, but don’t have what it takes to play the game.  In subcultures, Geeks are roughly parallel to the Clueless; they are passionate about whatever the subculture is supposedly about. Mops substitute for Losers: they show up for a reasonably pleasant time in exchange for minimal effort. Sociopaths are Sociopaths. The detailed dynamics are rather different, though; for instance, the Gervais Principle says that organizations begin with Sociopaths and end up with mostly Clueless, whereas subcultures begin with Geeks and end with mostly Mops.">1</a></p>

<h2 id="extra29_birth">The birth of cool</h2>
<p>Before there is a subculture, there is a scene. A <dfn>scene</dfn> is a small group of <dfn>creators</dfn> who invent an exciting New Thing—a musical genre, a religious sect, a film animation technique, a political theory. Riffing off each other, they produce examples and variants, and share them for mutual enjoyment, generating positive energy.</p>
<p>The new scene draws <dfn>fanatics</dfn>. Fanatics don’t create, but they contribute energy (time, money, adulation, organization, analysis) to support the creators.</p>
<p>Creators and fanatics are both <dfn>geeks</dfn>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_6schz04" id="extra29_footnoteref2_6schz04" title="I’m using “geek” here to mean “someone fascinated by the details of a subject most people don’t care about.” There’s another sense of  “geek,” meaning the sort of person you’d expect to find at a science fiction convention. There’s significant overlap, but in the first sense there are gardening geeks and golfing geeks, and most probably aren’t geeks in the second sense. They might create gardening subcultures, though.">2</a> They totally love the New Thing, they’re fascinated with all its esoteric ins and outs, and they spend all available time either doing it or talking about it. </p>
<p>If the scene is sufficiently geeky, it remains a strictly geek thing; a weird hobby, not a subculture.</p>
<p>If the scene is unusually exciting, and the New Thing can be appreciated without having to get utterly geeky about details, it draws <dfn>mops</dfn>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_4qakkre" id="extra29_footnoteref3_4qakkre" title="“MOP” is an abbreviation for “member of the public”; it seems to be fairly common in Britain. My American (mis-)use of it here is probably somewhat non-standard. Other terms that could be used are “casuals” or “tourists.”">3</a> Mops are fans, but not rabid fans like the fanatics. They show up to have a good time, and contribute as little as they reasonably can in exchange.</p>
<p>Geeks welcome mops, at first at least. It’s the mass of mops who turn a scene into a subculture. Creation is always at least partly an act of generosity; creators want as many people to use and enjoy their creations as possible. It’s also good for the ego; it confirms that the New Thing really is exciting, and not just a geek obsession. Further, some money can usually be extracted from mops—just enough, at this stage, that some creators can quit their day jobs and go pro. (Fanatics contribute much more per head than mops, but there are few enough that it’s rarely possible for creatives to go full time with support only from fanatics.) Full-time creators produce more and better of the New Thing.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_mops">The mop invasion</h2>
<p>Fanatics want to share their obsession, and mops initially validate it for them too. However, as mop numbers grow, they become a headache. Fanatics do all the organizational work, initially just on behalf of geeks: out of generosity, and to enjoy a geeky subsociety. They put on events, build websites, tape up publicity fliers, and deal with accountants. Mops just passively soak up the good stuff.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_06ax85y" id="extra29_footnoteref4_06ax85y" title="All the categories here—creators, fanatics, mops, sociopaths—are necessarily nebulous: ambiguous and changing over time. There is no “fact of the matter” about whether someone is an unusually enthusiastic mop, or a fanatic who is less committed than some other fanatics; nor whether someone who creates occasionally but mainly acts to support the subculture counts as a fanatic or creator. Anyone may shift roles, too.">4</a> You may even have to push them around the floor; they have to be led to the drink. At best you can charge them admission or a subscription fee, but they’ll inevitably argue that this is wrong because capitalism is evil, and also because they forgot their wallet.</p>
<p>Mops also dilute the culture. The New Thing, although attractive, is more intense and weird and complicated than mops would prefer. Their favorite songs are the ones that are least the New Thing, and more like other, popular things. Some creators oblige with less radical, friendlier, simpler creations.</p>
<p>Mops relate to each other in “normal” ways, like people do on TV, which the fanatics find repellent. During intermission, geeks want to talk about the New Thing, but mops blather about sportsball and celebrities. Also, the mops also seem increasingly entitled, treating the fanatics as service workers.</p>
<p>Fanatics may be generous, but they signed up to support geeks, not mops. At this point, they may all quit, and the subculture collapses.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_sociopaths">The sociopath invasion</h2>
<p>Unless <dfn>sociopaths</dfn><a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_359nry5" id="extra29_footnoteref5_359nry5" title="I am using “sociopath” here in Rao’s informal sense, not a technical, clinical one.">5</a> show up. A subculture at this stage is ripe for exploitation. The creators generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_capital">cultural capital↗︎︎</a>, i.e. <dfn>cool</dfn>. The fanatics generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital">social capital↗︎︎</a>: a network of relationships—strong ones among the geeks, and weaker but numerous ones with mops. The mops, when properly squeezed, produce liquid capital, i.e. money. None of those groups have any clue about how to extract and manipulate any of those forms of capital.</p>
<p>The sociopaths quickly become best friends with selected creators. They dress <em>just like</em> the creators—only better. They talk <em>just like</em> the creators—only smoother. They may even do some creating—competently, if not creatively. Geeks may not be completely fooled, but they also are clueless about what the sociopaths are up to.</p>
<p>Mops <em>are</em> fooled. They don’t care so much about details, and the sociopaths look to them like creators, only better. Sociopaths become the coolest kids in the room, demoting the creators. At this stage, they take their pick of the best-looking mops to sleep with. They’ve extracted the cultural capital.</p>
<p>The sociopaths also work out how to monetize mops—which the fanatics were never good at. With better publicity materials, the addition of a light show, and new, more crowd-friendly product, admission fees go up tenfold, and mops are willing to pay. Somehow, not much of the money goes to creators. However, more of them do get enough to go full-time, which means there’s more product to sell.</p>
<p>The sociopaths also hire some of the fanatics as actual service workers. They resent it, but at least they too get to work full-time on the New Thing, which they still love, even in the Lite version. The rest of the fanatics get pushed out, or leave in disgust, broken-hearted.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_death">The death of cool—unless…</h2>
<p>After a couple years, the cool is all used up: partly because the New Thing is no longer new, and partly because it was diluted into New Lite, which is inherently uncool. As the mops dwindle, the sociopaths loot whatever value is left, and move on to the next exploit. They leave behind only wreckage: devastated geeks who still have no idea what happened to their wonderful New Thing and the wonderful friendships they formed around it. (Often the geeks all end up hating each other, due first to the stress of supporting mops, and later due to sociopath divide-and-conquer manipulation tactics.)</p>
<p>Unless some of the creators are geniuses. If they can give the New Thing genuine mass appeal, they can ascend into superstardom. The subculture will reorganize around them, into a much more durable form. I won’t go into that in this blog post. I will point out that this almost never happens without sociopaths. An ambitious creator may know they have mass-appeal genius, and <em>could</em> be a star, but very rarely do they know how to get from here to there.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_resistance">Resistance</h2>
<p>So what is to be done?</p>
<p>This is a geek question. The subculture lifecycle is a problem only from a geek perspective. As far as mops are concerned, it provides reliable, low-cost waves of novelty entertainment and casual social relationships. As far as psychopaths are concerned, it generates easily-exploited pools of prestige, sex, power, and money.</p>
<p>From a utilitarian point of view, mops hugely outnumber geeks, so in terms of total social value, it’s all good. Can’t make omelettes without breaking some eggheads.</p>
<p>So what is to be done?</p>
<p>Geeks can refuse to admit mops. In fact, successful subcultures always do create costly barriers to entry, to keep out the uncommitted.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_t1zlp0n" id="extra29_footnoteref6_t1zlp0n" title="I’ll discuss these barriers more extensively in upcoming writing.">6</a> In the heyday of subcultures, those were called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseur">poseurs↗︎︎</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_tts9ga5" id="extra29_footnoteref7_tts9ga5" title="“Poseur” was perhaps directed even more at sociopaths than mops, but didn’t clearly distinguish between the two.">7</a> Mop exclusion keeps the subculture comfortable for geeks, but severely limits its potential. Often there’s a struggle between geeks who like their cozy little club as it is, and geeks who want a shot at greatness—for themselves, or the group, or the New Thing. In any case, subculture boundaries are always porous, and if the New Thing is cool enough, mops will get in regardless.</p>
<p>The optimal mop:geek ratio is maybe 6:1. At that ratio, the mops provide more energy than they consume. A ratio above about 10:1 becomes unworkable; it’s a recipe for burnout among supporting fanatics. Ideally, the ratio could be controlled. I think few subcultures understand this imperative, and I’m not sure how it could be done even if one did understand. Mops move in herds. Usually either there are only a few, or their numbers quickly grow too large.</p>
<p>Sociopaths only show up if there’s enough mops to exploit, so excluding (or limiting) mops is a strategy for excluding sociopaths. Some subcultures do understand this, and succeed with it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could recognize sociopaths and eject them. Geeks may be pretty good at the recognizing, but are lousy at the ejecting. Mops don’t recognize sociopaths, and anyway don’t care. Mops have little investment in the subculture, and can just walk away when sociopaths ruin it. By the time sociopaths show up, mops are numerically most of the subculture. Sociopaths manipulate the mops, and it’s hard for the geeks to overrule an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>Anyway, horribly, geeks <em>need</em> sociopaths—if the New Thing is ever going to be more than a geeky hobby, or a brief fad that collapses under the weight of the mop invasion.</p>
<p>So what is to be done?</p>
<h2 id="extra29_evil">Be slightly evil</h2>
<p>The subcultural mode mostly ended around 2000. There still are subcultures, new ones all the time, but they no longer have the cultural and social force they used to. The “classical model” of subcultures no longer works, for the reasons given here, plus others I’ll describe in upcoming writing. I don’t think it can be rescued.</p>
<p>However, the <dfn>fluid mode</dfn>—my hoped-for future—resembles the subcultural mode in many ways. The same social dynamics may play out, unless there is a powerful antidote.</p>
<p>A slogan of Rao’s may point the way: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8JTYH8/?tag=meaningness-20">Be slightly evil↗︎︎</a>. Or: geeks need to learn and use some of the sociopaths’ tricks. Then geeks can capture more of the value they create (and get better at ejecting true sociopaths).</p>
<p>Specific strategies for sociopathy are outside the scope of this book. However, I have an abstract suggestion.</p>
<p>Rao concludes his analysis by explaining that his “sociopaths” are actually <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilists', 'gloss2')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

Serious subcultures are usually <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss3')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalistic</a>: the New Thing is a source of meaning that gives everything in life purpose. Eternalistic <a href="#chap46">naïveté</a> makes subcultures much easier to exploit.</p>
<p>“Slightly evil” defense of a subculture requires realism: letting go of eternalist <a href="#chap42">hope</a> and <a href="#chap48">faith</a> in imaginary <a href="#chap32">guarantees</a> that the New Thing will triumph. Such realism is characteristic of nihilism. Nihilism has its own delusions, though. It <em>is</em> worth trying to create beautiful, useful New Things—and worth defending them against nihilism. A fully realistic worldview corrects both eternalistic and nihilistic errors.</p>
<p>Combining what works in eternalism and nihilism amounts to the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss4')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

<p>In our present, <dfn>atomized</dfn> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'mode of meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“How meaning fell apart” suggests a series of modes of relating to meaningness. In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.) As systematic justifications break down, the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes are successive attempts to relate to the fragmentation of meaning. Finally, the fluid mode synthesizes the functional aspects of all the previous ones. [Click for details.]">mode of meaningness</a>, cultures, societies, and selves cannot hold together. They shatter into tiny jagged shards. We shake the broken bits together, in senseless kaleidoscopic, hypnotic reconfigurations, with no context or coherence.</p>

<p>This may sound like a problem. Overall, my description of the atomized mode may sound like a panicked condemnation.

Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

[Click for details.]">subcultural</a> mode failed because individual subcultures did not provide enough breadth or depth of meaning; and because cliquish subsocieties made it too difficult to access the narrow meaningness they hoarded.</p>
<p>The global internet exploded that. Everything is equally available everywhere—which is fabulous! Now, there are no boundaries, so bits of culture float free. Unfortunately, with no binding contexts, nothing makes sense. Meanings arrive as bite-sized morsels in a jumbled stream, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>With no urge for context to make culture understandable, everything is equally appealing everywhere. The atomized mode returns to the <dfn>universalism</dfn> of the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'countercultural mode', 'gloss3')" title="The countercultural mode of relating to meaningness attempts to develop a new, alternative, universalist, eternalist, anti-rational system for society, culture, and self, that is meant to replace the mainstream.

Its genre is, in fact, K-pop; but may be the only K-pop song most Westerners have ever heard.</p>
<p>Genre—which defined many subcultures—has disintegrated. Atomization seemed at first like subculturalism taken to an extreme, but it is a qualitatively new mode. K-pop may be a subculture in Korea, but in America it’s just YouTube. It’s normal for a Top 40 hit to mash up country-style pedal steel guitar with bubble-gum-pop vocals, hip-hop rapping, EDM bass, and black metal blast beats. “Authenticity”—the aesthetic ideal of subculturalism—is impossible because there are no standards to be authentic to.</p>
<p>In atomized culture, intensity—shock, novelty, extremes—substitutes for structure. There are no systematic principles for comparing value, so immediate emotional appeal trumps formal qualities. The <i>avant garde</i> has finally expired as an irrelevant archaism. <a href="#chap153_culture">Duchamp</a> couldn’t out-irreverence or out-peculiar Psy.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_society">Atomized society</h2>
<p>In atomization, the subcultural mode’s local communities cannot hold together, because they no longer deliver adequate meaning. The subcultural solution to the problems of self and society—intermediate-scale subsocieties that buffer individuals from national institutions—failed.</p>
<p>Instead, society moves onto global interactive media. Internet social networks support larger, geographically dispersed virtual communities. You no longer need to be in the happening place to get access to a genre or scene. You may not know the gender, race, or nationality of some of your closest friends. It is wonderful to find people who share your nearly-unique interests—but can online relationships replace in-person ones? Can electronic communities provide the same benefits as local ones?</p>
<p>The vestiges of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systematic mode', 'gloss4')" title="The systematic mode attempts to justify all meanings with some explanatory structure.

As culture and society atomize, it becomes impossible to maintain a coherent ideology. Religions decohere into vague “spirituality,” and political isms give way to bizarre, transient, reality-impaired online movements. Decontextualized, contradictory, intensely-proclaimed religious and political “beliefs” displace legacy systems of meaning. These are not beliefs in an ordinary sense, but <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/">advertisements↗︎︎</a> of personal qualities and tribal identification. The atomized mode generates paranoia, because without the systematic mode’s “therefores,” its <dfn>structure of justification</dfn>, there are no memetic defenses against bad ideas.</p>
<p>Atomized politics abandons the outdated convention that political arguments should make sense. Occupy, the Tea Party, ISIS, the “tumblr SJW” and “alt-right” social media movements, and the 2016 American Presidential campaign ignored “therefore” in favor of claims that were false and absurd, but not duplicitous, because they were not intended to be believed—just reacted to for their intense emotional impact.</p>
<p>Legacy systematic institutions—especially states—find themselves increasingly unable to cope with the rate of change, or to adapt to an environment of pervasive incoherence. This leaves cracking systems of government facing atomized populations, mutually uncomprehending because of their different modes of processing meaning, producing increasingly intense paranoia on both sides. States are starting to fail, as parts of the world become ungovernable. Others are abandoning democracy for authoritarianism, in desperate attempts to hold social structures together.</p>

<p>We build selves by internalizing meanings from our culture and from social relationships. As culture and society atomize, we are bombarded with a kaleidoscopic chaos of brightly-colored atoms of meaning, and it becomes impossible to construct or maintain a coherent self.</p>

This is impossible in the atomized mode.</p>
<p>The always-on internet delivers massively more interruptions, entertainments, relationships, and chores than humans evolved for. Even a relational, “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">stage 3↗︎︎</a>” self is atomized into a turbulent stream of interaction, because relationships are electronically mediated.</p>
<p>“Authenticity” of self, like authenticity of culture, becomes meaningless when there is no “thine own” to be true to. When it’s obviously impossible to form a systematic self, the task is to surf your own incoherence. Increasingly, this is a practical problem, not an existential threat. We are gradually building skill at it—and this points toward the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss9')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance.

[Click for details.]">patterns</a> within it.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_problems">Pathologies of atomization: the new problems of meaningness</h2>
<p>In the countercultural mode, as mainstream meanings imploded, finding new foundations for meaning seemed the most urgent problem of meaning. We’ve long since abandoned that quest. The problems we face now are quite different. I will devote <a href="/new-problems">a full page↗︎︎</a> to them later, and have mentioned some above.</p>
<p>Overall, the problem is that without structures and boundaries, shards of meaning do not relate to each other, so it’s impossible to compare them. There is no standard of value, so everything seems equally trivial—or equally earth-shaking, or equally threatening. Our lives are so full of so many tiny tasty things, and so many crises and outrages, that it may all fail to add up to much.</p>
<p>The loss of coherence, of “therefore,” gives a misimpression of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss11')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>, of meaninglessness. In the atomized mode, though, there’s <em>overwhelming</em> quantities of meaning. We suffer from FOMO,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_hkg6zg5" id="extra29_footnoteref2_hkg6zg5" title="Fear Of Missing Out.">2</a> browser tab explosions, and Facebook trance. Projects, creativity, and fundamental values suffer when they are challenged by cacophonous internet alerts a million times a day.</p>
<p>Meanings no longer fit together to point anywhere. This resembles the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'choiceless', 'gloss12')" title="In the choiceless mode, you are unaware of differences of opinion concerning meaningness. You take meanings for granted, without asking “why” questions. It could also be called the communal mode or “tradition.” [Click for details.]">choiceless</a> (“traditional”) mode, which also feels no need for grand unified schemes that make everything make sense. In both modes, incoherence—the lack of large-scale structures of meaning—does not particularly seem a problem. We can navigate locally anyway.</p>
<p>The difference is that we now need to manage hugely more complexity, diversity, volume, and urgency of meanings. Individuals can get by in the atomized world without coherent understanding. Societies cannot.</p>
<p>Civilization still needs large systematic institutions—states, corporations, markets, universities—to survive. The atomized mode corrodes the social systems we depend on. Some are nearing collapse. I do not know whether people who grew up in that mode, and disdain systematicity, can keep the machinery of civilization running.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_after">After the atomized mode</h2>
<p>The atomized mode is actually impossible. No one is entirely incapable of understanding “therefore,” of coordinating meanings, or ranking values. As I explained at the beginning of <a href="#chap148">this history of meaningness</a>, all the modes are merely “<a href="#chap148">ideal types</a>”: simplified extremes that cannot exist in the real world.</p>
<p>In reality, we have always been in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss9')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance.

<p>We have always been in the fluid mode, but now at last we are in a position to recognize it. Now, at last, we have the cultural, social, and psychological resources we need to get good at it. Atomization supplies the critical realization that perfect coherence is neither necessary nor even desirable. Fluidity builds on that, to re-form systems as relative tools rather than eternal absolutes.</p>

<p>I wrote the following in January, 2014, as a casual rant, and posted it in a private forum. It alluded to ideas about atomization that I only began publishing here in 2016. Now, in early 2017, those may seem obvious features of your Facebook feed—rather than recondite theories which I developed, haltingly, years ago. As I am still making slow progress in polishing text for publication: here is the rant.</p>
<p><em>Raw</em>. Perhaps the style suits the subject...</p>
<div class="separator"><img alt="text separator" height="11" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/footnote_separator.gif" width="416"/></div>
<p>My girlfriend asked me over dinner: “So, where is the most exciting thinking happening now?”</p>
<p>That was a puzzler. After I stalled by saying “In my head, mostly,” and we traded various jokes about arrogance and narcissism, I had to admit that I couldn’t think of any. (We had both drunk rather a lot of sake, which is still affecting me, or I wouldn’t post something like this.)</p>
<p>“Maybe this isn’t a good time for thinking,” I said.</p>
<p>Which seemed accurate to her; but we agreed it was odd.</p>
<p>There are, of course, good and bad places and times for thinking. Athens in 450 BC was a famously good time. England in 700 CE was not.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Project was a good place and time to think—about atomic bombs, at least.</p>
<p>I was at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab through the 1980s. It was self-consciously similar to the Manhattan Project. Public expectations for AI were at an all-time high.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_dnak1gx" id="extra29_footnoteref1_dnak1gx" title="Since I wrote this, the late-eighties AI hype wave has been surpassed by a new late-twenty-teens AI hype wave.">1</a> We had unlimited funding from the Department of Defense. The lab selected ferociously smart students and staff. (In 1982, there were 2000 applicants for each available position as a graduate student.) Human-level computer intelligence was just around the corner.</p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>That was a failed Manhattan Project. We had brilliant, fascinating, innovative theories, all of which were utterly wrong. It <em>seemed</em> like a fabulous place to think, but the intellectual culture was subtly broken, and we were all fooling ourselves.</p>
<p>Still, the 1980s overall were an exciting time. Molecular biology was taking off. My best friend was doing something important with molecular genetics at Harvard. (I can’t remember what.) I did a bunch of graduate-level coursework in that stuff, ’cuz it was so cool.</p>
<p>Also, the whole French post-structuralist thing was happening, which (like AI) was mostly flashy theories about nothing, but it felt like fireworks at the time.</p>
<p>So mostly that was a failure, but molecular biology was real. On the other hand… biology turned into “normal science” (i.e. routine crank-turning). Hard to be excited about it now.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_ejg9axa" id="extra29_footnoteref2_ejg9axa" title="I wrote this shortly before I learned about CRISPR, which may end old age, sickness, and death. That could be quite interesting.">2</a></p>
<p>So what was the last exciting thing to happen in the world of ideas? Evopsych was exciting for about six months ten or fifteen years ago. But once you’d got your head around its few key ideas, the rest was obvious deductions. Verifying the details has become normal science again.</p>
<p>Some of us here are thirsty for “insight porn”… and there’s little to be had. Maybe it’s only sold under the counter and I’m too naive to find it. Or maybe I’m old and jaded; or my brain has rotted and I wouldn’t recognize an insight if it bit me in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>“So if you went back to MIT, would you find no interesting conversations there?” my girlfriend asked.</p>
<p>I don’t know—I haven’t hung around a university in twenty years. But I figure if anything was happening—other than normal science—I’d hear about it eventually. And I ain’t hearing <em>nothin’</em>.</p>
<p>So maybe you will humor me (since I’m drunk) and will allow, for the sake of the argument, that this is not a good decade for thinking.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Well, <em>I have a theory</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a weak inference from <a href="#chap148">a broader story</a> about what is happening in our general global culture. I really truly intend to write that up properly Any Day Now.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_tfpj15q" id="extra29_footnoteref3_tfpj15q" title="Hold your breath! Definitely. Any day now.">3</a></p>
<p>The theory starts from the fact that we are in the <em><a href="#chap153">post-systems era</a></em>. That isn’t my idea, it’s standard-issue 1980s French stuff—one of the few things they actually got right.</p>
<p>The problem is, mostly the only model we have for <em>scarily smart people</em> to express insights is to build conceptual systems. But those don’t work no more.</p>
<p>The not-really-all-that-smart people haven’t noticed that yet, and are still building systems, which is lame. (We can roll our eyes at anyone who comes up with a conceptual system. Nothing needs to actually be <em>said</em>, because that’s just <em>so</em> 20th century.)</p>
<p>So what do the <em>scarily smart people</em> do? They trade absurdly erudite jokes about nothing on twitter and complain about the scarcity of insight porn. (Not mentioning any <em>names</em> here. You know who you are.)</p>
<p><em>Then</em> what?</p>
<p>Well, according to my theory (which looks distressingly like a conceptual system…) the next stage in cultural evolution is <em><a href="#chap175">disposable assemblages</a></em>.

[Click for details.]">patterns</a>, which is obviously impossible. So tacitly we all understand that meaning must be <em>both nebulous and patterned</em>—and this is exactly the complete stance. “The fluid mode” consists of working out what that may mean for society, culture, and self.</p>
<p>The fluid mode goes meta on the previous modes. That is, it understands meaning as a dynamic process of evolution through social, cultural, and psychological change. It recognizes all the problems that the previous modes tried to solve, synthesizes what was right in each attempt. It also abandons what was wrong in each.</p>
<p>The <a href="#chap155">countercultures</a> wrongly <a href="#chap160">rejected rationality</a>, because the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systematic mode', 'gloss6')" title="The systematic mode attempts to justify all meanings with some explanatory structure.

The <a href="#chap169">subcultures</a> rejected universalism—rightly, but absolutely, which made nation-scale structures impossible. <a href="#chap173">Atomization</a> made coherence impossible, which could become disastrous. During the eras of these three modes, rational, large-scale, coherent systems became increasingly inconceivable—but without them, civilization is impossible.</p>
<p>The fluid mode must reinstate rationality, universality, and coherence, but with recognition of their nebulosity. In fluidity, systems are relativized, not eliminated.</p>
<p>The fluid mode follows the atomized one. Atomization’s great contribution is an instinctive appreciation of nebulosity. At an intuitive, kinesthetic level, we have all become much more comfortable with ambiguity, chaos, uncertainty, and volatility. What’s missing is an understanding of how pattern arises:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>impermanently</li>
<li>creatively</li>
<li>biologically</li>
<li>collaboratively</li>
<li>spontaneously</li>
<li>in dependence on the non-human realm</li>
</ul>
<p>Atomization bears new problems of meaningness: the overwhelming torrent of meaning spewed by the internet; its triviality, causing distraction from value judgements; and perceived tensions between internet and “real life.”</p>
<p>Atomization is a fact; it can’t be reversed. The question to ask is “how can we live enjoyably and effectively in a world in which society, culture, and self <em>are</em> atomized?” Part of the answer is: by constructing temporary assemblages of greater meaning—while recognizing that they can’t be <em>answers</em> or <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal', 'gloss7')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

<p>Because systems emerge in particular social, cultural, and psychological circumstances, metasystematicity requires a historical perspective: an understanding of how meaningness develops through time. That was the aim of <cite><a href="#chap148">How meaning fell apart</a></cite>.</p>
<p>Here I ask: which aspects of these previous modes of meaningness are worth rescuing from historical oblivion, and how must they be transformed to function effectively as the future comes into focus?</p>
<h2 id="extra29_overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We can understand the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes as attempts to address the defects of the systematic mode, and to restore lost benefits of choicelessness. They successively rejected three of systems’ key principles: <dfn>rationality</dfn>, <dfn>universality</dfn>, and <dfn>coherence</dfn>. These principles contribute to the oppressive rigidity of the systematic mode, because it takes them as eternalistic absolutes. Jettisoning them brought significant benefits. Unfortunately, each anti-systematic move was also, in part, regressive: walking back in longing for the choiceless mode.</p>
<p>Rationality, universality, and coherence contribute to systems’ beneficial functioning. Since <a href="#chap153">the breakdown</a> of the systematic mode, rational, large-scale, coherent systems have become increasingly inconceivable. Unfortunately, without them, civilization is impossible. A collapse of our legacy systems, under assault from anti-rational, anti-universal, anti-coherent myopia, would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The fluid mode must restore all three principles, but in relativized forms that recognize their inseparable nebulosity and pattern. This requires a better understanding of the nature of meaningness—which I hope <cite><a href="/">Meaningness</a></cite>, the book, supplies.</p>
<p>This page suggests that the fluid mode should:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li><dfn>Simulate choiceless community</dfn>, providing social and cultural structures that allow us to live <em>as if</em> in a close-knit traditional tribe, but with the benefits of a postindustrial civilization.</li>
<li><dfn>Relativize systems</dfn>, restoring respect for their aesthetic elegance and practical effectiveness, while dispelling their <a href="#chap32">foundational certainties</a> so they can accommodate alternatives.</li>
<li><dfn>Enjoy mass-culture creativity</dfn>, as in the countercultures: appreciating their optimistic visions, their motivating drive, and their thickness and breadth of meaning.</li>
<li><dfn>Rework subsociety boundaries</dfn>, so they provide diverse communities for diverse people, without parasitizing larger-scale cultural and social structures.</li>
<li><dfn>Embrace atomization</dfn>, the technology-driven force that makes nebulosity inescapably obvious, and develop better cultural, social, and psychological tools for finding sense within it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are desiderata: mere hopes and wishes. <cite><a href="#chap178">Sailing the seas of meaningness</a></cite> explains <em>how</em> the fluid mode may work. It is not structured in terms of previous modes of meaningness—although it takes them as background. This page extracts principles from the history, so we will rarely require further reference to it.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_choicelessness">Simulate choiceless community</h2>
<p>Nearly all humans have had a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. We lived in wandering clans, of a dozen to a few score, which were parts of wider tribes of a few hundreds or thousands. Some anthropologists say we spent about four hours a day working, which was enough to meet all material needs. Everyone’s work was recognized as meaningful and valuable by everyone else. Most of the rest of the time was spent in enjoyable cultural and social activities. Band membership was elective (chosen): if you didn’t get along with one, you could usually join another.</p>
<p>This sounds like a good deal to me! It seems that such a highly-meaningful, socially supportive, leisure-filled life would <em>feel right</em>, because our brains evolved for it.</p>
<p>It is a utopian fantasy, though, unless we also admit the nasty, brutish, and short aspects of hunter-gatherer life. Not just the material poverty, but the social and cultural narrowness: like being stuck with your middle-school clique, listening to the same twenty dumb songs, for your entire life. Having choices is usually good. Personal <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">development beyond communal values↗︎︎</a>, into more sophisticated ways of being, is good for those who can manage it.</p>
<p>Can’t we have the benefits without the limitations? Especially, can’t we get the benefits of both the choiceless (traditional, communal, premodern) and systematic (bureaucratic, rational, modern) modes?</p>
<p>Cultures and societies may function well just to the extent that they manage that. We can’t go back to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, even if we wanted to. But we can provide substitutes for its key features, or “simulations” that give similar benefits. In fact, every subsequent mode has worked partly by doing that:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>The systematic mode <a href="#chap151_eternalism">substituted eternalistic certainty</a> for choicelessness, and prescribed definite social roles for everyone</li>
<li>The countercultures <a href="#chap159">affirmed humanistic, communal values</a> against the <a href="#chap153_self">dehumanizing, individualizing machinery</a> of systematicity</li>
<li>Elective, “neo-tribal” <a href="/subsocieties">subsocieties↗︎︎</a> provided social support and “DIY” participatory culture; many members dropped out of systematic society, and found ways to live without employment</li>
<li>Internet social networks can enable close elective bonds, and exciting participatory culture, in the atomized era.</li>
</ul>
<p>The countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes can all be seen as attempts to compromise between the choiceless and systematic modes, or to combine their benefits. Why is this so urgently necessary?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674445880/?tag=meaningness-20">In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life↗︎︎</a>, by the developmental psychologist Robert Kegan, suggests an answer. To make sense of life within systematic society, you have to build a <a href="#chap151_self">systematic self</a>. Otherwise, the expectations of modern institutions seem arbitrary, selfish, cruel, and deranged. Unfortunately, empirical studies find that only a minority of people in modern societies manage to create such selves. The majority are, in Kegan’s words, “developmentally traditional people in a modern world.” Friction from this mismatch causes great stress, especially in work life and in dealing with state institutions.</p>
<p>Society should work for as many people as possible. It certainly should work for the majority—who are not currently capable of coping with systematicity. That would mean they could live “as if” in the choiceless mode.</p>
<p id="extra29_DDS">I hope the fluid mode will create a <dfn>deliberately developmental society</dfn>, based on a recognition that people vary in capacity. Ideally:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Societies and cultures should provide the <em>feelings</em> of belonging, security, and coherent, shared meanings we found in hunter-gatherer bands.</li>
<li>They should make material abundance available to all, with relatively little effort, with no requirement to conform to elaborate systematic demands.</li>
<li>There should be a clearly-marked <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">path for personal development↗︎︎</a> beyond the communal mode. It should encourage and reward those who pursue it—but not penalize or denigrate those who can’t, or choose not to.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a tall order. Fulfilling it completely is not feasible with our current material technology and economy, nor with available social and cultural “technologies.” However, that is not required for the initial transition to the fluid mode. It’s a longer-term goal. Each previous mode’s way of simulating choicelessness also depended on innovations in technology, economics, social organization, and culture, so this is nothing new.</p>
<p>Although progress is never guaranteed, virtually unlimited material abundance seems plausible in a few decades. That would enable new economic arrangements, such as a “guaranteed basic income,” for example. That would have social and cultural consequences that we can only speculate about—but which it would be good to start preparing for.</p>
<p>An immediate transition to abundance might result in a catastrophic crisis of meaning: what would everyone do all day? In the absence of close community and participatory culture, perhaps most people would spend their time watching TV, and experiencing the <a href="#chap84">symptoms of nihilism</a>—depression, rage, and anxiety—because life without imposed structure seems meaningless.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_systems">Relativize systems</h2>
<p>The systematic mode asked: how can we do things better? And its answer was: by building knowledge up from rational foundations. That led to Renaissance art, the scientific revolution, constitutional democracy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIFNEddeZI4">internet cat videos↗︎︎</a>, and most everything else that makes life better for us than for subsistence farmers.</p>
<p>Although rationalist epistemology worked astonishingly well for centuries, it is not actually correct. Nebulosity is unavoidable, and ultimate foundations are impossible. Attempts to force nebulous reality to fit rigid systems <a href="#chap153">inevitably fail</a>. And before failing, they result in <a href="#chap153_self_problems">alienation, anomie</a>, <a href="#chap153_totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, <a href="#chap153_existentialism">existentialism</a>, and other such evils.</p>
<p>These problems led the three following modes to abandon the three epistemological principles of rationality, universality, and coherence. Accordingly, the countercultures proposed unrealistic reforms to soften systematicity; the subcultures carved parts of life away from the systematic matrix, but remained parasitic on it; and the atomized mode is simply oblivious to it.</p>
<p>Those developments were mainly steps backward, although the post-systematic modes were right that rationality had failed. Despite that, the systematic mode’s epistemology is more sophisticated than both those of the choiceless mode and those of the post-systematic modes. Rationality powers its elegance and effectiveness.</p>
<p>As with the choiceless mode, we should ask: How do we get the benefits of systematicity without the costs?</p>
<p>I will suggest this is possible, in the fluid mode, by adopting a <dfn>meta-rational</dfn> epistemology. Meta-rationality retains the virtues of systematic rationality, but also incorporates an understanding of nebulosity and pattern. Abandoning the <a href="#chap32">futile quest</a> for absolute foundations, it enables forms of flexibility the systematic mode lacked. It allows multiple interpenetrating systems to co-exist, without demanding that all apparent conflicts be resolved in favor of one or another. Meta-rationality treats rationality, universality, and coherence as often-valuable tools, not as cosmic absolutes.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality is cognitively challenging:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Developmentally traditional people in the modern world” are not competent in systematic rationality. They cannot <em>understand</em> the question “how can we get the benefits of systematicity without the costs”—because they are blind to its beneficial operation. As far as they are concerned, safe drinking water, impartial courts, and cat videos might as well rain from heaven.</li>
<li>Those who have progressed to a systematic worldview, but no further, cannot believe the question has an answer, because they cannot imagine the possibility of anything better. The only alternatives appear to be a return to communal irrationality, or a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss16" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilistic', 'gloss16')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilistic</a> breakdown. This makes them willfully blind to systematicity’s costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a meta-systematic society and culture, when few people can follow meta-rational explanations, will be difficult. Nevertheless, I will suggest ways it may be possible. I will also suggest ways of making meta-rational understanding more broadly available. A clearly-marked path from personal systematicity to meta-systematicity is a further requirement for a deliberately developmental society.</p>
<p>In a sense, that is the project of <cite>Meaningness</cite> overall! But I will make more specific pedagogical proposals as well.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_mass">Enjoy the creativity and vision of mass culture</h2>
<p>The systematic mode had an attractively optimistic vision: that we could do everything right, which would solve all problems. This vision was discredited by the <a href="#chap153">endless catastrophes and breakdowns</a> of the first half of the Twentieth Century.</p>
<p>The countercultures provided alternative optimistic visions. Those enabled a wave of delightful cultural creativity. Their universalism implied that “we, nationally or globally, are all in this together.” That gave them the critical mass of innovators needed to develop a panoply of new <a href="#chap165">thick and wide</a> meanings, attractive to tens or hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the universalism of the countercultures meant that <a href="#chap166">their social reforms failed</a>. People differ, and need different social, cultural, and personal arrangements. The fluid mode must recognize that. The countercultures’ <a href="#chap160">anti-rationality</a> also resulted in failure: their alternative, optimistic visions were wildly unrealistic.</p>
<p>Unlike the countercultures, the two subsequent modes have been unable to provide thick, broad, and positive culture. The essence of subculturalism was the rejection of mass-scale culture—which allowed creative diversity, but usually <a href="/subcultures-thin-narrow">failed to achieve the scale↗︎︎</a> needed to provide sufficient thickness and breadth of meaning. The atomized mode does resemble the countercultural mode in producing culture with global appeal, but its incoherence results in triviality, whereas the countercultures’ depth of meaning grew from coherent visions.</p>
<p>The subcultural and atomized modes also lost the countercultures’ optimism, and often slid into <a href="#chap82">Lite Nihilism</a>. As of 2017, most people in developed societies expect the future to be pretty much the same as the present, except worse. The possibility of a positive vision is met with derisive cynicism. This is understandable, as due to the collapse of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss10')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalism</a>, which had underwritten the belief in progress. But it is unfortunate and unprecedented.</p>
<p>How can we engender optimistic cultural creativity, like that of the countercultures—without <a href="#chap160">their anti-rational idiocy</a>, <a href="#chap167">destructive antagonism</a>, and <a href="#extra15">totalitarian universalism</a>?</p>
<p>In the fluid mode, this requires:</p>
<ol class="tight_list">
<li>Recovering a relativized rationality.</li>
<li>Adopting the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss7')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

<li>Recognizing the nebulosity and pattern of both universalism and particularism. I’ll sketch that in the next section of this page.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for the first point: meta-rationality is the antidote to countercultural anti-rationality, as well as to systematic <a href="#chap63">rationalist eternalism</a>. Two partly-correct observations motivate anti-rationalism: that rationalism implies oppressive systematic rigidity, and that it implies nihilism.</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>By recognizing the nebulosity of meaningness, meta-rationality loosens up absolutist, rationalist systems.</li>
<li>By recognizing the patterning of meaningness, meta-rationality refutes and dispels nihilism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fluid social institutions and culture can grow from this understanding.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_boundaries">Rework subsociety boundaries</h2>
<p>The subcultural mode abandoned universality, in favor of rigorous particularism. Different subcultures provided different bodies of meaning, suitable for different sorts of people. Finding the right subculture let you “be yourself.” Finding the right subsociety gave you a feeling of “coming home to my own people, at last.” This new mode provided a much better—nearly <em>customized</em>—self/society fit than the systematic and countercultural ones could.</p>
<p>Not needing to justify any universal claims, subcultures no longer had a use for any eternal rock of certainty. They maintained coherence thematically, with aesthetic judgements and with ritual, rather than with a foundational structure of justifications. This put them on track toward the complete stance: <a href="#chap3">neither eternalist nor nihilist</a>. Many subcultures did abandon eternalism—tacitly, at least—and most avoided nihilism.</p>
<p>Freed from pompous eternalism and dour nihilism, subcultures became explicitly play. Steampunk is deliberately ridiculous, and not <em>meant</em> to be taken seriously. But it is also not trivial genre entertainment, as it may appear to outsiders. The subcultures began to explore the possibility that seriousness and playfulness are not mutually exclusive. That inseparability should be a major, explicit aspect of the fluid mode.</p>
<p>Subculturalism enabled a new kind of creativity. Punks called it “DIY” (do it yourself): they rejected the resources of the culture industry, to escape its exploitative power. But “yourself” was an individualist self-<wbr/>misunderstanding. The tacit realization was that <em>we make meaning together</em>, as a subsociety, or “scene.” The meanings we make are meant <em>just for us</em>.</p>
<p>Functional communities range from dozens to thousands of people. When a subculture gained an audience of millions, the subsocieties that produced it exploded in size, <a href="#chap172">became dysfunctional</a>, and disintegrated.</p>
<p>Recognizing the problem, subsocieties found ways to limit membership. One strategy was to avoid mass appeal by making the subculture increasingly esoteric and repellent to outsiders. Eventually, the mode failed because the cultures it produced became ever narrower, shallower, and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>At their best, subsocieties and subcultures were refuges from the screeching chaotic dysfunction of nation-scale systematic social institutions and the nation-scale culture war. Particularism allowed members to deny responsibility for anything outside their subculture. Most did their best to simply ignore all that and enjoyed playing in their sandbox. This made the mode parasitic: keeping civilization running was <em>someone else’s</em> problem. Society as a whole cannot take this attitude. Meanwhile, nation-scale social institutions often regarded subcultures as threats, and attempted to destroy them, sometimes successfully. Nation-scale economic institutions often saw subcultures as opportunities for exploitation, which also destroyed some.</p>
<p>The <a href="#chap166">failure of the countercultures</a> showed that universalism, as an absolute, cannot work. However, the particularism of the subcultural mode also did not work as an absolute:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Rejecting mass culture as inherently rubbish was a mistake</li>
<li>We need effective nation-scale social institutions</li>
<li>The attitude that subsociety membership makes you <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss20" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'special', 'gloss20')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.  This is not actually possible. [Click for details.]">special</a> was psychologically harmful</li>
</ul>
<p>The fluid mode must relativize both universalism and particularism:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Sameness and difference are not absolute; they shade into each other</li>
<li>Any two people, or two groups, are similar in some ways and dissimilar in others</li>
<li>Some principles apply almost universally; others make sense only for some people</li>
<li>Therefore, social institutions must address different issues at different scales</li>
<li>Because subsocieties are elective, many coexist in a single city. Organizing government structures geographically no longer maps social differences; we need an alternative</li>
</ul>
<p>Supportive subsocieties were a great accomplishment of the subcultural era. I hope the fluid mode can create something similar. That will require explicitly reworking the relationship between subsocieties and larger groups. Both sides must understand and respect the needs of the other. Subsocieties must acknowledge their dependence on the effective functioning of states and economies, and must contribute to them. States and economies must acknowledge the worth of elective communities with distinctive values, and cede control over some matters to them.</p>
<p>This will not be easy. However, a proper understanding of the nature of boundaries may take us quite a long way. The boundaries between social groups <em>are</em> always both nebulous and patterned: selectively permeable. Boundaries exist only through constant maintenance activity: judgements of who and what is on one side or the other, who and what may pass, and the actions taken accordingly. Such judgements can never be fully systematized, but undergo continual renegotiation. And so boundaries naturally evolve as circumstances change.</p>
<p>This understanding illuminates the vertical relationship between subsocieties and larger institutions; the horizontal relationship between different subsocieties; and the relationship between individuals and subsocieties.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_atomization">Embrace atomization</h2>
<p>The atomization of culture, society, and self has liquefied experience. This mode contributes the critical realization that perfect coherence is neither necessary nor even desirable.</p>
<p>At a practical, intuitive, kinesthetic level, we have become much more tolerant of nebulosity: of paradox, volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Accepting nebulosity is a major step toward the complete stance, and toward the fluid mode.</p>
<p>Abandoning coherence <em>altogether</em> produces an overwhelming ocean of meanings that do not relate to each other in any way. That gives an impression of pervasive triviality. Value judgements—even aesthetic ones—seem impossible when nothing hangs together. Society cannot function without coherent relationships.</p>
<p>And yet… we <em>do</em> make value judgements, and society <em>does</em> still function. We have developed skills for navigating the seas of meaning. Mainly without explicit understanding, we constantly re-create <em>relative</em> coherence. We have learned to assemble atoms of meaning into temporary sea-worthy vessels, and to let go of those as they dissolve.</p>
<p>We are, in other words, already in the fluid mode. As we <a href="/same-as-it-ever-was">always have been↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Now we just need to get good at it.</p>

<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> is part of a gigantic hypertext book, <cite><a href="https://meaningness.com/#contents">Meaningness</a></cite>. Readers who dislike the web format have often asked for paper or ebook versions of <cite>Meaningness</cite>. Unfortunately, it is much too large for that, and also I’m unlikely ever to finish it. However, as I complete chunks the size of a normal book, creating paper or ebook versions is possible.</p>
<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> gradually builds a complex, densely connected conceptual structure. It is not actually well-suited to reading in pieces. So I will publish it first in paperback and as a Kindle ebook. I’ll create others only if enough people buy it to make me believe there’s genuine demand.

<p>Eventually I’ll chop the book into blog-post-sized bits and post it here on the web as well. I prefer reading on the web, myself! Maybe most people do! And it’s free! On the other hand, most people discover web pages via google searches or social media shares, and they are likely to land somewhere in the middle of the book.

<p>Open-minded rationalists may recognize that meta-rationalists come at truth from some other angle, and try to figure out what we could possibly be talking about. “Why would some smart people, seemingly without evil agendas, think it’s good to believe false things?” they wonder. “Maybe sometimes it’s <em>pragmatically useful</em> to believe false things—and therefore rational in a broader sense? How might that work?” And some rationalists develop interesting theories about that.</p>
<p>But this misses meta-rationalism’s point. It’s <em>not</em> useful to believe false things, for the same reason it’s not useful to believe true things. There aren’t any of either—not in the rationalist’s sense of true and false.</p>
<p>This may sound contradictory, or like an attack on an absurd straw man. Am I spinning facile paradoxes that will turn out to be meaningless word games?</p>
<p>I hope to persuade you otherwise: there are no contradictions here, and a clear understanding of “neither true or false in the rationalist’s sense” has great practical import.</p>
<p>“In what sense?” is a characteristically meta-rational question. “Yes, there is water: in the cells of the eggplant” is true <em>in some sense</em>—probably not a useful one. It’s false in another, more relevant sense.</p>
<p>The sense in which “HIV causes AIDS” is true is more complex, strange, mysterious, and interesting than you’d probably think. Later in this discussion, I’ll explain the relevant biology in detail—and I think you will be surprised! We will see that there are practical public health consequences to the unexpected sense in which “HIV causes AIDS” is true.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_matters">Meta-rationality matters</h2>
<p>This exposition is long; technical in places; abstract and philosophical in others; and discusses less-than-pressing questions like “is the eggplant a fruit?” So you may wonder what the point is. Does “meta-rationality” matter, or is it meaningless ivory-tower philosophical wanking?</p>
<p>Meta-rationality matters because rationality matters. Rule of law, technology, and our post-subsistence economy are all products of rationality. They can’t survive without it. Rationality is under <a href="#extra18">heavy bombardment from irrationalists</a>, newly empowered by the internet, and civilizational collapse could result.</p>
<p>On the other hand, rationalism <a href="#chap153">has conclusively failed</a> in some respects. Enough smart people understand this that maintaining rational institutions by force is probably no longer feasible. Instead, meta-rationalism may deliver all the benefits of rationality, without rationalist errors. That might tip the balance of memetic power against irrationalists and <a href="#extra12">save the world</a> and stuff.</p>
<p>Here I hope to persuade you that wrong ideas about what “truth” and “belief” mean have large practical consequences, so getting a better understanding is important. I want to defend “truth” against irrationalists, but reject “truth” as misunderstood by rationalists.</p>
<p>What do “truth” and “belief” <em>mean</em>? These do sound like classic ivory-tower philosophical questions. Those are mostly nonsense and should be ignored. They are generally unanswerable; and having the “right” answers, if they existed, wouldn’t make any practical difference.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the meanings of “truth” and “belief” seem obvious enough. The sentence “HIV causes AIDS” is true because its meaning corresponds to reality: HIV <em>does</em> cause AIDS. Believing it means that you think the world is that way.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality concerns the relationship between rationality and the world. Rationalism has its own story about that, namely that rationality is the way to find beliefs (mental things) that are true (in the world). On careful investigation, this is empirically false. The world does not work in a way that could make any beliefs true in the sense that rationalism requires. The first main part of <cite><a href="#chap180">In the cells of the eggplant</a></cite> explains why not.</p>
<p>Important decisions, personal and political, often depend on knowing the truth of some matter. Rational methods are often the best way to find that. If rationality, pursued to its logical conclusion, endorsed the impossibility of truth or understanding, it would be really bad. But, whereas rationalism is mistaken, rational methods do often work. Meta-rationality is about how and why, and how to use rationality more effectively.</p>
<p>Recovering accurate, effective senses of “truth,” “belief,” and “rationality” requires a major re-thinking. The second half of <cite>The eggplant</cite> is about that.</p>

<h3 id="extra29_narrow">A narrow introduction, not a broad overview</h3>
<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> is a narrow introduction to meta-rationality, not a broad overview. An overview would cover most or all meta-rational topics briefly, on their own terms. I hope to write that someday.</p>
<p>The aim here instead is to lead gradually from rationality into meta-rationality via a single narrow path: what would “true belief” mean?</p>
<p>We are not going to look in detail at the main concern of meta-rationality, which is “How can I figure out what rational methods will be effective in this particular context?” And, we will also not address the main concerns of rationality, “What should I believe?” and “How should I make decisions?” These are all important, and meta-rationality has much to say about them, but the questions “what <em>are</em> truth and belief anyway?” are prior.</p>
<p>My hope is to lead the reader to a beachhead: a landing place within meta-rationality from which broader exploration becomes possible. My aim is to give some readers a partial understanding, and to inspire curiosity in others.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The discussion only points out some major landmarks along the path to meta-rationality. It’s not a detailed guide. For some readers, it may seem unhelpfully vague, and inadequately supported by argument or evidence. The aim, though is not to convince anyone of anything. Rather, to sketch a map that might inspire you to find your own way through the jungle between the major waypoints, or to go looking for more detailed maps elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_ready">Ready to move beyond STEM rationalism?</h3>
<p>The ability to think and act using formal rationality is precious, and far too rare. I worry that rational thought and action are waning, due to <a href="#extra12">current cultural dysfunction</a>. Promoting rationality, and defending it against <a href="#extra17">irrationalism</a>, is urgent and important.</p>
<p>People differ in cognitive style, personality, and preferences. Some master formal systems, use them effectively for years, but eventually begin to find them somewhat limited and limiting and dry. Others continue to enjoy working inside a formal system indefinitely. If that is you, you may not find this book to your liking. Nevertheless, I commend you: you are keeping the world running, for everyone else, in the face of mass idiocy, hysteric delusion, and tribal selfishness. Please continue!</p>
<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> is likely to be mainly useful to people who have already started to recognize the limitations of rational systems, and who are increasingly curious about how to go beyond them.</p>
<p>I wrote this particularly for people with a strong STEM background. (“Science, technology, engineering, and math.”) It uses mainly STEM examples, and occasionally gets quite technical. However, most of it can be understood without any particular STEM knowledge.</p>
<p>It does expect a strong background in <em>some</em> discipline of rationality—business management or law, for example, if not STEM. I could have written it in terms of the limitations of administrative rationality, using transformational business case studies; but STEM is my first love.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_parts">A book in two parts</h3>
<figure class="ctrimg"><img alt="Nautilus shell cut-away" height="282" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/iStock_000003596201XSmall.jpg" title="Nautilus shell cut-away" width="426"/></figure>
<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> has two main parts: one on rationalism, and the other on meta-rationalism.</p>
<p>The first part works through a series of increasingly sophisticated rational models that try to explain what “believing true things” would mean. Each has a fatal flaw. Each can be patched, producing a more complex model, which also fails. Eventually it becomes plausible that no similar model can work. That suggests we need some quite different story.</p>
<p>The second part of the book presents the meta-rational alternative: a different account of how rationality works and how best to use it.</p>
<p>The book is long enough, and difficult enough, that it needs an exponential spiral organization—like the shell of a nautilus—with repeated summaries and expansions. So here is a more detailed overview…</p>
<h3 id="extra29_introducing">Introducing an introduction</h3>
<p>Before the first part of the book, there’s an introduction. It includes the outline you are reading now, and then two bits that clarify terms.</p>
<p><a href="#extra29_terms">The first</a> bit distinguishes reasonableness, rationality, and rationalism. There is an everyday usage in which “rational” means just “not stupid or crazy.” To avoid confusion, I call this “reasonableness.” Then there are many types of formal rationality, such as those found in science, mathematics, and law. These rational systems should be distinguished from “rationalism,” a body of mistaken claims about how and when and why rationality works.</p>
<p><a href="#extra29_nebulosity">The second</a> bit introduces “ontological <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>”: the inherent indefiniteness of reality. Rejection of nebulosity is the root reason all rationalist theories have failed. Meta-rationality accepts nebulosity, and works with it effectively. Meta-rationalism is an explanation of how and when and why reasonableness, formal rationality, and meta-rationality work.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_intro_rationalism">Taking rationalism seriously</h3>
<p>Nowadays, rationalism often operates as a mere <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss1')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalistic</a> belief system—an unfounded <a href="#chap32">certainty</a> based on <a href="#chap33">imaginary understanding</a>. Historically, though, rationalism was a serious intellectual project: to justify rationality by applying it to itself. The goal was a well-defined, detailed, rational explanation of what rationality is and why it works. Initially, there was no obvious reason this should not have succeeded.</p>
<p>The first half of <cite>The Eggplant</cite> works through a series of attempts, and shows how each failed. The aim is not to refute these theories in detail—because it is uncontroversial that each <em>did</em> fail. Rather, we will examine each failure mode in enough detail to diagnose the problem. By comparing these individual diagnoses, a pattern emerges: the overall reason rationalism can’t work.</p>
<p>On our “narrow path,” we look only at the question: “What it would mean to believe a true fact?”</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>What sort of a thing would a belief have to be?</li>
<li>How would the world have to be in order for beliefs to be true or false?</li>
<li>What would the inside of your head look like if you had beliefs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each rationalist model fails to explain truth and belief for particular reasons. Each of these failures can be understood rationally, and so we can apply a patch to explain each class of anomalies, yielding a more complex and sophisticated model. (A “patch” is extra stuff added to software to fix a problem.)</p>
<p>Eventually, rationalism comes to look epicyclic: a hairy, buggy kludge of legacy machinery that still can’t explain key observations. At that point, one may simply hope someone can somehow make it work someday. However, analysis of its failure modes, followed by fundamental re-thinking, leads naturally to the quite different, meta-rational alternative.</p>
<p>The sequence of models roughly recapitulates the development of rationalist thought over the twentieth century. Particularly, it could be taken as a rough history of logical positivism, which was the last serious rationalist movement.</p>
<p>However, the goal here is not historical detail or accuracy, but understanding the intrinsic reasons each patch becomes necessary—as the failure modes of successive models come into view.</p>
<p>The final diagnosis is that every rationalist account gets wrecked, in stormy seas of counterexamples, on the black reef of ontological nebulosity.</p>
<p>If that already seems obvious to you, you could skip over the first half of the book, to go on to read about the meta-rational alternative.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_intro_remodeling">Ontological remodeling</h3>
<p>Our diagnosis was that rationalism assumes a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss2')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> ontology, which collides with the reality of ontological nebulosity. Meta-rationality takes ontologies as malleable. Ontological remodeling—reworking categories, properties, and relationships—is a key meta-rational operation.</p>
<p>Meta-rationalism remodels the rationalist ontology of truth, belief, and rationality. So, to understand <em>what sort of thing</em> meta-rationalism is (a remodeling), we need first to understand what meta-rationality <em>does</em> (remodel).</p>
<p>That is quite a complex and difficult subject. The first chapter of part 2 gives an intuitive introduction, relying heavily on specific examples from the history of science. It ends with an extensive discussion of the successive ontological remodelings of the category “planet.”</p>
<h3 id="extra29_intro_reasonableness">Taking reasonableness seriously</h3>
<p>Meta-rationalism’s explanation for how and when and why rationality works rests on an understanding of how and when and why mere reasonableness works.</p>
<p>Informal reasoning is adequate for most everyday tasks, and it it does not assume a fixed ontology. It usually deals with nebulosity effectively. How?</p>
<p>To find out, we need to take reasonableness seriously. We should not dismiss it—as rationalism often does—as irrelevant because it is irrational, or imagine that it is a crude, weak-sauce approximation to true rationality. It addresses issues formal rationality can’t and doesn’t.</p>
<p>We need to investigate reasonableness as an empirical phenomenon. I will review some major features and dynamics of reasonable activity that have been discovered through rigorous observation.</p>
<p>In summary, reasonableness works because it is context-dependent, purpose-laden, interactive, and tacit. The ways it uses language are effective for exactly the reason rationality considers ordinary language defective: nebulosity.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_intro_remodeling">Remodeling rationality</h3>
<p>Formal rationality aims for the opposite qualities: context-independence, purpose-independence, detachment, and explicitness. In some cases, it gains huge leverage by translating a problem from its nebulous real-world specifics into an abstract, formal realm, with a fixed ontology. It solves the problem in that domain, and re-applies the formal solution to the real-world situation.</p>
<p>Formal rationality depends on reasonableness for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it relies on reasonableness to translate between the nebulous real world and a clear-cut formal abstraction of it. In the simplest cases—sometimes encountered in real-world application of physics theories—that is a matter of simple approximation. The formalism applies directly, to within a fixed margin of error. In most cases, however, it is a much more complex, and nebulous, matter of interpretation and negotiation. These are non-rational, but reasonable, cognitive activities.</p>
<p>Second, perfect context-independence, purpose-independence, detachment, and explicitness can never be achieved—in principle, never mind in practice. Formal models cannot entirely meet these standards for “rationality,” even setting aside the interpretation issues and computational limitations. Rationality is, therefore, much more similar to “mere reasonableness” than rationalist ideology supposes. Further, in practice, formal reasoning is almost always intertwined with informal cognition.</p>
<p>After meta-rational remodeling, “truth” and “belief” appear as jumbles of disparate, nebulous phenomena, sharing only a vague family resemblance—but nevertheless important. This is why meta-rationalism isn’t “sometimes it’s good to believe false things,” or “intuition trumps logic,” or “truth is just a social construction,” or “whatever you take it be,” or any of those other anti-rational clichés.</p>
<p>Rationality, on the meta-rational view, is not <em>the</em> optimal method for discovering truths. It is a jumble of disparate methods of understanding, which work more or less well in different sorts of situations. That makes it no less valuable. And, taking this more realistic view of how and when and why rational methods work can help us apply them more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_intro_meta-rationality">Taking meta-rationality seriously</h3>
<p>Meta-rationality is reasoning about which rational methods to use, and how, in a specific situation. That can include remodeling systems by understanding how they relate to contexts and purposes.</p>
<p>Effective meta-rationality depends on meta-rationalism: an accurate understanding of how and when and why rational methods work.</p>
<p><cite>The Eggplant</cite> is not a manual of meta-rationality. The last part of the book aims more to explain what meta-rationality is, and ways it manifests, than to show you how to do it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it does explain some common meta-rational operations, and points out patterns in how they go. I plan to discuss this in more detail in follow-on work. However, I hope even the sketch here may have some practical use.</p>
<p>Does any of this matter?</p>
<p>STEM seems not to work as well as it used to. Hugely more research and development effort yields fewer breakthrough discoveries and fewer significant new products. New ideas seem increasingly hard to find. Many sciences now face a “replication crisis”: most supposed knowledge in these fields turns out to have been false. Eroom’s Law shows that it keeps taking exponentially more R&amp;D to generate new pharmaceuticals. Part of problem is doing rationality badly: failing to preregister experiment designs, or using lousy software development methods, for instance. I don’t think that’s the main thing.</p>
<p>Too much R&amp;D is mechanical by-the-book crank-turning, within a fixed framework, without reflection on whether it makes any sense in context. STEM can be “bad” not because it’s wrong, but because it’s trivial or irrelevant. Only a meta-rational view can help with that.</p>
<p>For individuals in STEM fields, meta-rationality becomes particularly important as one moves from being a technical contributor into management roles. Done well, management is an inherently meta-rational activity: it is about selecting, modifying, and creating systems, in the face of nebulosity. Entrepreneurship is even more obviously meta-rational: you create a company out of nothing, with no rules to guide you, only a nebulous understanding of a business opportunity.</p>
<p>Taking a still broader view:</p>
<p>Our societies, cultures, and selves also seem not to work as well as they used to. In <cite><a href="#chap148">How Meaning Fell Apart</a></cite>, I explained why. In short, the modern world was built on a foundation of rationalism. When rationalism failed, modernity ended. We live now in “postmodernity,” resulting from <a href="#chap160">abandoning rationality</a>, <a href="#chap169">universality</a>, and <a href="#chap173">coherence</a>. Postmodernity is characterized by <a href="#chap84">nihilistic malaise</a>, <a href="#chap173">atomization</a>, and <a href="#extra18">political dysfunction</a>. It could result in a civilization-ending catastrophe.</p>
<p>In <cite><a href="#chap178">Sailing the Seas of Meaningness</a></cite>, I suggest that recovering rational<em>ity</em> is an urgent antidote. However, attempting to reinstate modernity by force, on a foundation of rational<em>ism</em>, is infeasible (even if it were desirable). The failures of modernist rationalism are too obvious.</p>
<p>Meta-rationalism is an alternative, more accurate explanation for the value of rationality. I believe we can and should and will remodel society, culture, and ourselves on a meta-rational basis. That will deliver the benefits of rational modernity without its harms and errors.</p>

<p>This section explains how <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> uses these words: nebulosity; ontology and epistemology; rationality, rationalism and anti-rationalism; reasonableness and irrationality; meta-rationality and meta-rationalism.</p>
<p>It also sketches the ways these concepts relate to each other. That gives, in effect, another introductory summary of some major themes of the book.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_nebulosity">Nebulosity</h2>
<p>Literally, <dfn>nebulosity</dfn> means “cloud-like-ness”:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Boundaries</em>: Clouds do not have sharp edges; they thin out gradually at the margin. As you approach a cloud (in an aircraft, or on a mountain hike), you cannot say quite when you have entered it.</li>
<li><em>Identity</em>: It may be impossible to say where one cloud ends and another begins; whether two bits of cloud are part of the same whole or not; or to count the number of clouds in a section of the sky.</li>
<li><em>Categories</em>: Cirrocumulus shades into cirrus and into altocumulus; clouds of intermediate form cannot meaningfully be assigned to one or another.</li>
<li><em>Properties</em>:  Depending on temperature and density, clouds may be white, gray, blue, or <a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/droplets/irid1.htm">irridescent↗︎︎</a>. There are no specific dividing lines between these colors. Clouds have diverse, highly structured shapes, which cannot be precisely described. First, because the edges are vague; and second because the shape is so complex that a full description would be overwhelmingly gigantic even were it possible. Yet meteorologists find useful phrases like “ragged sheets,” “wavy filaments,” “bubbling protuberances,” or “castle-like turrets.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Clouds are an extreme case, but nebulosity is pervasive. Other than in mathematics and fundamental physics, nothing is ever definitely this-or-that. Everything is always somewhat this and somewhat that. Put under high enough magnification, a stainless steel ball exhibits the same indefiniteness as a cloud. No ball can be perfectly round, nor made of perfectly pure steel, nor can one definitely say that some particular atoms are part of it or part of its surrounds.</p>
<p>For this reason, there are few if any absolute truths about the eggplant-sized world. Mostly, the best we can ever get is “true for all practical purposes.” And most of the truths we use, even in the hard sciences, are “pretty much true” or “true as far as a particular use goes.” This raises occasional problems for rationality in practice, and causes serious difficulties for rationalism as a theory. Meta-rationalism addresses these issues effectively.</p>
<p>Because of nebulosity, definitions can’t be perfectly precise. Some categories hang together only by “family resemblance”: there is no single common feature, it’s just that this is similar to that, which is similar to another thing.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_ushyhqn" id="extra29_footnoteref1_ushyhqn" title="The understanding of categories in terms of “family resemblance” originates with Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations.">1</a></p>
<p>However, it’s often useful to sharpen categories somewhat, and to disambiguate word meanings to some extent. Several of the key terms in <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite>—especially “rationality”—have previously been used in multiple ways, and clarity requires pointing out which I intend. The definitions in this section will still be somewhat vague. Meanings will come into better focus gradually, through understanding words’ use in later discussions.</p>
<p>“Nebulosity” is itself, necessarily, a nebulous concept, which cannot be precisely defined. However, since it is so central to <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite>, I’ll explain it in more detail in a whole section after this one.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ontological">Ontological and epistemological</h2>
<p><cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> isn’t a philosophy book, so it uses “<dfn>ontological</dfn>” as engineers do.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_03b1m3u" id="extra29_footnoteref2_03b1m3u" title="Some of the questions I describe as “ontological” might rather be called “metaphysical” by philosophers. The distinction between ontology and metaphysics is nebulous, however. I’m mostly avoiding “metaphysics” because for many people it means “holistic chakra-balancing aromatherapy.” On the other hand, ontology, as a branch of academic philosophy, examines many issues that are out of this book’s scope.">2</a> Ontology is about how the world is. The ontological questions are: “What things, of what sorts, are there? What properties and relationships do they have?” By <dfn>an ontology</dfn>, engineers mean a set of answers, usually relative only to a specific domain.</p>
<p>Rather than advocating a particular ontology, I will reply, over and over again, in different ways: “These questions have no <em>definite</em> answers, due to nebulosity.” Meta-rationality is concerned mainly with ontological questions, and gives nebulous—but useful—answers.</p>
<p>Epistemology is about what we know of the world. The <dfn>epistemological</dfn> questions are: “What is knowledge? What is a belief? How can we get true beliefs and eliminate false ones?” Rationality is mainly concerned with these epistemological issues; it generally ignores ontological ones.</p>
<p>We can’t fully separate epistemology and ontology. The first part of this book shows how rationalism tries to do that, and so goes wrong. <em>How things are</em> partially determines how you can know them. Nebulosity is pervasive, so little could be known <em>definitely</em>, even if we had unlimited access to reality. Most facts about clouds and eggplants are not absolutely true, only true-enough, and so they cannot accurately be believed absolutely. Meta-rational epistemology takes this nebulosity of truth, knowledge, and belief into account.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rationality">Rationality</h2>
<p>Meanings of “<dfn>rational</dfn>” have evolved and proliferated over centuries. These share only a family resemblance, so no precise definition is possible. Various schools of thought have refined and promoted particular versions. Part I of <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> explores some specifically.</p>
<p>I will treat rationality as a practical activity, things we actually do, rather than as a metaphysical ideal we should aspire to. Generally, rational methods are formal, systematic, explicit, technical, abstract, atypical, non-obvious ways of thinking and acting, which have some distinctive virtue relative to informal ones.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_yqbyisg" id="extra29_footnoteref3_yqbyisg" title="Some non-rational systematic religions and philosophies would also meet these criteria. There is a “demarcation problem” here. The usual meaning of “the demarcation problem” is to find criteria that clearly distinguish science from non-science. This seems to be impossible. Different sciences seem to bear only a family resemblance to each other, with no single feature in common. However, the demarcation problems for both science and rationality are rarely an issue in practice. We know science and rationality when we see them, and can usually make a cogent argument for why a particular method or system is scientific or rational or not, even if there is no general rule.">3</a></p>
<p>“Systematic” and “formal” are key criteria, but both are nebulous. They are a matter of degree. Mathematical logic is extremely formal; a chemistry methods manual is quite formal; a corporate personnel policy is somewhat formal; a “Do Today” task checklist is only barely formal.</p>
<p>Rationality works mainly with general knowledge. Ideally, it aims for universal truths. Generally, knowledge of a specific object does not count as “rational” unless it applies to every other object in some class. The glory of Newton’s theory of gravity is that it is true uniformly everywhere in the universe, equally for an apple and an asteroid.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_lkqx9uw" id="extra29_footnoteref4_lkqx9uw" title="This applies to semi-formal rational systems as well. A company policy that said “employees must turn in their weekly timesheets by the following Thursday, except Bertrand” would not count as rational. In a rational policy, if Bertrand is an exception, it must be as an instance of a class. For example, if Bertrand is an exception because he’s on a secret solo dogsled expedition to the South Pole, a rational policy would be “employees must turn in their timesheets by the following Thursday, unless they are out of internet range, in which case they must turn it in by the Thursday following their return to civilization.”">4</a> In fact, we’ll see that formal systems cannot deal with particular physical objects <em>at all</em>—one reason rationality is inadequate by itself.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_reasonableness">Reasonableness and irrationality</h2>
<p>In everyday usage, “rational” has an informal meaning of “thinking and acting in ways that make sense and are likely to work.” In this sense, “rational” is synonymous with “sensible.” It means “not stupid, crazy, or meaningless.” Somewhat arbitrarily, I will call this <dfn>reasonableness</dfn>, and reserve “rationality” for systematic methods.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_ph0zu7w" id="extra29_footnoteref5_ph0zu7w" title="Although the concept is familiar to everyone, there seems to be no standard word for what I’m calling “reasonableness.” That is probably because it is usually viewed as a half-baked approximation to rationality, and therefore can be ignored. As we will see, this is inaccurate.">5</a></p>
<p>Much of <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> is about the relationship between these two. Understanding that is a prerequsite for meta-rationality. Rationalism misunderstands reasonableness as a primitive approximation to rationality. In fact, it has somewhat different—though overlapping—functions. “Mere” reasonableness addresses the nebulosity of the everyday world effectively, which formal rationality can’t. Meta-rationality combines resources from reasonableness and rationality, plus ones of its own, to understand and act effectively in circumstances the others cannot manage.</p>
<p>I’ll use <dfn>irrational</dfn> to mean failure to think well or act effectively when you should. It means “unreasonable” or “nonsensical,” or “stupid” or “crazy,” in the non-clinical sense of those words.</p>
<p>By this definition, irrationality is contrary to all three of reasonableness, rationality, and meta-rationality. I will not use it to mean “not systematically rational.”</p>
<h2 id="extra29_rationalism">Rationalism and anti-rationalism</h2>
<p>I will use <dfn>rationalism</dfn> to mean any belief system extolling broad claims about value of rationality, going beyond the evidence of common experience. In the plural, <dfn>rationalisms</dfn> are diverse belief systems of this sort.</p>
<p>The most influential rationalisms attempt universality across domains: they are meant to apply in all situations and task types. Others are more specific: particular notions of rationality that apply only in mathematics, science, law, management, or accounting. <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> considers mainly universal rationalisms, or ones meant to apply broadly in technical fields.</p>
<p>Typically, rationalisms attempt to form rational theories of rationality. That is, they seek systematic, explicit, technical, abstract, non-obvious explanations for how and why rationality works. Ideally, they aim for definite proof of rationality’s universal efficacy.</p>
<p>Typically, rationalisms specify some ultimate criterion according to which thinking or acting could be judged to be correct or optimal. Typically, they say that thinking in accordance with the criterion reliably produces true beliefs. They may also claim rationality yields maximally effective action.</p>
<p>For rationalism, ideal rationality means conforming to the criterion. Rationalism is normative: everyone <em>ought</em> to think and act that way, as nearly as possible.</p>
<p>Under this definition, “rationalism” must go beyond “formal methods are often useful, hooray!” That <em>is</em> the common experience: for anyone who uses such methods, their value is obvious.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_yu2487u" id="extra29_footnoteref6_yu2487u" title="In “Ignorant, irrelevant, and inscrutable,” I discuss the irrationalists who simply don’t understand that formal methods are often useful, and the anti-rationalists who oppose systematic rationality for aesthetic, political, religious, or “spiritual” reasons. Since the European Enlightenment, anti-rationalism  has mainly been suppressed in favor of a consensus in favor of rationality among the powerful. There are ominous signs that this consensus may now be failing. See “A bridge to meta-rationality vs. civilizational collapse.”">6</a> I will use <dfn>rationalist</dfn> to mean someone who promotes rationalism—rather than someone who just finds methods of systematic rationality often useful in practice.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a variety of  claims about rationality, roughly from weaker to stronger:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is better to be rational than irrational</li>
<li>Systematic rationality often works, so you should use it when appropriate</li>
<li>Rationality (whose definition is left vague) is always good</li>
<li>Rationality is all there is to thinking and acting well; it is sufficient for all purposes, and there’s nothing else you need</li>
<li>Rationality is defined by such-and-such a criterion; you should conform to it as nearly as you can</li>
<li>Certain specified methods meet the rationality criterion, so you should use them whenever you can</li>
<li>There’s a single master method of rationality, which <a href="#chap32">guarantees</a> an optimal result</li>
</ol>
<p>I think claims 1 and 2 are correct. I will not count them as “rationalism.” Not everyone agrees with them, though. Let’s say <dfn>anti-rationalism</dfn> is any worked-out denial of either 1 or 2. Meta-rationalism is not anti-rationalism, since it affirms both. “Rationalism” might be defined as holding claim 4 or above. Meta-rationalism denies 4-7, so it is not rationalism.</p>
<p>Claim 3 is a diffuse attitude of alignment. If rationality means just “thinking and acting well,” then it is correct by definition. Also, claim 3 is importantly right if it’s just a rejection of anti-rationalism. On the other hand, a diffuse, incoherent rationalist faith is imparted implicitly in the STEM curriculum. There <a href="#chap51">must be</a> a correct way to think, some rationalists suggest, but we don’t know quite what it is; or they extol a vague principle like “the scientific method.” No one has been able to give a detailed, empirically adequate explanation of what “the scientific method” is, so advocating it is nearly vacuous.</p>
<p>I think the stronger claims 4-7 are mistaken. Formal rationality is rarely if ever sufficient on its own in real-world situations; there’s no fixed criterion for rationality; nothing can be guaranteed by or about rationality in practice; and there is no method that is always rational to use.</p>
<p>Distinguishing weaker and stronger claims about rationality may help correct both rationalist and anti-rationalist errors. I suspect many anti-rationalists react to overstated rationalist claims, rightly rejecting them, but then mistakenly go on to deny that systematic rationality is often valuable. I suspect many rationalists rightly wish to  defend rationality’s genuine value, but mistakenly go on to affirm implausibly strong claims as well. Rationality <em>does</em> have “distinctive virtues” (which we’ll return to in Part III); but these are nebulous and cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Rationalism is based on a fantasy of how we would <em>like</em> knowledge, action, and reality to work. It would be highly convenient if they did. In a world without nebulosity, in which objects and properties were perfectly crisp, rationality would be fully adequate. But we do not live in such a world. To the extent that rationality does work, it is largely because we have engineered our world to make it behave more nearly that way.</p>
<p>Non-rational, reasonable judgement is unreliable, sometimes uncomfortable, and leads to conflict when people get different answers. When they get stubborn about that, or when misjudgment leads to disaster, it’s easy to regard all “reasonableness” as simply irrational. The <a href="#chap42">hope</a> of rationalism is that some mechanical criterion or procedure could provide <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap34">control</a> by eliminating non-rational factors. This is not possible, because rationality by itself can’t deal with the nebulous eggplant-sized world <em>at all</em>. Abstract, formal reasoning cannot reach into that realm; it requires reasonable activity as a bridge.</p>
<p>The problem with rationalism is not that it is false as an abstract philosophical theory. (Who cares?) The problem is that it is misleading in practice. It encourages you to overlook nebulosity, and the bridging function of reasonableness it demands; so you end up using rationality wrongly. This is not a minor or theoretical danger. The replication crisis has revealed that <em>most</em> supposed knowledge in many scientific fields, derived through misuse of rational methods, is false.</p>
<p>Part I of <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> explains a series of specific technical difficulties rationalism encounters. Each failure mode has the same underlying cause: <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denial', 'gloss0')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also fixation, another defense.

Equivalently, it is the fixation of patterns as ontological absolutes. I mostly don’t use these terms in The Eggplant.">7</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_meta">Meta-rationality and meta-rationalism</h2>
<p><dfn>Meta-rationality</dfn> means figuring out how to apply rationality in a specific situation, and skill in doing so. It is a word I made up, to cover disparate insights about the use of rationality gathered from many fields. A few people have used the term “meta-rationality” with similar meanings before, in passing, but I don’t know of any previous detailed account.</p>
<p>Rationality and meta-rationality are complementary <em>activities</em>. Meta-rationality is not an alternative to rationality. Neither can operate without the other; they walk hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality is not in the business of finding true beliefs or optimal actions. That’s rationality’s job. On the other hand, getting good at meta-rationality will make you more effective at rationality, and therefore better at finding true beliefs and optimal actions.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality selects and adapts rational methods to circumstances, so it is meaningless without rationality. Conversely, you cannot apply rationality without making meta-rational choices. However, since meta-rationality is rarely taught explicitly, it’s common to use only the simplest, default meta-rational criteria. Those are meta-rational nonetheless: there is no universal rational method, so in any situation you have to choose one and figure out how to apply it.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality is not the application of formal rationality to itself (as one might suppose from its name).<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_i9ce6ww" id="extra29_footnoteref8_i9ce6ww" title="To avoid this possible confusion, a better term might be “circumrationality.” It’s about the circumstances that surround the application of rationality. That sounds cumbrous, though. I don’t much like any of the alternative terms I’ve considered.">8</a> Applying rationality to itself is a rationalist program. We’ll see that, because of nebulosity, reasoning about how to apply rationality cannot be formally rational. (But it should not be irrational or anti-rational either!)</p>
<p><dfn>Meta-rationalism</dfn> is an understanding of how and when and why reasonableness, rationality, and meta-rationality work. Whereas rationality and meta-rationality are different sorts of things, rationalism and meta-rationalism are the <em>same</em> sort of thing: accounts of effective thought and action. Meta-rationalism finds rationalism an inadequate account, and offers a complete replacement.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_auf0ksf" id="extra29_footnoteref9_auf0ksf" title="Logically, there could be multiple meta-rationalisms: different theories about the relationships among reasonableness, rationality, and meta-rationality. Currently, there is not even one fully worked-out version, so meta-rationalisms in the plural are only hypothetical.">9</a>
So, perhaps confusingly, while rationality and meta-rationality are <em>complementary activities</em>, rationalism and meta-rationalism are <em>incompatible theories</em>.</p>
<p>Once you recognize that denial of nebulosity is the deep structure underlying each of the difficulties rationalism encounters, the solution approach is obvious: accept  nebulosity from the beginning, and work with it, instead of trying to ignore or eliminate it. As a practice, meta-rationality does just that. As a theory, meta-rationalism is a more accurate account of the sort of world we live in; and so it gives better advice than rationalism in cases in which nebulosity matters.</p>
<p><dfn>Meta-systematicity</dfn> is a broader category that includes meta-rationality. It is reflection on how systems, not necessarily formally rational ones, relate to their circumstances. One may take a meta-systematic approach to psychological, social, and cultural systems. These possibilities are explored elsewhere in <cite><a href="#chap90">Meaningness</a></cite>, the work of which <cite><a href="#chap180">The Eggplant</a></cite> is a part.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_c1w6nt9" id="extra29_footnoteref10_c1w6nt9" title="Meta-rationality and meta-rationalism are both also types of metacognition, another related term used mainly in education theory.

This seems to be impossible. Different sciences seem to bear only a family resemblance to each other, with no single feature in common.

<p class="intro_para">
We have arrived at the midpoint of <cite><a href="#chap180">In the cells of the eggplant</a></cite>. In its first part, we saw how every attempt to make rationalism work failed, in each case because it <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'denied', 'gloss0')" title="Denial is the psychological strategy of refusing to admit the existence or significance of meaningness.

[Click for details.]">nebulosity</a>. The second part explains how meta-rationality works with ontological nebulosity to resolve the problems rationalism encountered.
</p>
<p>Formal rationality usually works within a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss2')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> ontology, unquestioned and often implicit. That works well so long as the ontology is good enough for the job at hand. When it isn’t, total breakdown can result, because rationality has no way of repairing the breach.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality stands outside any particular ontology. It treats ontologies as malleable, and manipulates them explicitly. It evaluates, selects, combines, modifies, discovers, and creates alternative ones.</p>
<p><dfn>Ontological remodeling</dfn>—the reconfiguration of individuation criteria, categories, properties, and relationships—is a relatively advanced meta-rational activity. Ideally, we would build up extensive conceptual prerequisites before discussing it. The topic might be best left to the end of <cite>The eggplant</cite>—or, in fact, to some other text.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_nc0fhg7" id="extra29_footnoteref1_nc0fhg7" title="See “A first lesson in metarationality” for an introduction to ontological remodeling. I’ll return to the topic only briefly near the end of The eggplant. Detailed discussion of methods of remodeling will have to wait for future texts.">1</a></p>
<p>Except that we need this idea to explain what sort of thing meta-rationality is. Namely, meta-rationality <em>is itself</em> an ontological remodeling of rationality.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>This coincidence is potentially confusing. We need to recognize ontological remodeling at two levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the meta level, moving from rationalism to meta-rationality requires remodeling the fundamental ontological categories of rationality, such as truth, belief, deduction, induction, and so on.</li>
<li>At the object level, ontological remodeling is a major aspect of the subject matter of meta-rationality.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the shift from the rationalist to meta-rational view is an instance of the thing meta-rationalism describes. This is unfortunate, because it implies that meta-rationality is required in order to understand meta-rationality. Formal rationality doesn’t include an account of ontological remodeling, which is the skill needed to see the possibility of an alternative view. So meta-rationalism is a prerequisite for itself, which is part of what makes the shift difficult.</p>
<p>As always when something is a prerequisite for itself, you have to proceed in a spiral. An approximate understanding of a small part of the subject makes it possible to grasp more of it, and thereby to revise your understanding of the initial beachhead. You need repeated passes over the topic, in increasing breadth and depth, to master it.</p>
<p>So this “middle bit” of <cite>The Eggplant</cite> provides a rough, informal, partial account of ontological remodeling—enough to help the second major part make sense.</p>
<p>To make it concrete, I use examples taken from the history of science. I find them interesting for their own sake, and I hope you too find them enjoyable as well as enlightening.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_extinction">The extinction and survival of categories</h2>
<p>Often remodeling begins by recognizing that a category isn’t a well-defined grouping for which there can be a meaningful, unified story.</p>
<p>During ontological remodeling, a category may:</p>
<ol class="tight_list">
<li>Disappear completely</li>
<li>Convert from formal to informal status</li>
<li>Get a new formal meaning</li>
</ol>
<p>A category disappears when it turns out there’s nothing in it—the entities it grouped don’t exist—or when it groups entities that have nothing meaningfully in common. In scientific history, categories like phlogiston, the luminiferous aether, and the Philosopher’s Stone turned out to have nothing in them, and got dropped. The taxon “Bestiae,” the Great Chain of Being, and the Hippocratic humors turned out to group genuine entities in useless ways, and so were also dropped.</p>
<p>The second possible outcome is that a category turns out to be too stubbornly nebulous for any formal account of it to work. Then it may hang on informally. It is no longer “officially” part of the new ontology, but people still talk about it, because it’s heuristically useful. Some or all entities in the category may get new, formal, detailed and precise accounts, which are actually much more accurate than before reformulation, but the general case remains vague.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg"><div class="youtube_outer_wrapper"><div class="youtube_inner_wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="youtube" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m-Q96XnGRPs?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div></div><figcaption class="youtubecaption">Burning sugar with sodium chlorate as oxidizer</figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, fire was an ontologically basic, formal category for thousands of years. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_revolution">Chemical Revolution↗︎︎</a> of the 1700s, it dropped out of official scientific theory. It’s an ill-formed category, because there are too many marginal cases. Informally, it describes redox reactions within a nebulous range of rates and temperatures, in which the oxidizer is typically but not necessarily oxygen. An explosion is a too-fast redox reaction; rusting is too slow to count; fuel cell reactions run too cold. Burning sugar with sodium chlorate as the oxidizer sure <em>looks</em> like a fire, but should it count? On the other hand, although “fire” is no longer a formal category, the Chemical Revolution made it possible to understand combustion in general, and particular redox reactions, vastly better than before.</p>
<p>“Species” was an ontologically basic, formal category in biology for thousands of years. Over the past few decades, better understanding of population dynamics has shown that it’s unavoidably nebulous. In general, there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether or not two individuals belong to the same species. However, as a consequence of that same remodeling, we understand speciation processes far better than when the category was taken to be well-defined.</p>
<p>In 2006, the category “planet” disintegrated into absurdity. It got a new, official definition, which most everyone loathes and ignores. Discovery of numerous marginal cases made it clear that “planets” have nothing meaningfully in common. However, we understand individual planets far better than before. And, “planet” is still useful as a vague category in some contexts, so long as you realize there is no fact-of-the-matter about whether Pluto counts.</p>
<p>In the third outcome of remodeling a category, it gets a new formal meaning. Gravity, for example, has been remodeled several times. It is not that we discovered new equations governing gravity each time—although that did happen. It’s that <em>what gravity means</em> changed. In general relativity, gravity is a wrinkle in spacetime; that is not what gravity is in Newtonian mechanics. Lumping and splitting are other ways a category can survive remodeling. The 2006 remodeling put Pluto in a newly invented category of “dwarf planets,” which (despite the name) are officially not counted as “planets.”</p>
<p>Informally, we can think of these three outcomes as points on a continuum. We might say a category is around 1.5 if it is mainly dropped as useless by experts, but retained in popular language, for instance. As for 2.5, whether or not a category counts as “basic,” “formal,” or “official” is itself often somewhat nebulous.</p>
<p>In <cite>The eggplant</cite>, I will concentrate on the second possible outcome of remodeling, although the others may be equally important in general. The meta-rational remodeling of rationality mainly demotes its categories from formal to informal status (outcome #2), but retains them as heuristically useful.</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>“Truth” comes out somewhere around 2.2. It’s best thought of as many different vaguely-similar nebulous ideas.</li>
<li>“Belief” may be somewhere around 1.6: a mostly-useless and misleading category if taken seriously, although it’s necessary for communication in everyday language.</li>
<li>“Rationality” gets a 2.7. It’s a grouping of usefully similar and reasonably well-defined methods that we should think about differently than we did before the meta-rational remodeling. There are marginal cases, though, so it’s not a 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section, I use shifting ideas about what counts as a planet as examples of ontological remodeling. I interweave scientific history with brief explanations of the meta-rational themes it illustrates. This isn’t a general history of the changing understandings of “planets”; I’ve selected particular episodes for their relevance to the themes of <cite>The eggplant</cite>. However, I find these shifts fascinating, both as science and as history, so I go into a fair amount of detail. I think you’ll learn some surprising facts!</p>

<p>It has long been established, by both evidence and rationality, that the gods live in the sky. As gods are important, the sky is of great interest to scientists. Besides gods, who are rarely observed, we see three categories of objects in the sky, distinguished by their modes of motion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transient objects with irregular, unpredictable motions, such as birds, clouds, and comets. These can be seen to be quite close to the earth, which is also characterized by chaotic unpredictability and transience, so this makes excellent sense and is consistent with rationality.</li>
<li>The stars, which are eternally unchanging, and whose motions are perfectly circular. There’s a simple explanation: they are fires visible through tiny holes in a black sphere, centered on the earth, that revolves daily. The sphere is clearly hundreds of miles away, close to the immortal gods, so this is also highly rational.</li>
<li>Seven <dfn>wanderers</dfn>, or “<i>planetai</i>” in Greek. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet">These are↗︎︎</a> the Moon, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Unlike stars, they speed up and slow down, slew sideways, and sometimes even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion">go backward↗︎︎</a>. Unlike birds and stuff, their motions are somewhat predictable, but in ridiculously complex patterns. This is not so obviously rational. What’s up with it?</li>
</ol>

<p>Apparently the Wanderers are an intermediate category, for which we need a rational explanation. Aristotle and his colleague <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus#Astronomy">Eudoxus↗︎︎</a> figured out the basics, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy↗︎︎</a> nailed the details. The planets are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_of_the_celestial_spheres">attached to spheres↗︎︎</a>, made of pure, eternal, aetheric crystal. Through cunning arrangement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">several dozen↗︎︎</a> of them, each moving in a perfect circle, the apparently complex planetary motions become perfectly predictable.</p>
<p>Or, to within a few degrees of angular error, anyway.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_angels">Unemployed angels, spirals, and the dark</h3>
<p>What causes the aetheric spheres to rotate? Scientific opinion has varied. By the end of the Middle Ages, the general consensus was that each sphere was turned by an angel.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">a revolution↗︎︎</a> put the celestial company of angelic laborers out of work. Lacking alternative opportunities for employment, they ceased to exist.</p>
<p>That is, by Galileo’s time, strong evidence had accumulated that there were no spheres, and therefore no angels. We have no need of that hypothesis.</p>
<p>This is an example of categories (aetheric spheres, angels) completely vanishing during an ontological remodeling: outcome #1.</p>
<p>By contrast, the question “what makes heavenly bodies move in such complicated patterns” has come through multiple remodelings intact (outcome #3). We’re still making progress on it. For instance, recent work on the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Galactic_magnetic_fields">magnetohydrodynamics of galaxies↗︎︎</a> seems to be converging toward an explanation for their previously-mysterious spiral shapes.</p>
<p>But we’re still far from a complete story. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy#Theories_of_dark_energy">No one has a clue↗︎︎</a> about the apparent acceleration of the universe’s expansion. It is attributed to “dark energy”; but that is a mere <dfn><a href="https://vividness.live/2012/05/03/your-self-is-not-a-spiritual-obstacle/#dormitive">dormitive principle↗︎︎</a></dfn>: a science-y name masquerading as an explanation. “Acceleration requires energy by definition, and we can’t find any, so it must be ‘dark energy’.” But “dark energy” is not compatible with any currently-credible physical theory.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Copernicus">Copernicus remodels the planets</h3>
<p>You will recall, from <a href="#chap152">invented history</a>, that Copernicus set off the Scientific Revolution in 1543 by proving that Aristotle, Eudoxus, and Ptolemy were wrong, because the earth goes around the sun. This did not happen.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_keolo88" id="extra29_footnoteref2_keolo88" title="My main source for the history of heliocentrism is Thomas Kuhn’s The Copernican Revolution, which I recommend highly. It is simultaneously super geeky and admirably easy to read. He wrote it sixty years ago, and probably there’s been significant historical research in the mean time. However, from casual investigation only, it appears that none of his main conclusions have been overturned.">2</a> He did propose a heliocentric (sun-centered) model that became influential starting several decades after his death, however.</p>
<p>Copernicus retained all the previous ontological categories, including circular orbits and crystal spheres; they came through the remodeling intact (outcome #3). Mostly, only their relationships changed.</p>
<p>The category most transformed was “planet.” This had two intertwined aspects: an ontological remodeling of the category, plus empirical claims about the nature of specific objects.</p>
<p>Ontologically, where “planet” had meant “lights that wander in the sky,” it now meant “things that go around the sun.” Empirically, the claim was that all the old planets go around the sun, except the moon and the sun itself, so those are not <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss3')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> planets after all. Most troublingly, the earth too goes around the sun, so it is a planet.</p>
<p>The earth does not wander in the sky; it does not glow like the planets; it is extremely large, whereas most planets are mere pinpoints. Why call the earth a planet? This made <em>absolutely no sense</em> in Copernicus’ time. The claim appeared not false, but absurd: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category error↗︎︎</a>. But for Copernicus, the earth was a planet exactly in that it does wander around the universe, instead of sitting still at the center.</p>
<p>Maybe heliocentrism would have succeeded sooner if Copernicus used a different word for his remodeled category! This is a common pattern, though: an existing word is repurposed during remodeling. There is no fact-of-the-matter about whether “planet” denoted a new, different category, or if the category itself changed and kept its same name. As in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus and Grandfather’s Axe↗︎︎</a> parables, the continuity of identity of categories over time is nebulous.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_absurd">Heliocentrism: absurd on the face of it</h3>
<p>It took well over a century after Copernicus for most scientists to adopt heliocentrism. That was not mainly because of opposition from the Church, nor due to blind adherence to traditional authorities. It was because empiricism and rationality both contradicted his theory. In fact, multiple heliocentric models had been proposed by the Ancient Greeks—Copernicus got the idea from them—and they were periodically revived up to his time. They had always been dismissed as fanciful, for lack of evidence or sense. So was Copernicus’—for a long time.</p>
<p>The puzzle is not “why didn’t scientists immediately adopt heliocentrism once Copernicus proved it was true?” but “why did anyone take him seriously at all, considering he failed to give any adequate reason to think it was true?”</p>
<p>There was no good observational evidence for heliocentrism until Galileo observed the phases of Venus in 1610. Copernicus’ arguments all invoked conceptual aesthetics, not evidence.</p>
<p>Copernicus’s model explained dramatically <em>fewer</em> phenomena than the state of the art.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_ruawqc8" id="extra29_footnoteref3_ruawqc8" title="Copernican heliocentrism did explain some phenomena previous systems couldn’t. Particularly, it unambiguously determined the diameters of the planetary orbits. We’ll see that this is typical of ontological remodelings: the new and old models explain different subsets of phenomena, or explain them more and less well.">3</a> It is difficult to convey how extensive and important geocentrism’s implications were. It was woven, with rational arguments, into the whole Aristotelian and Medieval Christian worldview. All those explanations now seem absurd, but they were vital at the time. When geocentrism failed, the entire prevailing structure of <a href="#chap32">certainty</a> failed with it, and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss4')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

(There’s an interesting parallel here with the nihilism precipitated in the 20th century <a href="#chap153">collapse of the modern structure</a> of understanding.)</p>
<p>Copernicus’s model gave no more accurate predictions of planetary motions than the best available geocentric models. And, contrary to the invented history you may recall, Copernicus’ model was no simpler than previous ones. In particular, it had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle">more epicycles↗︎︎</a>, which he needed in order to eliminate equants, another type of technical kludge that he particularly disliked.</p>
<p>There was also excellent evidence <em>against</em> heliocentrism. For example, the absence of stellar parallax was considered a fatal flaw until much later, when astronomers recognized that the “fixed” stars must be ridiculously far away.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_lazed4m" id="extra29_footnoteref4_lazed4m" title="Copernicus did give this explanation, to his credit. Stellar parallax was finally observed, after sufficiently accurate instruments were developed, in the 1800s.">4</a></p>
<h3 id="extra29_unfixable">Heliocentrism: not known to be unfixable</h3>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Ibn al-Shatir’s epicyclic model of Mercury" height="458" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/Shatir_epicycles_473x458.jpg" title="Ibn al-Shatir’s epicyclic model of Mercury" width="473"/></figure>
<p>All geocentric systems—there were many—assumed an ontology of perfectly circular motions. To account for the apparently non-circular motions of the planets, they used complex combinations of <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath639/kmath639.htm">epicycles, deferents, eccentrics, and equants↗︎︎</a>. These were, effectively, mechanical linkages and offsets that produced complex motions as combinations of multiple circular ones.</p>
<p>The problem was to hook these devices up in a way to generate predictions that agreed with observations. Thousands of smart people worked on this for thousands of years, tinkering with the details, and made essentially no progress after Ptolemy (around 150 A.D.). The best models as of Copernicus’ time still predicted eclipses wrong by a day, and the position of Mars by a degree.</p>
<p>For astrologers, a day or a degree makes all the difference! This was highly unsatisfactory and discouraging. Most thought that eventually the discrepancies would be ironed out with a sufficiently clever arrangement of epicycles, but others recognized that something must be wrong.</p>
<p>For decades, the only people interested in Copernicus’ work were astro-math geeks who spent all their time trying to reorganize the gears to make the machine give the right answers. The fact that his system made absolutely no sense, considered as physics or cosmology, was not relevant for them. Astrologers were practical men, chronometric engineers whose livelihoods depended on accurate predictions, not highfalutin’ philosophy.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_s36ot5t" id="extra29_footnoteref5_s36ot5t" title="Besides astrologers, the other early enthusiasts for Copernicanism were Neoplatonic mystics. They thought, for spiritual reasons, that the universe ought to conform to simple mathematical rules; in their view Ptolemaic geocentrism was a godawful mess of kludges. The outstanding example was Kepler, whose heliocentrism was based on a Neoplatonic emanationist conviction that the Sun was God’s manifestation in the material realm, and therefore ought to be at the center of the universe. Fortuitously, his certainty that simple mathematical relationships must determine the cosmos led to his weird-but-true theory of elliptical orbits, which both dramatically simplified Copernicus’ system and gave much more accurate predictions. It also led to his elegant-but false theory that the distances between the planets related to the regular polyhedra. It’s interesting—but probably not significant—that the earliest advocates for what was later considered the first step in the Scientific Revolution were all woomeisters, who were right for the wrong reasons.">5</a></p>
<p>Copernicus’ system was just another arrangement of circular motions via epicycles, deferents, and eccentrics. And it gave no better predictions than the state of the art. But it was sufficiently different that it <em>wasn’t known to be unfixable</em>. Every imaginable variant on geocentrism had been tried, and found not to work. Copernicus opened up new opportunities for obsessive tinkering that held out a reasonable hope of progress.</p>
<p>And, it turned out that other heliocentric arrangements could and did give somewhat more accurate results. Quite soon, everyone else relied on heliocentric calculations for prediction, even while firmly holding that they were a purely mathematical fiction—because, interpreted as physics, heliocentrism was a non-starter.</p>
<p>This is a pattern. When you are stuck, an alternative ontology may be attractive, even in the absence of other virtues, by giving you new ways of thinking about the problem.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_unworkable">Meta-rationality: not known to be unworkable</h3>
<p>Just as problems with geocentrism had been known for centuries, problems with rationalism have been known for centuries. The logical positivists fixed some, but eventually gave up on trying to fix the rest. After centuries of failed attempts by super-smart people to create a workable version, it remains possible that somehow someone can make the overall approach succeed someday—but it no longer seems likely.</p>
<p>Heliocentrism had been around for centuries, and was only initially adopted by Copernicus and a few others in desperation, because it at least was something new to try.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_9c4r2pa" id="extra29_footnoteref6_9c4r2pa" title="In Copernicus’ own words: “I pondered long upon this uncertainty of mathematical tradition in establishing the motions of the system of the spheres. At last I began to chafe that philosophers could by no means agree on any one certain theory of the mechanism of the Universe, wrought for us by a supremely good and orderly Creator, though in other respects they investigated with meticulous care the minutest points relating to its circles. I therefore took pains to read again the works of all the philosophers on whom I could lay hand to seek out whether any of them had ever supposed that the motions of the spheres were other than those demanded by the mathematical schools. I found first in Cicero that Hicetas had realized that the Earth moved [and so did various other ancients; Copernicus quotes them here]. Taking advantage of this I too began to think of the mobility of the Earth; and though the opinion seemed absurd, yet knowing now that others before me had been granted freedom to imagine such circles as they chose to explain the phenomena of the stars, I considered that I also might easily be allowed to try whether, by assuming some motion of the Earth, sounder explanations than theirs for the revolution of the celestial spheres might so be discovered.”">6</a></p>
<p>Analogously, meta-rationality has been around for more than half a century,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_1zsebw9" id="extra29_footnoteref7_1zsebw9" title="One might take as founding texts Heidegger’s Being and Time, published in German in 1927 and in English in 1962; Wittgenstein’s 1953 Philosophical Investigations; Kuhn’s 1962 The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; and Garfinkel’s 1967 Studies in Ethnomethodology. Key later works include Kegan’s 1982 The Evolving Self and Schön’s 1983 The Reflective Practitioner.">7</a> and we can <em>at least</em> say that it’s not known to be unworkable. There has been continuing progress in making it handle more details; it seems plausible, to some smart people, that it can eventually encompass and supersede the rationalist worldview. However, it hasn’t been fully worked out, and it hasn’t been explained well,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_gqgnfg5" id="extra29_footnoteref8_gqgnfg5" title="Each of the books I listed as a key meta-rational text is famously difficult to read. I would suggest going to secondary sources before tackling the originals.">8</a> and for at least those reasons it is not widely accepted—or even known of.</p>
<p>Mistaken theories accumulate kludgy patches until there is a better alternative. Failure to account for data does not cause the demise of a theory. Rationalism persists, despite its well-known inadequacies, because it’s clearly better than irrationalism and anti-rationalism, the only well-known alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_revolution">A meta-scientific revolution</h3>
<p>Heliocentrism may be the most obvious example of ontological remodeling, because Thomas Kuhn’s 1962 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007USH7J2/?tag=meaningness-20">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions↗︎︎</a> highlighted it.</p>
<p>Historians agree that Kuhn’s book dealt the death-blow to logical positivism. That is not because he gave a knock-down argument against it; he didn’t attempt to. It is because, like geocentrism, it had become obvious that no one could make logical positivism work, despite decades of brilliant scientists and philosophers trying.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_qz6gica" id="extra29_footnoteref9_qz6gica" title="Kuhn was in the right place at the right time. If he had published the same book thirty years earlier, it might have had much less impact, because logical positivism still seemed to be making progress.">9</a> Kuhn sketched an alternative that was radically different, plausible, and not known to be unworkable. And, it was easy to see how to fill in the details by doing more work of the sort he pioneered.</p>
<p>Kuhn had two big ideas. The first is that, if we want to know how science works, we need to look and see how people do it. That sounds obvious, and scientific. However, all previous attempts had been derived from <i>a priori</i> armchair theorizing about how, rationally, science <em>ought</em> to work. As soon you as compare those with reality, it’s obvious that they are totally false as accounts of how science <em>does</em> work. Somewhat less obviously, once you start to understand how science does work, you can see that rationalist ideas about how it <em>ought</em> to work are also wrong: it shouldn’t and couldn’t work that way.</p>
<p>By looking to see how science does work, Kuhn came to his second big idea. He found that science sometimes requires ontological remodeling, and that the type of reasoning scientists use for that is distinctively different from the type of reasoning they use when their ontology is adequate. During crisis periods, when an ontology breaks down, scientists evaluate, select, combine, modify, discover, and create alternatives. That is: “revolutionary science” requires meta-rational reasoning, whereas rationality is adequate for “normal science.”</p>
<p>Because he said that scientific progress depends on non-rational reasoning, Kuhn was widely misunderstood as advocating irrationalism—the only well-known alternative. Both his proponents and opponents jumped to the conclusion that, if he said scientific revolutions are not rational, he must mean they are intuitive, mystical, emotional, or political.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_qpzp4tl" id="extra29_footnoteref10_qpzp4tl" title="Intuition, mysticism, emotions, and politics do all play some role in most scientific revolutions—as they do in all human activity. They are not the way scientific revolutions produce better ontologies, though.">10</a> That led to heaps of harmful New Age woo.</p>
<p>Kuhn’s confusing presentation<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_1x8m6d0" id="extra29_footnoteref11_1x8m6d0" title="One major problem was that Kuhn used the word “paradigm” for several quite different concepts. Consequently, “paradigm shift” has come to mean anything, and therefore nothing. (“Ontological remodeling” is one of the phenomena Kuhn was pointing at, but he didn’t use that phrase.) Another problem was that he didn’t apply any unifying label to the various sorts of reasoning I’m calling “meta-rational.” He just pointed out specific examples and some patterns. If he had labeled the category, it would have been easier to understand what he was contrasting with rationality. It would have been harder to imagine it was mysticism. His 1969 Postscript to the second edition tried to fix these problems, but it was already too late. If you read the book, don’t skip the Postscript! In fact, it might be the best place to start.">11</a> also led to a horribly missed opportunity. Most scientists dismissed Kuhn’s observations. If he had explained them more clearly, scientists might have embraced them, and that might have led quickly to improved scientific practice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <cite>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</cite> was an instance of the thing it describes. It was a dramatic ontological remodeling of the scientific understanding of a domain of phenomena: in this case, science itself.</p>
<p>It is no longer credible to make theories about how science does or should work without taking into account detailed empirical evidence. It is no longer credible to claim that science is a solely rational activity. And there has been no serious attempt to construct a new rationalist account of science since Kuhn’s publication.</p>

<p>The planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)">Ceres↗︎︎</a> was discovered in 1801. It was found just where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titius%E2%80%93Bode_law">theory had predicted↗︎︎</a> there should be a planet, between Mars and Jupiter. Over the next few years, three more planets were found in the same region: Palas, Juno, and Vesta.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Planetary symbols" height="262" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/Bezeichnung_der_Himmelskörper_Encke_1850_187x262.gif" title="Planetary symbols" width="187"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">Planetary symbols, 1850</figcaption></figure>
<p>Vesta was the last new planet until the 1840s. Then, within a few years, there came a dozen more. Inventing new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols#Symbols_for_minor_planets">planetary symbols↗︎︎</a> for them became a headache. In 1851, that was resolved by giving them numbers instead. Ceres became object #1. But if they weren’t going to get planetary symbols, maybe they weren’t planets, even though they were “things that go around the sun,” which had been the meaning of “planet” since the heliocentric revolution. Anyway, they were small and boring, and who knows, there might be hundreds of them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_nsb4i9w" id="extra29_footnoteref12_nsb4i9w" title="A plausible hypothesis, but wrong. There are millions of asteroids, not hundreds. Probably billions, depending on where you arbitrarily cut off their lower size limit.">12</a> The whole lot got demoted to “asteroids.”</p>
<p>Ceres and the others ceased to be planets—but “planet” was not actually redefined. There was no specific criterion given for why they didn’t count. For the next century and a half, “planet” was implicitly defined just as a list: these eight things (and then nine, with Pluto) are the planets. They share some family resemblance, so that was an entirely reasonable solution—although not formally rational. There were no marginal cases, so there was no need for a rigorous classification scheme.</p>
<p>As Heidegger observed in the seminal meta-rational text <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B928VUE/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a>, we only resort to formal rationality when reasonableness becomes inadequate. Even for most routine science, reasonableness does the job much of the time. When that breaks down, in a crisis, you need to step back and get rational. If that too fails—as it did in 2006—you have to get meta-rational.</p>
<p>“Planet” started to break down in the 1990s, as numerous marginal cases were discovered: both outside and inside our solar system.</p>
<p>The first exoplanet—orbiting a star other than our sun—was discovered in 1992, and many more soon followed. But this made practical a problem that had previously only been theoretical. What sorts of things orbiting a star count as planets?</p>
<p>There’s only three kinds of things that go around our sun: rocks, clouds, and snowballs. There’s <em>all kinds</em> of weird things going around other stars: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_planet">gigantic diamonds↗︎︎</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">spacetime singularities↗︎︎</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutronium slag-heaps↗︎︎</a>, and who knows what all else. Which ones should count as planets, and why? That problem made everyone uneasy; but it still hasn’t come to a head, and remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there had long been reasons to think there might be more planets beyond Pluto, but none had been found. Starting also in 1992, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object">several pretty big things↗︎︎</a> were discovered out there. Should they count as planets?</p>
<p>Well, who cares? “It’s just a word…”</p>
<p>The International Astronomical Union cares, that’s who. They <em>have</em> to care, because in 1851 it was decided that non-planets get sequential object numbers, and planets don’t. It’s the IAU’s job to assign the numbers, and either the new things had to get them, or not. (This was a weird echo of Ceres being reclassified partly because of trouble with assigning new planetary symbols.) The IAU reached no decision for a decade.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue was forced by the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(dwarf_planet)">Eris↗︎︎</a>, named—deliberately—after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris is more massive than Pluto. If the argument for denying planetary status to the new things was that they weren’t big enough, relative to some arbitrary cut-off value, then either Eris is a planet, or Pluto isn’t.</p>
<p>The question became intensely political. Not only did some astronomers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/01/2006-space-oddity-pluto-debate-row">have passionate opinions↗︎︎</a>, so did the public. The public’s opinion was that they learned in school that Pluto was a planet, and who are these clueless ivory tower eggheads to say otherwise? It might be interesting to understand that irrationality better;<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_spkoka3" id="extra29_footnoteref13_spkoka3" title="Neil deGrasse Tyson wrote a book about this, The Pluto Files, with many quotations from the public debate. It’s a lot of fun, but doesn’t give much insight into why anyone cared.">13</a> but still more mysterious was the “rational,” “scientific” debate.</p>
<p>The problem was that there is no rational classification scheme that includes the nine traditional planets while excluding Eris and her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object">Trans-Neptunian↗︎︎</a> friends.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no rational classification scheme that includes the nine traditional planets, <em>period</em>. They have nothing in common. Jupiter, for instance, is a medium-sized cloud, whereas Earth is a small rock. (Jupiter is “medium-sized” inasmuch as equivalent objects outside the solar system can get thirteen times bigger before they reach the critical mass for deuterium fusion and become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf">brown dwarfs↗︎︎</a>—objects that can’t make up their minds about whether they are big planets or small stars. Earth is “small” inasmuch as Jupiter has 318 times its mass and 1,321 times its volume.)</p>
<p>You could say that planets are “big enough” things that go around the sun; but what should the size cut-off be? You can bite the bullet and exclude Eris by demoting Pluto—which, to be fair, is much smaller than the other eight traditional planets. But then you have to pick some arbitrary size threshold, which doesn’t seem very rational. If you are going to do that, a more rational cutoff might fall in the huge gap between the small rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and the big cloudy/snowy ones (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is another fairly natural size cutoff. Big enough objects collapse into a sphere, crushed by their own gravity. In 2005, as the crisis reached the boiling point, the most reasonable proposal was to define “planet” as “a sphere that goes around the sun.” This isn’t particularly rational, since it’s not clear why we should care either about going around the sun or sphericalness, but at least it’s concise.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Largest known Trans-Neptunian objects" height="406" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/EightTNOs_560x406.jpg" title="Largest known Trans-Neptunian objects" width="560"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">Image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EightTNOs.png">courtesy↗︎︎</a> Wikipedia user Lexicon</figcaption></figure>
<p>This proposal would have made Ceres a planet again—but not any of the other asteroids, because they aren’t quite big enough to collapse. It would also include Eris and half a dozen other spherical things beyond Pluto. I would have liked that, because they are cute. However, there may be hundreds of spheres out there, and in 2005—just as in 1851—many astronomers’ opinion was that having hundreds of planets is <em>not OK</em>.</p>
<p>So that proposal was rejected. Instead, in 2006, the IAU added a third criterion: to count as a planet, an object has to “clear the neighborhood around its orbit.” Eris and Pluto were declared to have failed to do so, and were made non-planets. Pluto, which we discovered had never <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss3')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a> been a planet after all, got a belated number: 134340.</p>
<p>The IAU did not define what “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood">clearing the neighborhood↗︎︎</a>” means. No planet has fully cleared its orbit; there’s lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_object">minor junk↗︎︎</a> in Earth’s neighborhood. Various complex mathematical definitions have since been suggested, all of which involve some arbitrary numerical cutoff for what counts as the neighborhood and how clear it has to be.</p>
<p>The 2006 definition put spherical things that go around the sun but don’t clear their neighborhoods—such as Ceres, Eris, and Pluto— in a newly invented category of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet">dwarf planets↗︎︎</a>.” Those are officially ABSOLUTELY NOT PLANETS, despite the name.</p>
<p>The word “dwarf” betrays the agenda here. What proponents really wanted was a size cutoff between Eris and Mercury, the smallest of the remaining “real planets.” That would preserve the traditional list as nearly as possible. However, there’s no rational reason for drawing a line there, so they came up with sciencey-sounding “clearing” criterion instead.</p>
<p>Ignored during the debate was what seems to me a serious bug. Jupiter <em>doesn’t go around the sun</em>, and therefore is not a planet by the 2006 definition.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? In Newtonian mechanics, two bodies orbit their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter">barycenter↗︎︎</a>, or center of mass. If they have equal masses, the barycenter is the midpoint between them. If one is heavier than the other, the barycenter is closer to it. If one has <em>much</em> greater mass than the other, their common barycenter is located within the larger body, and the smaller object goes around that point. Only then is the smaller body said to orbit the larger one. Otherwise, the two form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_system">binary system↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Jupiter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#Mass_and_size">ludicrously heavy↗︎︎</a>: it has 2.5 times the mass of everything else in the solar system combined, apart from the sun. The sun is much heavier still—but the barycenter of their mutual orbit is outside it. Jupiter and the sun are a binary system. Their barycenter is, to be fair, <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/">quite close↗︎︎</a> to the sun, and informally it may be reasonable to say Jupiter goes around it. But in terms of the formal definition, it doesn’t, so by the IAU criteria, Jupiter is not a planet.</p>
<p>Anyway, why is “goes around the sun” significant? If we’re interested in what’s <em>there</em>, we don’t care. “Goes around the sun” was meant to exclude large, spherical “moons,” seemingly just because they weren’t traditionally considered planets.</p>
<p>Jupiter is a useless blob, but its moons are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Habitability_potential">most likely places↗︎︎</a> to find extraterrestrial life. Ganymede, the largest, is bigger than Mercury; and several are compositionally similar to the rocky planets. Considered on their own, it would make better sense to group them with Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars than with snowball moons that aren’t much bigger than a breadbox.</p>
<p>The resulting ontology can only be described as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandered↗︎︎</a>.” Arbitrary boundaries were drawn to include and exclude particular objects, resulting in a contorted mess:</p>

<h3 id="extra29_lessons">Meta-rational lessons from a scientific failure</h3>
<p>The planetary definition controversy, and its outcome, were a farce—as is widely recognized.</p>
<p>It is a case study in ontological remodeling having failed due to people trying to use rational, rather than meta-rational, methods. “There <a href="#chap51">must be</a> a correct answer” is the characteristic error of <a href="#chap63">rationalist eternalism</a>.</p>
<p>The problem in classifying solar system objects is that there are different dimensions on which they vary. For example, you could group them by their history (how and where and when they formed), their current characteristics in isolation (size, composition, surface temperature), or their orbital dynamics (barycenter, eccentricity, “neighborhood clearing”). These axes would cluster objects quite differently.</p>
<p>There is no correct answer—or, the right answer depends on what question you are asking. If you are interested in dynamics, it doesn’t matter what an object is made of; if you are interested in astrobiology, it doesn’t matter where it came from.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality treats all categories as inherently purpose-laden—including scientific categories. It rejects the rationalist ideal of perfectly disinterested Truth. Any useful categorization of solar system objects would group them according to a sub-discipline’s interests. Dynamicists and astrobiologists would naturally come up with different ones.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality accepts, applies, and coordinates multiple ontologies for a single domain. There isn’t a great example in our solar system, but astrobiologists exploring other star systems might need to take dynamical considerations into account. Hopefully they would have no difficulty holding both classification schemes in their heads at once. Investigating the ruins of an ancient civilization on an unusual natural object in the Alpha Centauri system, they should not get sucked into arguments about whether it is “really” a planet.</p>
<p>By trying to force a single, purpose-free ontology onto the solar system, the IAU process came up with a classification that is entirely useless. The legacy planet/non-planet distinction, which the 2006 redefinition did its best to preserve, does not line up with <em>any</em> property we now care about. Implicitly, it amounts to “observable with the telescope technology of the 1700s.” This is a pattern: people get attached to categories for irrational reasons, and find spurious, “rational” justifications for them long after they have ceased to function.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality treats all category boundaries as inherently nebulous and malleable. It recognizes that there are always marginal cases. Those have to be dealt with pragmatically—taking into account context and purpose—because there is no rational standard.</p>
<p>The IAU process took for granted that there had to be a sharp, definite distinction between planets and non-planets. (Saying “this is dumb, it doesn’t matter” was not considered an option. Either Eris was going to get a number, or not.) To its credit, the IAU recognized that an arbitrary size cutoff was irrational. However, faced with marginal cases, there was no other “rational” solution. The arbitrary cutoff was hidden behind the figleaf of the “clearing” criterion.</p>
<p>The problem the IAU faced was not one of linguistic ambiguity. It was not a problem with words and definitions. “It’s just a word!” was not a solution. It was a problem of ontology: how do we divide up the world? Once a boundary is chosen and agreed on, sorting out words is usually easy. (Especially for scientists, who understand better than most people that we can give technical terms any meanings we want.) Sometimes people get attached to particular words, and sometimes arguments are genuinely linguistic. However, in most arguments supposedly about word meanings, the underlying issue is ontological: where do we draw a boundary?</p>
<p>The IAU was aiming for remodeling outcome #3: an improved, formal definition of an existing category. What they got was outcome #2: the category has disintegrated, and <em>de facto</em> has no formal status. It’s widely understood that the 2006 definition is pointless and silly. The process crystalized the recognition that there is no longer any meaningful, definite category called “planet,” and there never will be one again. On the other hand, it remains perfectly reasonable to talk about “planets” in other star systems—so long as you recognize that this is an informal usage. Outcome #2 melted the category, but it is not that “there is no such thing as a planet” or “planets don’t exist.”</p>

<p>Planetary science is now making extraordinary progress, without any meaningful definition. In 2006, almost nothing was known about Pluto besides its mass, diameter, and orbit. Last year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons">a space robot↗︎︎</a> sent back 6.25 gigabytes of information about it—and the discoveries are stunning. We now know far more about planets than when they were a (misleading) category. That knowledge depends on, and also implies, understanding the details of their heterogeneity.</p>
<p>We understand what each <em>specific</em> planet is vastly better than ever before. But we don’t have any <em>general</em> theory of planets, because they don’t have anything meaningfully in common (that other things don’t).</p>
<p>In the case of the planetary definition debacle, the various meta-rational lessons I’ve drawn here should be obvious—which shows that meta-rationality is not restricted to esoteric masters, but available to anyone with basic rationality skills.</p>
<p>Taking the same analysis to the meta level…</p>
<p>After the meta-rational remodeling of the rationalist categories “truth,” “belief,” and “reasoning,” we can understand <em>specific</em> instances much better than in the rationalist view. It is not that “there is no such thing as a truth” or “truth doesn’t exist.” But we can’t have any <em>general</em> theory of truths, because they don’t have anything meaningfully in common. Different, informal notions of truth apply in different situations. Meta-rationality looks at details to understand how “truth” operates in specific contexts, for specific purposes.</p>

It is simultaneously super geeky and admirably easy to read. He wrote it sixty years ago, and probably there’s been significant historical research in the mean time.

They thought, for spiritual reasons, that the universe <em>ought</em> to conform to simple mathematical rules; in their view Ptolemaic geocentrism was a godawful mess of kludges. The outstanding example was Kepler, whose heliocentrism was based on a Neoplatonic emanationist conviction that the Sun was God’s manifestation in the material realm, and therefore ought to be at the center of the universe. Fortuitously, his certainty that simple mathematical relationships must determine the cosmos led to his weird-but-true theory of elliptical orbits, which both dramatically simplified Copernicus’ system and gave much more accurate predictions. It also led to his elegant-but false theory that the distances between the planets related to the regular polyhedra. It’s interesting—but probably not significant—that the earliest advocates for what was later considered the first step in the Scientific Revolution were all woomeisters, who were right for the wrong reasons.</li>

At last I began to chafe that philosophers could by no means agree on any one certain theory of the mechanism of the Universe, wrought for us by a supremely good and orderly Creator, though in other respects they investigated with meticulous care the minutest points relating to its circles. I therefore took pains to read again the works of all the philosophers on whom I could lay hand to seek out whether any of them had ever supposed that the motions of the spheres were other than those demanded by the mathematical schools. I found first in Cicero that Hicetas had realized that the Earth moved [and so did various other ancients; Copernicus quotes them here]. Taking advantage of this I too began to think of the mobility of the Earth; and though the opinion seemed absurd, yet knowing now that others before me had been granted freedom to imagine such circles as they chose to explain the phenomena of the stars, I considered that I also might easily be allowed to try whether, by assuming some motion of the Earth, sounder explanations than theirs for the revolution of the celestial spheres might so be discovered.”</li>

Another problem was that he didn’t apply any unifying label to the various sorts of reasoning I’m calling “meta-rational.” He just pointed out specific examples and some patterns. If he had labeled the category, it would have been easier to understand <em>what</em> he was contrasting with rationality. It would have been harder to imagine it was mysticism. His 1969 Postscript to the second edition tried to fix these problems, but it was already too late. If you read the book, don’t skip the Postscript! In fact, it might be the best place to start.</li>

<h2 id="extra29_fundamental">Fundamental texts</h2>
<p>These are all brilliant, major works. Historians agree that they represented significant intellectual breakthroughs at the time.</p>
<p>Most are also extremely hard going. That is at least partly because their authors were working at the edge of what was thinkable at the time, and struggling to explain insights that were at the limits of the authors’ own understanding. In several cases, I recommend alternative, secondary sources that re-presented these breakthrough works in later eras, when the ideas had been worked through and became better understood. Reading the originals is valuable, but may prove impossible without a guide.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Nietzsche">Nietzsche</h3>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche introduced the problem of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>—the fundamental theme of <cite>Meaningness</cite>—to Western thought. It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that, ever since, the Continental branch of philosophy has consisted of working through Nietzsche’s ideas.</p>
<p>Nietzsche is fun and easy to read. Working at the edge of the thinkable, much of what he says is obviously wrong. It is often unclear whether he has made an actual mistake, or was joking, or was insane; or if he wasn’t sure—and didn’t care—whether he was serious.</p>
<p>I’ve read almost all his books, and recommend almost all of them, although his last few works are the best.</p>
<p>My favorite is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YI5BE0/?tag=meaningness-20">Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer↗︎︎</a>, which summarizes much of his thought. It is probably his most straightforward presentation of nihilism and eternalism. The single-page chapter “<a href="http://www.austincc.edu/adechene/Nietzsche%20true%20world.pdf">How the ‘True World’ finally became a fable↗︎︎</a>” is an intense summary of his summary—and also of the whole Western philosophical tradition and what is wrong with it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_2o05tlk" id="extra29_footnoteref1_2o05tlk" title="Because it’s highly condensed, it may be incomprehensible without some knowledge of the tradition. One key to understanding is that “Königsbergian” is a reference to Kant specifically. The supposed “true world” of Nietzsche’s stage 3 is Kant’s ding an sich, “the thing in itself.” That is the inaccessible “noumenon,” or true reality, as opposed to the defective “phenomenon” that appears to the senses. This is a catastrophically bad idea, which leads straight to nihilism.">1</a> He thought he was about to work out the solution to nihilism, and proclaimed it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bright day; breakfast; return of <i>bon sens</i> and cheerfulness; Plato’s embarrassed blush; pandemonium of all free spirits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately he had a total, permanent mental breakdown a few months later, and so never wrote up the answer.</p>
<p>Nietzsche’s most famous work is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B077LB19XG/?tag=meaningness-20">Thus Spake Zarathustra↗︎︎</a>, which is also the only one I <em>wouldn’t</em> recommend. It’s a tedious melodramatic parable, and the thinking is atypically muddled. People seem to like it because it’s a story.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Mipham">Mipham</h3>
<p>In Buddhist philosophy, the problem of nihilism and eternalism goes back a couple thousand years. I use Buddhism’s word “eternalism” because there’s nothing equivalent in Western philosophical language. That’s because eternalism has been Western thought’s main topic from the beginning. Fish have no word for water, and the two main Western ideologies—Christianity and rationalism—are both eternalistic. India had both eternalistic and nihilistic ideologies, and Buddhism positioned itself as the “neither of the above” alternative.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Buddhist analysis of nihilism and eternalism is a godawful mess. The first major author, Nagarjuna, was severely confused, but he was so extremely holy that you aren’t allowed to contradict him. So there’s two thousand years of brilliant thinkers trying to understand and explain the issues without quite saying that Nagarjuna got everything wrong. Despite that constraint, they made considerable progress over the centuries.</p>
<p>The Nyingma branch of Buddhism, to which I belong, considers Ju Mipham’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B6U16EC/?tag=meaningness-20">Beacon of Certainty↗︎︎</a> the definitive text. I think it gives a simple, obviously correct solution to the problem of eternalism and nihilism that Nietzsche first raised in the West. My original idea for <cite>Meaningness</cite> was to write a short, straightforward explanation of Mipham’s answer. I have failed spectacularly: <cite>Meaningness</cite> is several hundred thousand words so far, and is maybe 15% finished.</p>
<p>The <cite>Beacon of Certainty</cite> may be the most difficult book I’ve ever read. I absolutely do <em>not</em> recommend it—although I’m including it here because it <em>is</em> the root text for <cite>Meaningness</cite>. To make any sense of the <cite>Beacon</cite>, you need to have spent years studying less-difficult Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no less-difficult text I can recommend.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_kfg3uc4" id="extra29_footnoteref2_kfg3uc4" title="There are several books that claim to explain the Beacon. I haven’t read any of them all the way through, but I've skimmed the ones I could find, and I would not recommend any of them. They miss the point, as far as I could tell.">2</a> The whole field sucks. Your best bet is to get oral explanations from someone who has mastered it. They are sometimes willing to say things in person that they wouldn’t dare write.</p>
<p>Mipham and Nietzsche wrote their major works around the same time in the late 1800s. Their life stories and works are parallel in fascinating ways.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_34wkp5f" id="extra29_footnoteref3_34wkp5f" title="I would very much like to know whether Western thought was a significant influence on Mipham. There was much more Western cultural influence in Tibet at the time than is usually recognized—because, a bit later, both Tibetan conservatives and Western Romantics propagated the myth that Tibet was a special pure realm untouched by modernity. I've had to work hard to stop myself from digging into Mipham's personal intellectual history. It's not realistic that there was any direct influence between Mipham and Nietzsche in either direction, but it's not completely implausible that they developed independent, somewhat-similar responses to the same distinctively-modern conceptual problems.">3</a> They both wrote abstruse academic philosophy and they both wrote wild, prophetic, heterodox quasi-religious allegories. I wish I could introduce them to each other.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Heidegger">Heidegger</h3>
<p>Martin Heidegger’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B928VUE/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a> was the first and most important Western attempt to solve Nietzsche’s problem of nihilism and eternalism.</p>
<p>The first part of <cite>Being and Time</cite> analyzed <em>what life is like</em> in a completely new way, which I think points toward the solution. Heidegger abandoned the fundamental <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

He showed how life is structured instead by “circumspection,” a non-dual awareness in which everyday circumstances show up as always already meaningful in our interactions with them. This understanding of meaning as neither <a href="#chap78">objective nor subjective, but interactive</a> is fundamental to <cite>Meaningness</cite>.</p>
<p>Then Heidegger took a wrong turn. The further analysis of meaning he developed in the second half of the book was definitely mistaken (as he later acknowledged).</p>
<p><cite>Being and Time</cite> was probably the most influential philosophy book of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Jean-Paul Sartre completely misunderstood it and based his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671867806/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Nothingness↗︎︎</a> on his further distortion of Heidegger’s most-mistaken part. That was the root text for mid-20<sup>th</sup>-century <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'existentialism', 'gloss4')" title="In this book, existentialism means the stance that meaningness is subjective. In contrast, eternalism and nihilism both assume that meaningness must be objective. Usually existentialists also say meaning should be a purely individual creation: a perfectly free choice, possible only when you throw off all cultural assumptions and social pressures. That is not actually possible, and existentialism collapses into nihilism when you seriously attempt it. The complete stance is that all three are wrong: meaningness is neither subjective nor objective. It is a collaborative accomplishment of dynamic interaction. [Click for details.]">existentialism</a>, and a lot of subsequent pretentious and harmful intellectual nonsense. More productively, Michel Foucault—discussed below—mainly wrestled with Nietzsche’s and Heidegger’s problems.</p>
<p><cite>Being and Time</cite> is extremely hard going—up there with the <cite>Beacon of Certainty</cite>. I’d recommend reading Hubert Dreyfus’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YK4V0Y/?tag=meaningness-20">Being-in-the-World↗︎︎</a> first or instead. That is an explanation of the first, accurate part of Heidegger’s book. It’s not easy, but it’s much easier than <cite>Being and Time</cite> itself.</p>
<p>I’ve written about how Heidegger and Dreyfus influenced <cite>Meaningness</cite> briefly <a href="#extra5_AI">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein</h3>
<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote two main books. His first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019DFZVJM/?tag=meaningness-20">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus↗︎︎</a>, was one of the central texts of <dfn>logical positivism</dfn>—the major <a href="#chap63">rationalist-eternalist</a> movement of the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Later, he realized that couldn’t work, and wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1405159286/?tag=meaningness-20">Philosophical Investigations↗︎︎</a> to explain why. The book is probably the most influential in all of analytic philosophy. (The two major schools of 20<sup>th</sup> century Western philosophy were the Continental (French and German) and analytic (English-speaking) traditions.)</p>
<p>Working in parallel with Heidegger, but independently, Wittgenstein analyzed everyday practical activity, and came to the same conclusion. Meaning resides in interaction, rather than in our heads or in objects.</p>
<p>In a weird parallel, just as 20<sup>th</sup> century existentialism began as a drastic misunderstanding of <cite>Being and Time</cite>, analytic philosophy not only missed Wittgenstein’s main point, but has mostly promoted its exact opposite. <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> argues that language acquires its <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss5')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena.

Analytic philosophy has tended instead to attempt to eliminate nebulosity by taking language out of context, in order to figure out precisely what it should mean.

<p><cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> is difficult, but not impossible to read if you have a basic knowledge of 20<sup>th</sup> century philosophy. I don’t know of a good summary or introduction to it. (If you do, please leave a comment below!)</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Garfinkel">Garfinkel</h3>
<p>Harold Garfinkel founded the discipline called <dfn>ethnomethodology</dfn>, which is the empirical study of everyday practical activity. Like Heidegger and Wittgenstein, Garfinkel found that meaning lives in interaction. But whereas they derived their conclusions from informal reflection on personal experience, ethnomethodology observes other people doing meaningful things in meticulous detail—typically through obsessive analysis of video tapes. Particularly interesting for me are the many ethnomethodological studies of laboratory scientists running experiments.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s major work is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745600050/?tag=meaningness-20">Studies in Ethnomethodology↗︎︎</a>. It’s completely incomprehensible until you have got the main ideas from a less dense text by someone else. John Heritage’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745600611/?tag=meaningness-20">Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology↗︎︎</a> is the best introduction, although it’s still not easy, and does not cover all important aspects of the field. Lucy Suchman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/052167588X/?tag=meaningness-20">Plans and Situated Actions↗︎︎</a>—discussed <a href="#extra29_Suchman">below</a>—could be an alternative starting point, uniquely accessible to the STEM-educated, although it was not intended for the purpose.</p>
<p>Garfinkel was probably strongly influenced by Heidegger and Wittgenstein,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_u4wccrh" id="extra29_footnoteref4_u4wccrh" title="Since originally writing this, I’ve read more about his intellectual history, for example in Anne Rawls’ introduction to Ethnomethodology's Program: Working Out Durkheim's Aphorism. She makes a good case that Garfinkel’s insights were entirely independent of Wittgenstein’s; and that, while he studied the phenomenological school that included Heidegger, other members were bigger influences on him.">4</a> although he didn’t acknowledge that. He was a coyote trickster… Carlos Castaneda wrote his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671600419/?tag=meaningness-20">first↗︎︎</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AYIDRK8/?tag=meaningness-20">two↗︎︎</a> books of fictional psychedelic anthropology as his Bachelor’s and PhD theses under Garfinkel’s supervision. Some scholars believe Castaneda’s imaginary guru, the “Yaqui sorcerer” Don Juan Mateus, was based partly on Garfinkel. Don Juan advised Carlos to erase his personal history; Garfinkel seems to have followed that same advice, and it’s hard to figure out quite where his ideas came from.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_nti4nn4" id="extra29_footnoteref5_nti4nn4" title="Ixtlan, maybe.">5</a></p>
<p>It’s also hard to figure out quite where they went. Ethnomethodology imploded in the early 1990s, for reasons I only partly understand. I want to encourage its recent revival.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_meta">Meta-rationality</h2>
<p><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Rationalism', 'gloss6')" title="Rationalisms are ideologies that claim that there is some way of thinking that is the correct one, and you should always use it. Some rationalisms specifically identify which method is right and why. Others merely suppose there must be a single correct way to think, but admit we don?t know quite what it is; or they extol a vague principle like “the scientific method.” Rationalism is not the same thing as rationality, which refers to a nebulous collection of more-or-less formal ways of thinking and acting that work well for particular purposes in particular sorts of contexts. See also: meta-rationalism. [Click for details.]">Rationalism</a>, an eternalist ideology, is false, as Heidegger and Wittgenstein explained. However, formal rationality often works. Indeed, it’s <a href="#chap151">the basis of modern civilization</a>, and therefore hugely valuable and important. So how and when and why does rationality work? <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Meta-rationalism', 'gloss7')" title="Meta-rationality means thinking about and acting on rational systems from the outside, in order to use them more effectively. It evaluates, selects, combines, modifies, discovers, and creates rational methods. Meta-rationalism is an understanding of how and when and why rational systems work. It avoids taking them as fixed and certain, and thereby avoids both cognitive nihilism and rationalist eternalism. [Click for details.]">Meta-rationalism</a> is the empirical investigation of that question. It has found some preliminary answers.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Kuhn">Kuhn</h3>
<p>No one has read Thomas “Paradigm Shift” Kuhn’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007USH7J2/?tag=meaningness-20">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions↗︎︎</a> because everyone thinks they know what it says. It doesn’t say that.</p>
<p>Kuhn had two big ideas, as I discussed in “<a href="#chap184_revolution">A meta-scientific revolution</a>.” The first was that if you want to know how science works, you have to look and see what scientists do. Rationalist theories explain how science <em>ought</em> to work, according to armchair theorizing from first principles. But it doesn’t work like that at all. And once you understand how it <em>does</em> work, from empirical investigation, you can see that it couldn’t and shouldn’t work the way rationalism prescribes, either.</p>
<p>Kuhn’s second big idea was that science sometimes requires <a href="#chap184">ontological remodeling</a>, and the type of reasoning scientists use for that is quite different from the type of reasoning they use when their ontology is adequate. During crisis periods, when an ontology breaks down, scientists evaluate, select, combine, modify, discover, and create alternatives. “Revolutionary science” requires meta-rational thinking, whereas rationality is adequate for “normal science.”</p>
<p>Because he said that scientific progress depends on non-rational processes, Kuhn was widely misunderstood as advocating irrationalism—the only well-known alternative. In a Postscript, added in the second edition, he explains clearly the difference between his view and anti-rational relativism. If you read the book, don’t skip the Postscript! In fact, it might be the best place to start.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Schön">Schön</h3>
<p>Donald Schön’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B3M3KX8/?tag=meaningness-20">The Reflective Practitioner: How professionals think in action↗︎︎</a> is the closest thing we have to a manual of meta-rationality.</p>
<p>Schön observed in detail how experts in five technical fields addressed nebulous problems. He found that technical rationality—“the formulas learned in graduate school”—doesn’t cut it. Those methods only apply when a problem has already been well-characterized—that is, translated into a formal vocabulary. That is not what a civil engineer encounters in the field: what you find there is water and rocks and dirt, and it’s a mess. It’s not what a project manager encounters in a tech company: what you find there is a bunch of people squabbling about a slipped schedule, and it’s a mess. Rationality solves formal problems, but that’s not what expert professionals do. They transform nebulous messes.</p>
<p>Meta-rationality requires understanding the relationship between a particular clear-cut rational system and a particular messy, nebulous reality. The “solution” to a slipped schedule undoubtedly involves fiddling with a GANTT chart, or some similar project-management formalism. However, the mess can’t be “solved” entirely, or mainly, in this formal domain. The manager needs to understand how the GANTT chart relates to what people are actually doing.</p>
<p>There can be no <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fixed', 'gloss8')" title="Fixation is the psychological strategy of attaching spurious certainty and definiteness to pattern.  It is one defense against the anxiety provoked by nebulosity.  See also denial, the other defense. [Click for details.]">fixed</a> method for this; it’s inherently improvisational. That does not imply mystical intuitive woo. It means a lot of well-thought-out practical activity, immersing yourself in the mess, and <dfn>reflecting</dfn> on how specific rational methods could work in this concrete situation.</p>
<p>Mastery of professional practice is not the ability to solve cut-and-dried problems. That’s for junior staff, straight out of school. Professional mastery is the ability to re-characterize a nebulous real-world situation <em>as</em> a collection of soluble technical problems.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Kegan">Kegan</h3>
<p>Robert Kegan’s model of adult psychological development profoundly shapes my understanding of meta-rationality—as well as ethics, relationships, and society. I wrote about his work overall <a href="https://meaningness.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">here↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>His two major books are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003772KJC/?tag=meaningness-20">The Evolving Self↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674445880/?tag=meaningness-20">In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Kegan’s account of meta-rationality is frustratingly abstract, but his explanation of the ways it restructures the self gives insights not available elsewhere.</p>
<p>I’ll discuss Kegan’s work again below, in the sections on psychology and ethics.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_computation">Computation, AI, and cognitive “science”</h2>
<h3 id="extra29_Dreyfus">Dreyfus</h3>
<p>Hubert Dreyfus was both the foremost English-language Heidegger scholar and the most incisive critic of cognitive science, especially artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262540673/?tag=meaningness-20">What Computers Still Can’t Do↗︎︎</a> was the most recent in his series of explanations of how AI went wrong. His arguments were dismissed as idiotic philosophical misunderstandings by the field for decades, but were mainly proven correct by time. It was AI that was an idiotic philosophical misunderstanding…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YK4V0Y/?tag=meaningness-20">Being-in-the-World↗︎︎</a>, which I mentioned earlier as a guide to Heidegger’s <cite>Being and Time</cite>, also explained in detail how Heidegger’s understanding of everyday activity refutes cognitive “science.” (I put the word “science” in quotes to indicate that the field’s overall program was not scientific, but ideological, mistaken, and harmful. Lots of good and genuine science was done under the rubric “cognitive science” despite that.)</p>
<p>Dreyfus’ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UYURT2/?tag=meaningness-20">All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age↗︎︎</a>, written with Sean Dorrance Kelly, has nothing to do with AI, but it’s much easier to read than his other books. It’s an inquiry into the problem of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss9')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

<h3 id="extra29_Suchman">Suchman</h3>
<p>Lucy Suchman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/052167588X/?tag=meaningness-20">Plans and Situated Actions↗︎︎</a> is a remarkable cross-disciplinary synthesis. Originally trained in anthropology, Suchman also studied ethnomethodology, was a student of Hubert Dreyfus, and had thoroughly assimilated Heidegger’s account of everydayness and Dreyfus’ critique of cognitivism.</p>
<p>But she worked at Xerox PARC. In the 1970s, essentially all the elements of modern computer systems were either invented at PARC, or given their first practical implementation there. (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UUSAGE/?tag=meaningness-20">Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, then Ignored, the First Personal Computer↗︎︎</a> for a history.) PARC’s visionary director John Seely Brown then built an AI and cognitive science team that surpassed all but the top few university programs of the time.</p>
<p>So Suchman also learned to think and talk like a cognitive scientist, which made her uniquely positioned to bridge the conceptual gap between rationalist and situated accounts of practical activity. Her book was the biggest direct influence on my PhD thesis work, and much of my understanding of everydayness I owe to her.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Xerox bet its future on a physically huge, incredibly expensive, and vastly complicated new office copier. Unfortunately, no one could figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>AI to the rescue! Some of the foremost experts in AI action theory developed an intelligent user interface / tutoring system that told you exactly what you needed to do.</p>
<p>Suchman filmed famous cognitive scientists trying to use it… and the bafflement and swearing that ensued. If you remember Microsoft’s rage-inducing Clippy The Intelligent Office Assistant, you can imagine the scene.</p>
<p>By careful analysis of what went wrong in their interactions with the system, she showed how breakdowns were consequences of mistaken rationalist assumptions, and how they could be understood in terms of ethnomethodological conversation analysis.</p>
<p>Suchman’s relatively STEM-friendly language made philosophically sophisticated theories of action available to computer professionals. That changed the course of AI research. <cite>Plans and Situated Actions</cite> was even more influential in the fields of human-computer interaction and user experience design.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Agre">Agre and Chapman</h3>
<p>As I recounted in “<a href="#extra5">I seem to be a fiction</a>,” Phil Agre and I eventually <em>got</em> Dreyfus’ critique of AI, with Lucy Suchman’s help. In the late 1980s, together we set about reforming the field to incorporate their insights.</p>
<p>Agre’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521386039/?tag=meaningness-20">Computation and Human Experience↗︎︎</a> is the overall best account of his work, and of our joint work. It’s a unique masterpiece. Like Suchman’s book, it’s a synthesis of Continental philosophy, empirical ethnomethodology, and deep insights into what can and cannot be computed by brains—but in Agre’s book, there’s code too.</p>
<p>My book on our work was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262031817/?tag=meaningness-20">Vision, Instruction, and Action↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>A brief theoretical overview was “<a href="#extra20">Abstract Reasoning as Emergent from Concrete Activity</a>,” available on this site.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Winograd">Winograd and Flores</h3>
<p>In the late 1960s, Terry Winograd designed SHRDLU, perhaps the most impressive AI system of all time. In the mid-’80s, he recognized that Dreyfus’ critique was mainly correct.</p>
<p>The first half of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201112973/?tag=meaningness-20">Understanding Computers and Cognition↗︎︎</a>, written with Fernando Flores, is a short, clear meta-rational account of human activity. It is written for the STEM-educated, and may well be the best overall introduction if that’s you. For some readers, it may be a bit <em>too</em> short, with not quite enough detail to enable you to grasp meta-rationality.</p>
<p>(The second half of the book is based on speech act theory, a rationalist account of language that seems to clash with the meta-rationalism of the first half.)</p>
<p>I took the title of my book <cite><a href="#chap180">In the Cells of the Eggplant</a></cite> from a dialog in <cite>Understanding Computers and Cognition</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A. Is there any water in the refrigerator?<br/>
B. Yes.<br/>
A. Where? I don't see it. <br/>
B. In the cells of the eggplant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was “there is water in the refrigerator” true?</p>
<p>That question can only be answered meta-rationally: “True in what sense? Relative to what purpose?”</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Smith">Smith</h3>
<p>Brian Cantwell Smith is the foremost philosopher of computation. Actually, as far as I know, he is the <em>only</em> philosopher of computation. “Philosophy of Computation” is a field that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>“Right—because Church and Turing said everything that can be said about that!” Nope.</p>
<p>What is a computer? A computer is a machine that <dfn>means</dfn> things. If you fight your way through six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD screens↗︎︎</a> on a hotel reservation site, you reach a web page that <em>means</em> you have reserved a room on Woolloomooloo Wharf next weekend. If it doesn’t mean that, the page is meaningless and you will be greatly discommoded when you arrive and find the hotel is sold out.</p>
<p>Computers are meaning machines—and you will notice that our existing Theory of Computation, which derives from Church’s and Turing’s work, has nothing at all to say about meaning.</p>
<p>Cognitive science assumed that brains are computers, more-or-less, and that brains and computers mean things the same way. How? Philosophers of mind assumed that AI guys knew how computers mean things—but we didn’t. We assumed that the philosophers of mind knew—but they didn’t. Once Smith (originally an AI guy) realized this disconnect, he set out to figure out how computers do mean things. Which turns out not to be easy; but he’s still making progress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262692090/?tag=meaningness-20">On the Origin of Objects↗︎︎</a> is his first major report. One observation central to <cite>Meaningness</cite>, and to pretty much every work in this reading list, is that <a href="#chap95">objects are not objectively separable</a>. Yet meanings are <em>about</em> objects—Woolloomooloo Wharf, for instance. The objectness of the wharf is not inherent to it, but arises during your interactions with it. <cite>On the Origin of Objects</cite> includes an account of how. My account will be somewhat different—but Smith is one of the few people to ask the question clearly, and to offer a serious and detailed proposal.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Hofstadter">Hofstadter</h3>
<p>Douglas Hofstadter’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465026567/?tag=meaningness-20">Gödel, Escher, Bach↗︎︎</a> is a uniquely playful exploration of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Much of the book is presented in the form of comic dialogs between characters taken from Lewis Carroll. (Plus Terry Winograd, who appears as “Dr. Tony Earwig.”) But it also asks serious and deep questions about the nature of intelligence and computation, and gives insightful answers unlike those proposed by anyone else.</p>
<p>I don’t think Hofstadter’s overall approach was at all right, but all other known AI approaches also look like dead ends to me. If I were forced to choose one to work on, his might be the least unpromising.</p>
<p>I discussed some of Hofstadter’s best ideas in “<a href="#extra13">A first lesson in meta-rationality</a>.”</p>

<p>Roy Baumeister’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0898625319/?tag=meaningness-20">Meanings of Life↗︎︎</a> is the project most similar to <cite>Meaningness</cite> in subject matter. It’s an exploration of the ways people think about the same <a href="#chap22">set of topics I cover</a>—purpose, value, self, ethics, sacredness, and so on.</p>
<p>I was annoyed all the way through it, because he says many things I was going to say, which I thought I had thought of first, and which I still haven’t had time to write up.</p>
<p>Mostly, he does not attempt to resolve these problems. <cite>Meaningness</cite> does. Or will. Any decade now.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Kramer">Kramer and Alstad</h3>
<p>Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WL0JHE/?tag=meaningness-20">The Guru Papers↗︎︎</a> was mis-named. It discusses gurus only in passing.</p>
<p>Their book is a sprawling but brilliant discussion of the major topics of <cite>Meaningness</cite>—unity and diversity, self and other, sacred and profane, life-purpose, ethics, ultimate value, and so on. It is a memetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosology">nosology↗︎︎</a>—a classification of contagious harmful ideas, attitudes, and practices.</p>
<p>I wrote a brief introduction, plus extensive quotes, <a href="#extra4">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Kegan_psychology">Kegan, again</h3>
<p>Robert Kegan’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003772KJC/?tag=meaningness-20">The Evolving Self↗︎︎</a> is the most sophisticated explanation I’ve found of the ways we relate self and other, and the ways we relate to our selves.</p>
<p>The book strikes many readers as a major revelation. It’s not only intellectually fascinating, making sense of so much of our lives—it’s also useful in practice as a guide to radical personal transformation.</p>
<p>Other readers find nothing meaningful in it. Tentatively, I suspect that’s not because they miss the point, but because Kegan’s framework simply doesn’t apply to everyone.</p>
<p>I wrote a detailed summary <a href="https://meaningness.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">here↗︎︎</a>.</p>

<p>George Ainslie’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FOPTXI/?tag=meaningness-20">Breakdown of Will↗︎︎</a> is one of the best books I know on what it means to be a self.</p>
<p><a href="#chap104">Selves are inherently nebulous</a>. They begin as incoherent masses of conflicting impulses. We are functional to the extent that we can get those to agree to head in the same general direction most of the time, and not constantly sabotage each other. Kegan’s book is one account of how to do that. Ainslie’s is another. Their perspectives are extremely different, but—I think—compatible.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Bly">Bly</h3>
<p>Robert Bly’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062548476/?tag=meaningness-20">A Little Book on the Human Shadow↗︎︎</a> is another outstanding explanation of what it means to have a self. Again, the question is how to resolve internal conflicts. It’s written from an extremely different point of view (Jungian folklore interpretation) than Ainslie’s (mathematical game theory) and Kegan’s (Piagetian developmental psychology).</p>
<p>The <cite>Little Book</cite> was the basis for my nine-part series on “Eating the Shadow,” which begins <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/we-are-all-monsters">here↗︎︎</a>. It was also a major influence on my <a href="http://buddhism-for-vampires.com/dark-culture">series on dark culture↗︎︎</a>. Eventually I’ll present the same material quite differently in <cite>Meaningness</cite>.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Miller’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0023SDQFI/?tag=meaningness-20">Spent: Sex, Evolution, and Consumer Behavior↗︎︎</a> explains how vast swathes of everyday activity are unconsciously devoted to advertising our personal qualities to others—rather than enjoying ourselves or making ourselves useful. It’s a fast, fun read, and you will discover things about yourself that are simultaneously horrifying and humorous.</p>

<p>Nearly everything that has been written about ethics, whether from a religious or secular rationalist point of view, is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss11')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalistic</a>. That is, it assumes that there <a href="#chap51">must be</a> some correct system of ethics that defines what is morally right. That assumption is mistaken and harmful: there obviously is no such system currently, and there are good reasons to believe there never can be one.</p>
<p>A very few people claim to be ethical nihilists, but they are either trolling or confused.</p>
<p>Only a handful of thinkers have tried to work out non-eternalist, non-nihilist accounts of ethics. The mostly-unwritten <a href="#chap127">ethics chapter</a> of <cite>Meaningness</cite> will develop this possibility.</p>
<p>So far, my most extensive writing on ethics has been a <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/09/23/buddhist-ethics-is-a-fraud/#summary">debunking of the modern Buddhist version↗︎︎</a>. That series of posts does also include <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/11/27/emptiness-form-and-dzogchen-ethics/">positive proposals↗︎︎</a>, summarizing the <cite>Meaningness</cite> ethical approach, however.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Nietzsche_ethics">Nietzsche, again</h3>
<p>Nietzsche wrote extensively on ethics. In the popular imagination, he was a nihilist and therefore wicked, but in fact he rejected nihilism. His ethical thinking pointed at a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss12" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss12')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.

<p>Among his ethical works, I recommend <cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite> and <cite>The Genealogy of Morals</cite>. Confusingly, there are now many English translations of each. I read the ones by Walter Kaufmann, the only ones available at the time. Both are included in the collection <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004KABEBU/?tag=meaningness-20">Basic Writings of Nietzsche↗︎︎</a>, a bargain at $3.99 on Kindle. The more recent translations may be better; I don’t know.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Kegan_ethics">Kegan, again again</h3>
<p>Robert Kegan’s work began as an extension of Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of moral development. I think Kegan’s <a href="https://meaningness.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">stage 5↗︎︎</a> is the most sophisticated ethical framework available. It requires meta-rationality: relating different ethical systems to each other, and reflecting on their relationship with reality.</p>
<p>Among his several books, only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003772KJC/?tag=meaningness-20">The Evolving Self↗︎︎</a> discusses ethics.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Buckingham">Buckingham</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1899999485/?tag=meaningness-20">Finding Our Sea-Legs: Ethics, Experience and the Ocean of Stories↗︎︎</a>, Will Buckingham writes that “we have always been at sea” when it comes to ethics. For thousands of years, philosophers and prophets have proclaimed the possibility of finding land: solid ground. But no one has ever reached any.</p>
<p>It is time, he says, to turn away from that eternalistic fantasy of ethical <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>. Instead, we can make genuine progress in our actual, groundless situation. Metaphorically, we can learn to be better navigators. We can study the winds and the waves and the stars; and can learn to steer around shoals, thunderstorms and whirlpools, guiding our ships into calmer waters where we can gaze at the sea and the sky and watch fish play.</p>
<p>When we recognize that ethics can only ever be a nebulous muddle—but is no less important for that—we can work together to resolve difficulties “with all the kindness, patience, and care that we can muster.” Buckingham concludes that “there is no way out” of the ocean, yet ethics offers “not an intolerable burden” but “the possibility of joy.”</p>

<h3>Seligman</h3>
<p>Adam Seligman, working with other authors, has made major contributions to the understanding of nebulosity, porous boundaries, and meta-rationality, specifically in the political realm.</p>
<p>The two books of his I know are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199915288/?tag=meaningness-20">Rethinking Pluralism: Ritual, Experience, and Ambiguity↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001949SG8/?tag=meaningness-20">Ritual and Its Consequences↗︎︎</a>. I reviewed <cite>Ritual</cite> <a href="https://meaningness.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/ritual-vs-mentalism/">here↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Foucault">Foucault</h3>
<p>Michel Foucault was the most important philosopher in the lineage of Nietzsche and Heidegger. <a href="#extra17_foucault_video">Unfortunately</a>, his deliberate obscurity has allowed tendentious idiots to misuse his subtle ideas in support of simplistic political agendas.</p>
<p>The best introduction to his work may be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R4FQDNW/?tag=meaningness-20">Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics↗︎︎</a>, by Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Foucault’s premature death (of AIDS) prevented what might have become a complete meta-rational presentation. His last work—the multi-volume, unfinished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0679724699/?tag=meaningness-20">History of Sexuality↗︎︎</a>—is the best. It’s only incidentally about sexuality; it’s about self and society, knowledge and power, language and experience.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Lyotard">Lyotard</h3>
<p>Jean-François Lyotard’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816611734/?tag=meaningness-20">The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge↗︎︎</a> is one of the two root texts for postmodernism. Knowing this, you might not suspect that it was commissioned by the government of Quebec as a report on the influence of information technology on the exact sciences. Written in 1979, it’s astonishingly prophetic about the then-future impact of the internet—but that is not the reason to read it. You might also not suspect that, unlike the voluminous obscurantist blather of later postmodernists, it’s only 70 pages and reasonably clearly written.</p>
<p>Lyotard’s main topic is the <a href="#chap153">breakdown of the systematic worldview</a> in the face of nebulosity, and the persistence of multiple, functional, partial systems despite that. He aims for “a politics that would respect both the desire for justice [pattern] and the desire for the unknown [nebulosity].” This remains unfulfilled, and obstructed not least by the subsequent development of postmodernism—but I think still a worthy goal.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_Hobsbawm">Hobsbawm</h3>
<p>Eric Hobsbawm’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E3URF5Q/?tag=meaningness-20">The Invention of Tradition↗︎︎</a>, about fake history, is both insightful and very funny, in a dry and British way. I discussed it <a href="#chap152">here</a>.</p>
<ul class="footnotes"><li class="footnote" id="extra29_footnote1_2o05tlk"><a class="footnote-label" href="#extra29_footnoteref1_2o05tlk">1.</a> Because it’s highly condensed, it may be incomprehensible without some knowledge of the tradition. One key to understanding is that “Königsbergian” is a reference to Kant specifically. The supposed “true world” of Nietzsche’s stage 3 is Kant’s <i>ding an sich</i>, “the thing in itself.” That is the inaccessible “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noumenon">noumenon↗︎︎</a>,” or true reality, as opposed to the defective “phenomenon” that appears to the senses. This is a catastrophically bad idea, which leads straight to nihilism.</li>

There was much more Western cultural influence in Tibet at the time than is usually recognized—because, a bit later, both Tibetan conservatives and Western Romantics propagated the myth that Tibet was a special pure realm untouched by modernity. I've had to work hard to stop myself from digging into Mipham's personal intellectual history. It's not realistic that there was any direct influence between Mipham and Nietzsche in either direction, but it's not completely implausible that they developed independent, somewhat-similar responses to the same distinctively-modern conceptual problems.</li>

concepts in this book.  They are closely related to the Buddhist
notions of <a href="http://arobuddhism.org/emptiness.html">↗︎︎</a>.  For several reasons, I've chosen not to use
“emptiness” and “form,” and invented these new terms instead.</p>
<p>First, “emptiness” in English has a common usage with regard to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss2')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.

Emptiness in this sense is an emotional correlate of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>, or the
perception of meaninglessness.  “Emptiness” in Buddhist philosophy means
something different.  Worse, what it means is <i>related</i> to the Western use,
but in a complex way.  Talking about Buddhist emptiness in a non-Buddhist
context seems bound to cause confusion.</p>
<p>Second, the Buddhist philosophy of emptiness and form is famously
contentious.  Various Buddhist schools each have their own explanations, and
vitriolically attack each others’ interpretations.  I don’t want to take sides
in these battles.  I also don’t want to argue about whether my own understanding
or explanation of emptiness and form is correct (according to the standards of
some Buddhist school or other).</p>
<p>Third, the philosophy of emptiness and form is also famously obscure.  It is
so abstract and vague that it is hard to know whether the divergent
interpretations are actually discussing the same thing, or if they talk past one
another because they discuss different topics.  It is hard to know whether any
of the writers in the field are talking about anything at all, or whether they
are discussing something purely imaginary.  It is hard to know how one could
know which of the accounts is right, or even what it would mean for them to be
right or wrong.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_4sr7819" id="extra29_footnoteref1_4sr7819" title="As it happens, I do have opinions about these questions.  I may present them somewhere, someday; but I’m unsure that it would be useful.  In any case, it’s a topic that doesn’t belong on this web site.">1</a></p>
<p>As a result, it is unclear whether “nebulosity and pattern,” as I use the
words here, are the same thing as someone’s version of “emptiness and form,” or
not.  My concepts are influenced
particularly by the <a href="https://approachingaro.org/aro-gter-emptiness">Aro
gTér explanations of emptiness and form↗︎︎</a>; but I am uncertain whether
they are identical.</p>
<p>I think that it is probably possible to give completely clear and precise
explanations of “nebulosity” and “pattern.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_69us1du" id="extra29_footnoteref2_69us1du" title="Clear and precise enough for analytic philosophy.  Some math would be required—enough to impress analytic philosophers.">2</a> This might be useful to the philosophy of emptiness and form.
Even for someone who believes “nebulosity and pattern” are different from
emptiness and form, they are sufficiently similar that a clear account of one
might clarify the other.  It might at minimum serve as a challenge to Buddhist
philosophers to formulate a comparably clear account.</p>
<p>But I am not going to do that in this book.  This book is meant for a general
readership, for whom a lengthy discussion of exactly what “nebulosity” and
“pattern” mean would be a distraction.  (Never mind a discussion of how they
relate to the various Buddhist theories of emptiness—interesting as that might
be to some.)</p>

everything at once…</p>

Buddhism often describes the resolution of this opposition as “non-duality.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=non-duality">A quick Google search↗︎︎</a> shows that, in current English, “non-duality” is almost always used to mean something different.  Mostly, “non-dual” refers to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

In this book, I argue that monism is wrong, and that the main reason people adopt it is because it appears that dualism is the only alternative.</p>
<p>Using “non-dualism” to mean “monism” actively hides other possibilities.</p>
<p>Potentially there may be many different alternatives to dualism, of which monism is only one.  (This book <a href="#chap103">advocates another</a>.)  It would be useful if all such alternatives could be described as “non-dualistic.”  It is probably too late for that; “non-dual” is well-established as meaning “monist.”</p>
<p>“Non-dual” appears to have entered the English language as a direct translation of the Sanskrit word <i>advaita</i>,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_sbo84un" id="extra29_footnoteref1_sbo84un" title="A- means “not,” as in “atheist”; dva is “two,” cognate with “dual”; -ita is “-ity.”  Sometimes the close historical relationship between Indian and European languages is obvious.">1</a> as used in Hindu philosophy.

<p>All these ideas are probably familiar. Many are <em>almost</em> right, and perhaps none is entirely wrong. They do incorporate important insights.  It is not an accident that they dominated university philosophy departments during the Nineteenth Century.  They are central themes of the German Romantic Idealist movement.</p>
<p>They may have a whiff of the New Age about them. But they seem now to be <a href="#extra2">increasingly accepted by masses of people</a> who wouldn’t get anywhere near the New Age, and do not know or care where the ideas came from.</p>
<p>Historical research suggests that Romantic Idealism is, indeed, the primary basis for current pop spirituality.  I will trace the complex history of this—I am not sure in how much detail—in future posts.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism">Transcendentalism↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought">New Thought↗︎︎</a> were two key points in the lineage of transmission, along with the New Age of course.  Similar ideas can be found elsewhere, particularly in Hindu <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta">Advaita Vedanta↗︎︎</a>.  There has been direct influence of Advaita on Western mass thinking today; but the German connection is greater.)</p>
<p>Historical interest aside, the pressing question is why these ideas are popular now, and what to do about it.</p>

<p class="intro_para">Eckhart Tolle’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452289963/?tag=meaningness-20">A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose↗︎︎</a> has sold several million copies. I suspect it is the biggest single influence on the <a href="#extra11">“spiritual but not religious”</a> trend that is <a href="#extra2">bringing monism to the mainstream</a>.</p>
<p>It deserves its success.  It is brilliant: simple, clear, elegant, friendly; and mostly—I find—wise.  Unfortunately, woven all through it, there is a terrible error.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2>A superficial mash-up?  No.</h2>
<p>Not everyone is as impressed with the book as I am. The usual criticism is that it is a superficial mash-up of spiritual platitudes from many familiar sources.  This, I think, is quite wrong—although an understandable mistake.</p>
<p><i>A New Earth</i> is not superficial at all.  Tolle explains core <a href="https://approachingaro.org/principles-and-functions">principles and functions↗︎︎</a> from two major spiritual systems.  He has thought these through and understood them exceptionally thoroughly.  The book is dense: every page has at least one significant idea. There is none of the usual self-help filler.</p>
<p>Tolle’s explanations are simple.  I think that it is a <em>good</em> thing, although perhaps it gives the impression that his ideas are light-weight.  He goes straight to the heart of the matter, without getting lost in complex concepts.  He explicitly does not teach a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'system', 'gloss0')" title="“Systems,” in this book, are conceptual, methodological, and institutional structures that make claims about meaningness.  These include, for instance, religions, philosophies, political ideologies, and psychological frameworks. A system includes a structure of justification, which explains why you should believe its claims, and typically grounds in an eternal ordering principle. I contrast systems with stances, which are much simpler attitudes toward meaningness. [Click for details.]">system</a>, with all the dogmatic beliefs, jargon, history, and rituals that go with those.  People are used to the idea that difficult intellectual theories are the mark of profundity; I think that is quite wrong.</p>
<p>It is also not true that <i>A New Earth</i> is a mash-up of many religious traditions.  This mistake can be forgiven, because Tolle goes out of his way to make it seem as though it is.  For example, he quotes the New Testament once every couple of pages.</p>
<p>That is, I think, a deliberate misdirection.  I can find no meaningful influence of Christianity in the book.  Tolle probably put the Bible stuff in to reassure culturally-Christian readers that he’s not a Satanist or foreigner or something.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_8n176km" id="extra29_footnoteref1_8n176km" title="In fact, it appears that he is converting many Christians to monism.  Those converts probably mostly do not recognize that monism is incompatible with the core Christian principles of sin and salvation, and that they are no longer Christians.  (If you yourself are God, you cannot rely on an external god for salvation, nor are you capable of sin.  I will discuss this in detail in my section on the dualist critique of monism.)  If I were a Christian minister, I would be panicking about Tolle’s influence.">1</a></p>
<p>I see only two significant sources for Tolle’s ideas.  One is Buddhism, which is dominant, and which Tolle often explains magnificently.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_62iralu" id="extra29_footnoteref2_62iralu" title="He rarely credits Buddhism, however.  I assume that this is because he believes that “Buddhism” as a religion is unacceptable to the mainstream, whereas some of its actual content is attractive. I think he is right about this.">2</a></p>
<p>The other is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss1')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth.

That’s arguably a third source, but it’s restricted to one section of the book.">3</a>  Monist eternalism is maybe a quarter of the book.  It is what I called the “terrible error woven all through.”</p>
<h2 id="extra29_selling">Selling Oneness</h2>
<p>Monist eternalism seems like it ought to be hard to sell.  One of its core claims is:</p>
<blockquote><p>You think you are Tyler Smith, 27 years old, gay, a web designer, living with your boyfriend in a one-bedroom apartment in Seattle.  But you are wrong.  <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Really', 'gloss3')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">Really</a>, you are the entire universe.  Also, you are God.</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious reply to that is:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, that’s totally stupid.  I <em>am</em> Tyler Smith.  I’m quite sure; it says so on my birth certificate.  And the whole universe wouldn’t fit in our apartment.  When we moved in, the place didn’t even have enough room for our combined stuff.  And, if I were God, I would know about it.  God is supposed to know everything, right?</p></blockquote>
<p>You sell monist eternalism by pointing out its alluring benefits:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since you are God, you are immortal, all-powerful, and can stop worrying about the work project that’s behind schedule and whether your boyfriend is thinking of leaving or what.</p></blockquote>
<p>The trick is to get that hook in while somehow neutralizing the “yeah, but I’m not God” reaction.</p>
<p>There are two traditional approaches to that.  One is to invent a complicated explanation that supposedly proves that everyone <em>is</em> God, despite all evidence to the contrary.  This line was perfected by <a href="#extra1">Idealist philosophers</a> two hundred years ago.  It is <a href="http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2008/04/28/ken_wilber">still used by Ken Wilber↗︎︎</a>, for instance; and similar intellectual obfuscation is used in <a href="#extra27">New Age monism</a>.  It doesn’t work on most people, though.  Your victim has to consider themselves smart enough that they believe they can follow the complicated explanation, but not actually <em>be</em> smart enough to figure out that it’s nonsense.</p>
<p>The other traditional approach is to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am extremely holy and wise, as you can see because I wear a white robe and talk in a <a href="https://approachingaro.org/special">special↗︎︎</a>, <a href="https://approachingaro.org/no-holiness-vastness">holy↗︎︎</a> way.  In fact, I am God; so you have to believe what I say.  And I say: you are God too.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a common Hindu approach.  It works only on the gullible and desperate.  Most people will reply</p>
<blockquote><p>I can put on a bathrobe and talk funny, too, but that doesn’t make me God.  Or you, either.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between these two approaches combined, only maybe ten percent of Westerners are vulnerable.</p>
<h2>The Big Lie</h2>
<p>Eckhart Tolle has developed a new way to sell monist eternalism.</p>
<p>This is the “Big Lie” approach:</p>
<p style="padding-left:2em"><i>If you repeat an obvious falsehood often enough, with complete conviction and no attempt at defense, people will eventually come to believe it.</i></p>
<p>Tolle never gives any reason to believe the obviously wrong things he says, nor ever attempts to counter the natural objections.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_bdkl0yj" id="extra29_footnoteref4_bdkl0yj" title="This is not completely true.  He has a one-page “incontrovertible proof” that you are immortal (pp. 127-8), and a one-page explanation of why it appears you are not the entire universe when in fact you are (p. 276).  But these are brief and half-assed.">4</a>  He just states absurdities as if they were plainly true; as though you will surely accept them if you try them on for a moment or two.</p>
<p>What held back earlier monist manifestations, such as the New Age, was the specifics of the systems.  Monism was available only as the background world-view of complex belief systems.  The specifics of these systems generally included beliefs and practices <a href="#extra27_problem">most people consider stupid</a>.</p>
<p>Tolle has developed <a href="#extra11">system-free monism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is arising now is not a new belief system, a new religion, spiritual ideology, or mythology.  We are coming to the end not only of mythologies but also of ideologies and belief systems.  (<i>A New Earth</i>, p. 21)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, this works.  My impression (based on severely sketchy evidence, so take this lightly) is that the fraction of Americans who buy into monist eternalism has gone from a tenth to a quarter in the five years since <i>A New Earth</i> was published.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_9km8oka" id="extra29_footnoteref5_9km8oka" title="It seems that around a quarter of Americans are “spiritual but not religious”; I cited some studies to this effect on the previous page.  I’m not sure what fraction of those are monists, but I think it is most. My estimate that a tenth of Americans were monists five years ago is strictly a guess. ">5</a>  Tolle can’t be the only reason, but I suspect he is the biggest single one.</p>
<h2>Raising my game</h2>
<p>It is easy to <a href="#extra27">make fun of the New Age</a>, which until recently was the main reservoir of monism.  That’s shooting fish in a barrel.</p>
<p>A serious critique of <i>A New Earth</i> would be much more difficult; but also much more useful.  Tolle presents monism clearly, simply, and elegantly.  That demands a clear, simple, elegant rebuttal.  A successful reply would not only clarify the issues for those it persuades to reject monism; it also would help committed monists understand what they’ve signed up for.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to respond to Tolle, because you can’t attack his arguments or evidence.</p>
<p>He doesn’t make any arguments; he simply states his beliefs as unquestionable, eternal Truths.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help to point out that what he says is factually false.  Its falsity is obvious, but factual untruth doesn't bother monists.  For monism, specifics (and the material world) are unimportant.  What matters is the abstract, the general, and the realm of Spirit.</p>
<p>Mostly, Tolle doesn’t mention specifics at all.  Occasionally, he throws in some “science fact” for color.  All of these are mind-bogglingly bogus.</p>
<blockquote><p>What we perceive as physical matter is energy vibrating at a particular range of frequencies. Thoughts consist of the same energy vibrating at a higher frequency than matter, which is why they cannot be seen or touched.  Thoughts have their own range of frequencies, with negative thoughts at the lower end of the scale and positive thoughts at the higher.  (pp. 146-7)</p></blockquote>
<p>A monist might defend Tolle by saying: “How do <em>you</em> know what he says about vibrating thoughts isn't true?  Isn't that just your perspective?”  Of course there is a good answer to this, but it is not one that will persuade monists.</p>
<p>A successful critique of monism needs two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must make the case that monism is not just false, but unworkable in its own terms.  Monism cannot deliver the emotional goods it promises.</li>
<li>It must provide a <em>better alternative</em>, not only to monism but also to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss4')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a> eternalism (traditional religion) and to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss5')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.

(No matter what defects monism shows, people will stick to it if those are the only other choices.)  The better alternative must also incorporate monism’s accurate insights.</li>
</ul>
<p>A page-by-page explanation of what is right and wrong in <i>A New Earth</i> might be helpful.  However, we need the positive alternative first.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The title is misleading. Kramer and Alstad started writing a book about problems in guru-disciple relationships. However, they realized two things: such problems are partly due to common “spiritual” misunderstandings of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a>; and guru-disciple power dynamics are similar to other relationships of authority, with many of the same problems.</p>
<p>So they wound up writing a brilliant analysis of popular spirituality, which comes to many of the same conclusions as <cite>Meaningness</cite>. Their book also has many insights into authority in general. They intended to expand those into a much larger work titled <cite>Control</cite>; but it got out of control and they abandoned it.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, young Americans were naive about gurus. They also deliberately suspended disbelief, because they were desperate for solutions to the <a href="#chap153">disintegration of the Western systematic mode of meaning</a>. By now—probably even by 1991 when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WL0JHE/?tag=meaningness-20">The Guru Papers↗︎︎</a> was published—everyone understood at least the basics of the power issues in the guru-disciple relationship; so maybe the title aspect of the book is no longer as relevant.

Anyway, the book is pretty good on guru problems, but that’s not the reason I got it.</p>
<p>I got it because it contains the best discussion I’ve encountered of contemporary American spiritual <a href="#chap97">monism</a> (“All Is One!”). A large chunk of that is <a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/oneness.enlight.htm">available online↗︎︎</a>, and I recommend it highly. But the book turned out to be relevant and interesting on lots of other topics, and I recommend reading the whole thing.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The remainder of this post is the notes I took while reading the book. I didn’t intend to publish them, but on re-reading, I think they may be useful for some readers. Even without significant editing, they seem to summarize the book quite well.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_thenotes">The notes</h2>
<p>All page numbers are from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EQSEF44/?tag=meaningness-20">1993 paperback edition↗︎︎</a>. There’s a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WL0JHE/?tag=meaningness-20">Kindle edition↗︎︎</a> now, but not when I bought the book. I’ve linked some points in the notes to pages I’ve written on the same topics.</p>
<p>4 “<a href="#chap129">moral certainty</a>… justifies <a href="#chap34">control</a>. A primary function of moral certainty is that it gives [someone] the right to tell people what to do. It is also used as the basis of self-control. This is why … moral certainty… [has] greater emotional appeal than the specific beliefs in which the certainty is grounded. But the beliefs are necessary in order to maintain certainty. Consequently, such beliefs are very resistant to change…”</p>
<p>24–25 “the major extant world religions all promulgate a <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/11/22/renunciation-in-buddhism/">“renunciate” morality↗︎︎</a>…. [and] present <a href="#chap108">self-centeredness…. as the villain</a>… one must surrender one’s will to … God … which usually involves some kind of self-sacrifice”</p>
<p>25 Renunciation used to semi-somewhat work as a basis for morality; it did restrain some bad behavior; but it’s no longer functional</p>
<p>27 “<a href="#chap32">certainty</a> [is] more relaxing and comforting than living with <a href="#chap9">ambiguity</a>.”</p>
<p>41 Renunciation was basically the only way you could do any serious spiritual practice historically, because role expectations were so rigid that you had to “drop out” of society</p>
<p>42 “The appeal of renunciation is that to the extent one can do it, it does bring control over emotional states.

<p>43 Guru scandals are often blamed on the individual guru’s imperfection, but the real problem is with the structure.</p>
<p>45–6 “Often a large component of spiritual seeking is the desire for a place of no conflict, where a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternal ordering principle', 'gloss1')" title="An “eternal ordering principle” (or Cosmic Plan) is any supposed fundamental basis for the universe, providing an ultimate source of value, ethics, and explanation.

<p>49 “Surrender is so potent precisely because it shifts control to an arena that is free, or more free, from one’s inner dramas and the conflicts involved in personal decisions.”</p>
<p>53 Spiritual growth is traditionally presented as “getting rid of the aspects of oneself that are disliked or disapproved of. … That’s why many people need to believe in saints. … giving hope that others, too, can at least become better, if not perfect.”</p>
<p>54 “Surrender to Christ and to a guru have similar dynamics, as they both bring about feelings of passion, a <a href="#chap113">sense of purpose</a>, and the immediate reduction of conflict and tension.”</p>
<p>55 “Surrender to a guru brings instant intimacy with all who share the same values. … many feel alone and disconnected. Acceptance by and identification with the group induce a loosening of personal boundaries. This opening … brings purpose, meaning, and hope.” “… quick, one-dimensional bonding…” “…. being totally cared for …” “feels like being protected by God”</p>
<p>61 “What many people crave nowadays is a sense of connection or <a href="#chap97">union</a> with something they consider sufficiently profound to give their lives meaning. The very act of surrender initially brings this about.”</p>
<p>64 “Having a mini-[mystical]-experience gives hope that grander ones will eventually occur.”</p>

<p>75 Abuse of paradox as a strategy for disarming reason (notably in Zen)</p>
<p>86–87 Attraction of moving up in a spiritual hierarchy; gives some power to people who were generally pretty lame before they joined the cult</p>
<p>91 “sexuality, if left unfettered, risks putting people out of control – and more importantly, out of religion’s control”</p>
<p>92 Celibacy gets people to commit to the guru/hierarchy rather than to lovers</p>
<p>102 Explicitly contra <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/10/23/sutra-vs-tantra/">Sutric Buddhism↗︎︎</a>, their view is that absolute selflessness is impossible [and, they argue later, undesirable]</p>
<p>103 If “control” is taboo, then actual control is exerted covertly via rights, duties, or supposed altruism (‘just doing what is best for others’)</p>
<p>104 Egolessness <em>has</em> to be a central virtue of hierarchic spirituality, because you’d be insane to surrender to someone who was self-interested. So guru has to claim to be selfless.</p>
<p>124 <a href="#chap55">Purity</a> orientation. Wanting to believe that someone (maybe a divine someone if not a guru) has a direct line on truth is closely connected with desire to believe that perfect purity is possible. Perfect purity is <em>not</em> possible, so purity orientation inevitably leads to self-mistrust. Since it’s obvious that perfect purity is not possible in the real world, religions create myth of a separate, pure, spiritual world; and this is the basis of much harm.</p>
<p>128ff Analysis of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018A01L4/?tag=meaningness-20">A Course In Miracles↗︎︎</a>. Hardcore rejection of reality in favor of fantasy world of perfect purity. Total rejection of one’s own ability to reason; all actual experience is rejected as illusory.</p>
<p>130 <cite>A Course In Miracles</cite> is a bizarre mash-up of the nouveau sinless, guiltless Christianity with Hindu monism. This entails numerous, massive logical inconsistencies. </p>
<p>131 What those have in common is a renunciate morality (even if that’s covered in syrup).</p>
<p>132 <cite>A Course In Miracles</cite> as salvation from a divided self</p>
<p>133 Denying reality can make you feel better. But does this lead to a better world? No, because denying destructive, selfish tendencies does not actually make them go away. It doesn’t make death, isolation, and pain go away, either. </p>
<p>133–4 Maintaining denial actually requires constant surveillance of the thing you are pretending isn’t there. This deepens the internal splits that renunciation promises to heal. It requires the construction of a covert inner authoritarian to keep control over the “bad” stuff you reject. This inner tyrant is probably not strong enough to do the job on its own, so you submit to an external authority whose job is to strengthen the internal tyrant.</p>
<p>138 The “<a href="#chap124">you create your own reality</a>” meme requires that you totally create every aspect of it; otherwise, the question “how much control do you actually have” arises, and that’s what the meme is designed to prevent your having to confront.</p>
<p>139 “You create your own reality” can actually be valuable initially in getting you out of <a href="#chap125">victim-think</a>; opening you to new possibilities for action; letting go of blaming others; and in connecting you with a community of positively-oriented people instead of victims, bringing new life and energy and possibility.</p>
<p>141–3 Logical/philosophical problems with subjective idealism.</p>
<p>144 Connection of total responsibility meme with karma theories.</p>
<p>145 Historical origin of total responsibility theory in rejection of psychoanalytic determinism.</p>
<p>145 If everyone creates their own reality, your problems are not my problem; you created them, in order to teach yourself a valuable lesson. How convenient for me not to have to deal with your stuff.</p>
<p>145 “Why is there a lower self at all, or a higher self that needs to give the lower self a lot of painful lessons?”</p>
<p>146–8 More on problems with karma</p>
<p>149 “Control is fluid and ever-changing” [i.e. <a href="#chap9">nebulous</a>]. “to be human involves being both in control and out of control.”</p>
<p>149 The total responsibility stance “generates guilt and feelings of failure when reality obstinately resists the hoped-for omniscience.” </p>
<p>149 Total responsibility stance requires perfect causal isolation of individuals, which is untrue and attempting to live according to it is harmful</p>
<p>165 Moderate revision of traditional religion can’t work; if you remove renunciation, the whole structure collapses. There’s nothing much left</p>
<p>167 Analysis of fundamentalism as a response to the divided self. It’s motivated by fear of internal anarchy; that without external restraint, you couldn’t maintain control over evil parts of yourself, which would run amok. Fundamentalism actually deliberately makes this pattern worse, by reinforcing ideas of internal evil and undercutting self-trust.</p>
<p>167 Why is fundamentalist certainty appealing? Because surrender to it actually does (temporarily) end internal conflicts by tipping the internal power balance. This frees up a lot of energy, and in a social context creates powerful bonds with people who have made the same move.</p>
<p>168 Since the fundamentalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'system', 'gloss2')" title="“Systems,” in this book, are conceptual, methodological, and institutional structures that make claims about meaningness.  These include, for instance, religions, philosophies, political ideologies, and psychological frameworks. A system includes a structure of justification, which explains why you should believe its claims, and typically grounds in an eternal ordering principle. I contrast systems with stances, which are much simpler attitudes toward meaningness.

<p>172–180 Analysis of the new-model nicey-nicey Christianity.</p>
<p>185ff On Satanism. Similar analysis to <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/dark-culture">my black magic series↗︎︎</a> on B4V.</p>
<p>189 “When anything is made sacred (higher), one can always justify sacrificing what is not sacred (lower) to it.”</p>
<p>205 “A truly whole person is one who can integrate the diversities within being human without denying any of them. Just as “good” people attempt to deny the cravings of the animal with them, satanists must deny their empathic caring aspects.”</p>
<p>205 Analysis of communism as a renunciate system (one sacrifices one’s individual desires to the good of The People, i.e. the state). Exceptionally clear failure of renunciate morality, because it didn’t have the excuse that <a href="https://approachingaro.org/no-cosmic-justice">cosmic justice↗︎︎</a> would be enforced in the afterlife.</p>
<p>218 “self-centeredness must be acknowledged as a real part of being human that is ineradicable, necessary, and even valuable.”</p>
<p>218 “justifications for the … abuse of power … often come from a pretense that denies self-interest.” In other words, the tyrant is doing everything for the good of The People.</p>
<p>218–9 “Puritanism involves always trying to get better (<a href="#chap55">purer</a>) – a never-ending task without respite, given that purity is defined in a way that denies the essential worth of being human…”</p>
<p>219 In talking about “internal parts” there’s a danger of over-reification of them</p>
<p>222 Internal splitting into “goodself” and “badself”. The badself has no moral authority (unlike the goodself, which gets external reinforcement), so it has to fight for power (vs. goodself) by various devious, morally illegitimate means.</p>
<p>(The analysis here is similar to Bly’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001VA1PJI/?tag=meaningness-20">Little Book On the Human Shadow↗︎︎</a>.)</p>
<p>223 “But the goodself is not as benign as its espoused values make it seem. Authoritarianism is usually masked by lofty ideals…”</p>
<p>223 “often in relationships one person’s goodself can try to control another’s badself, setting off a reactive battle for control between people.”</p>
<p>223 “The goodself embodies both the dominant and submissive aspects of the authoritarian personality. Since it uses external authorities to bolster its power over the badself and other people, it is conditioned to submit to authorities. The goodself then is dictatorial, judgmental, structured, often a puritanical harsh taskmaster; and above all it is fearful—fearful that without always maintaining control, one’s life would unravel.”</p>
<p>224 “This kind of inner division usually relegates much of self-centeredness and carnality to the badself, thereby distorting and exacerbating them. It also suppresses spontaneity, creativity, and enjoyment for their own sake because these expressions often undermine the goodself’s control mechanisms.”</p>
<p>223 “…suppressions ensure that if what is inhibited ever does break loose, it tends to go wild. This in turn confirms the worst fears of the goodself, verifying its need to keep in control.”</p>
<p>223–4 “A non-fragmented person could treat guilt simply as information that a discrepancy exists between one’s values and behavior… a divided person’s goodself uses guilt as a driving mechanism to remain in control.”</p>
<p>224 “Work and accomplishment, and the rewards and praise they bring, are mechanisms that can keep the goodself in control.”</p>
<p>226 The badself is “needed human expression that does not have an adequate voice–i.e. a historically well-articulated alternate set of values capable of validating needed expressions of carnality and self-centeredness.”</p>
<p>(This is <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/10/24/sutra-tantra-and-the-modern-worldview/">why tantra is so important↗︎︎</a>, I think—it’s perhaps the only religion that says carnality and self-centeredness are OK and necessary and in fact positive goods much of the time.)</p>
<p>226 Because it has no ideological support, “the badself’s route to power is subversion, seduction, and casuistry to sabotage the goodself’s rules.”</p>
<p>226 “People so divided both cage themselves and reactively try to escape their cage… ‘shoulds’… guarantee a life of conflict.”</p>
<p>226 The badself is obviously childish in trying to get around rules, but the goodself is also far from adult.</p>
<p>226 “The badself exerts a powerful allure–that of spontaneity, shameless self-indulgence, cutting loose, throwing caution to the wind, and other taboo enticements, including forbidden expressions of sexuality. Breaking out of the goodself’s boundaries can release a charismatic energy that is seductive to others…”</p>
<p>226–7 The mythic-archetypical outlaw hero offers “an outlet for a repressed culture by igniting a safe collusion with people’s badselves. Thus society put forth a double message: “Rebellion is bad and dangerous,” on one side; and “Rebellion is not only exciting and exhilarating, it is freedom,” on the other…. The double messages society puts out … fragment its members”</p>
<p>227 “Groups easily form around eliciting and reinforcing either the good or badself; these alliances serves as a mechanism to bolster the control of that side.”</p>
<p>227 The goodself is often destructive, using “purity” as a justification. Lynch mobs, law-and-order vigilantes, theocratic oppression.</p>
<p>228 The goodself and badself both need each other to justify their existence, so they unconsciously collude to create conflict. Becoming aware of this is the way to defuse the hostility and eventually heal the split.</p>
<p>229ff Analysis of addiction as a way the badself escapes the goodself.</p>
<p>252 “being fragmented makes it nigh impossible to tell the difference between what one really wants and “shoulds,” which are often mistaken for true desires. Conflict, resistance, procrastination, and guilt can be indications of a divided self that acts differently than it thinks it ought.”</p>
<p>253 “Becoming interested in seeing the nature of the game… curiosity… a respect that acknowledges the importance of each [self] can be the beginning of a more healthy inner dialogue.”</p>
<p>262ff Analysis of idealized theories of love: as selfless, unconditional, immeasurable, etc. These are impossible to live up to because they deny vital, necessary, positive functions of the psyche. Attempting to live up to them messes up relationships in several predictable ways.</p>
<p>263–4 Unconditional love is a real experience, but it’s inherently impermanent. It occurs only in particular contexts. In the moment, the context seems irrelevant, but over time the context is crucial. Explicitly, this is similar to mystical experience, which seems timeless and unconditioned in the moment, but actually cannot be protracted and depends on all sorts of conditions. See also p. 287 on this.</p>
<p>265 Ideologies of love that tie it to self-sacrifice. “This fosters masochism and martyrdom”</p>
<p>270 “Love has an energy that breaks open the boundaries of the self, and in doing so is a connector that brings joy and meaning beyond self-enhancement.” From this one can mistakenly conclude that selflessness by itself can produce love.</p>
<p>273 Ideals of pure love are entirely individualistic—you supposedly can love someone purely, regardless of what they do, or any other aspects of context. Some may conclude that “the worse a relationship is, the more one can prove one’s purity and love through sacrifice.”</p>
<p>274 The idea that love ought to be entirely separate from power and control is wrong. That would make love “pure”; and this is the same conceptual move that separates “the spiritual” from “the mundane.” (Or “<a href="#chap112">mission and materialism</a>,” in my terms.) However, “Attempting to purify love by eliminating power does not do so, but instead makes the way power is expressed less conscious and more covertly manipulative.”</p>
<p>274 Dominance and submission dynamics in love and in authoritarian cults.</p>
<p>275 “what feels like unconditional love is really a function of a context that is conditional on submission.”</p>
<p>279 It’s normal for adolescents to try to escape all forms of control, but insisting on this in adulthood is to remain a perpetual adolescent. “intimacy in adult relationships contains both the exercise of power and the desire at least sometimes to control the other.”</p>
<p>279 Traditional roles minimize conflict by setting rules for who controls whom in what ways. As these roles break down in contemporary society, power struggles are inevitable. (p. 283: “there are no formulas”) More on this on p. 299 too.</p>
<p>280 “To be open to a person, the world, whatever, is to be affected by it, which means one’s feelings are somewhat out of one’s control.”</p>
<p>281 You can’t entirely control your emotions. The more open you are to others, the less control you have.</p>
<p>284 Positive values of control in an intimate relationship. Willingness to do what the other wants can take you into unknown territory and this can be transformative. “Transformation comes from the interplay of control and surrender.”</p>
<p>286–7 Dominance and submission; sadomasochism; addiction to abusive relationships.</p>
<p>288–9 In non-traditional relationships, you have to take an engineering attitude [my terminology] to “is this working”. This involves “measuring” [their terminology] which is taboo in idealized theories of love.</p>
<p>290 “Once self-centeredness is acknowledged as a reality, the issue becomes how to deal with it intelligently.” More on relationship engineering.</p>
<p>292 “Forgiveness” as an aspect of idealized love. Depending on what is meant by this, it’s often stupid and self-destructive. </p>
<p>292–3 Defense mechanisms are valuable; that’s why we have them. We need boundaries. You have to decide intelligently how open to be at any given time. “You should always be maximally open” is idiotic.</p>
<p>294 “Understanding and empathy are more valuable in softening boundaries than ideals”</p>
<p>294 “becoming comfortable with ambiguity, which allows more freedom to change. The difficulty is that living with such ambiguity involves being aware of one’s changing boundaries and their effects. In contrast, set boundaries need less attention…”</p>
<p>295ff Religious justifications for unconditional love.</p>
<p>301ff Chapter on “Oneness, Enlightenment, and the Mystical Experience”</p>
<p>303 “Traditions that made an ideology out of the concept of Oneness created a morality that denigrated or made unreal the individual self with its individual interests. Any worldview that denies either the reality or importance of the individuated self ends up defining virtue as selflessness, which is achieved through self-sacrifice. When renouncing self-interest is the spiritual path, we define the morality as renunciate. Renunciate moralities have neither eliminated nor diminished self-interest, but have often made its expression more hidden and thus corruptible.”</p>
<p>304–5 Nice summary of the Oneness view.</p>
<p>306 Hidden dualism within Oneness view: Oneness is better than, and separate from, multiplicity.</p>
<p>306 “If unity is valued more than diversity, the inevitable result is the attempt to get to unity by negating or in some fashion lessening the value and importance of separation.”</p>
<p>306–7 Spirituality seen as re-identifying with Oneness instead of your self. “This results in making people’s concerns with their own individual lives the source of all problems. In short, this is the East’s way of making self-centeredness the villain.”</p>
<p>309 “Creating a special category called the “enlightened state” is itself a manifestation of an accumulation mentality, becoming the ultimate goal to achieve through accumulating merit and partially enlightening experiences.”</p>
<p>309 “The experience of unity feels timeless, but the concept of enlightenment turns a timeless moment into an “all the time” fixed identity that continues over time.”</p>
<p>310 “a spiritual path from the lower to the higher”</p>
<p>310 “Enlightenment is the way hierarchy is brought in by viewing a few individuals as special channels for, and greater manifestations of, this underlying unity.”</p>
<p>313 “Denying change in the spiritual realm is basically a fundamentalist stance used to protect the sacred and tradition. But perceiving deeply is a process that is necessarily historically embedded, for each epoch has its particular illusions that must be pierced.”</p>
<p>314 Boundaries are necessary, even if they are semi-permeable. Trying to make sense of life while denying this just causes confusion.</p>
<p>318 Sacralizing Oneness makes it inevitable that sacrificing one’s self (individuality) to it will be demanded.</p>
<p>319 “The danger in holistic thinking lies in not giving separation an equal place”</p>
<p>319–321 Refuting “the total interconnectedness of everything.” Most things don’t affect most other things.</p>
<p>320 “Often favoring such holistic horizontal thinking has within it an anti-hierarchical political agenda” (which they don’t agree with; they think hierarchies are necessary and useful).</p>
<p>321 “Freedom needs some degree of separation to operate.” (So you don’t have to be causally affected by everything.)</p>
<p>322 Against Buddhist “interconnectedness” bullshit. This metaphysics is always timeless and nonspecific. What’s connected with what?</p>
<p>324 “Once unity or interconnectedness is made sacred, a category is created that is not sacred—individuals and their individual concerns.” This as a basis for renunciate moralities.</p>
<p>325 “renunciate religions are all based on accruing and stockpiling spiritual merit and are accumulative to the core.” </p>
<p>345 Monotheism supplanted polytheism partly because it had a more coherent, reliable ethical system. Tribal, poly gods do whatever they want and favor their own families; there are no principles there. Monotheistic universalist absolutism does create a basis for cross-tribal trust relationships that were important in building large diverse societies.</p>
<p>348–54 Another chapter on Oneness, this time as contrasted with monotheism. General analysis is that it is more abstract, and more abstract systems are more powerful. (I don’t think this is quite right.)</p>
<p>350 “As the most abstract of all religious concepts, Oneness is therefore the most impervious to direct challenge.”</p>
<p>351 “Hindu Oneness accentuates permanence and so acted as a foundation for perpetuating the caste system.”</p>
<p>350–1 Covert dualism in Oneness view: between sameness and difference.</p>
<p>351 Abstracting the sacred from nature allowed religions to denigrate the latter.</p>
<p>352 Hierarchies within the abstract system mirror and justify social hierarchies of priestly (and sometimes secular) power.</p>
<p>359 Devaluing thought leads to uncritically naive thinking, and to unconsciousness of all these dynamics</p>
<p>361 Earliest sacrificial systems sacrificed material objects (food e.g.) Then renunciate moralities came up with long lists of more abstract rules to follow. The final development is valorizing self-sacrifice <em>as such</em>, as a general way of being. This is, of course, extremely helpful to rulers.</p>
<p>364 Cooperation and competition are not opposed to each other; most social activities involve both, woven together in different ways.</p>
<p>365 “If one values cooperation over competition, then it is very easy to remain unconscious of the competitive element.” Cooperation isn’t selfless; it’s usually aimed at personal benefit.</p>
<p>366 “Having one’s own spiritual advancement as the focus of one’s life is totally self-absorbed”</p>

<p class="intro_para">It’s the perfect postmodern nightmare.  You wake up to discover that you are the anti-hero character in a novel.  Worse, it is a famously badly written novel.  It is, in fact, an endlessly long philosophical diatribe <em>pretending</em> to be a novel.  And it uses all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_literature#Common_themes_and_techniques">tiresome technical tricks↗︎︎</a> of postmodern fiction.  It is convolutedly self-referential; a novel about a novel that is an endlessly long philosophical diatribe pretending to be a novel about a novel about…</p>

It’s all that.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_gkegxa6" id="extra29_footnoteref1_gkegxa6" title="It’s also brilliant, inspiring, funny, and (in the end) touching.  Two thumbs up.">1</a></p>
<p>And it seems to be about me.  I mean, me <em>personally</em>.</p>
<p>The book diagnoses the psychology of a generation.  Many readers have said it is about them, in the sense that they are of that generation, and they discovered ruefully that <i>Boomeritis</i> painted an accurate portrait.</p>
<p>But the central character in the book is a student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory who discovers <a href="http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp">Continental philosophy↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_theory">social theory↗︎︎</a>, realizes that AI is on a fundamentally wrong track, and sets about reforming the field to incorporate those other viewpoints.</p>
<p>That describes precisely two people in the real world: me, and my sometime-collaborator <a href="http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/">Phil Agre↗︎︎</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know about “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideas_of_reference">delusions of reference↗︎︎</a>”?

It’s a typical symptom of schiozophrenic psychosis.</p>
<p>Is <i>Boomeritis</i> actually about me?  Or is my suspicion that I am the model for its central character a sign of psychosis?  A question probably only of interest to me—but I’ll return to it at the end of this page.</p>
<p>Mostly, instead, I’ll explain ways in which the novel, and my work at the MIT AI Lab, are relevant to <i>Meaningness</i>.  All three concern the problem of the relationship of self and other.

<p>You can figure this part out, right?  These views hate each other; each thinks the other is the fast road to hell.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_yellow" style="color:#dd0">Yellow</h3>
<p>The thing is, orange and green are <i>both right</i>.</p>
<p>They are also both wrong.  Their virulent criticisms of each other are both correct.  But their own central values are also both correct.  We need the <i>right</i> parts of both, without the wrong parts.</p>
<p>That combination, supposedly, is yellow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big picture, open systems, networks, global flows</li>
<li>Flexible, simultaneous consideration of multiple perspectives</li>
<li>Tolerance for chaos, change, and uncertainty</li>
<li>Integration of ranking (hierarchy) and linking (community)</li>

<li>Capacity to act in both orange and green modes as appropriate</li>

<a id="extra29_boomeritis" name="boomeritis"><h2>Boomeritis</h2></a>
<p>The Baby Boom generation—people born roughly 1946 through 1960—was the first to include many with a green worldview.  That is a great accomplishment; green is a partly-right response to errors in orange.</p>
<p>“Boomeritis” is the syndrome of getting stuck at green, fighting fruitlessly against orange, and failing to move on to yellow.  When Boomeritis looks at yellow, it sees orange—because yellow incorporates aspects of orange that green rejects.</p>
<p>The cause of Boomeritis is narcissism.  It is based on “nobody can tell me what to do.”  Hierarchy is unacceptable.  I take direction from no one.  Objective facts limit my fantasies, so science must be a patriarchal, oppressive myth.  Reasoning often points out that I am wrong, so I ditch rationality for “intuition,” which somehow always tells me what I want to hear.  In any competition, I might lose, so everyone must be awarded gold stars, because everyone is equal.  Nothing, and no one, can be better or worse than anything or anyone else.  That <em>wouldn’t be nice</em>—because then I might not be the most <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'specialness', 'gloss4')" title="Someone is thought to be special if they are given a particular distinct value by the (imaginary) Cosmic Plan.

<p>I discovered <i>Boomeritis</i> when researching the role of the Baby Boomers in Western Buddhism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_0jx6bkt" id="extra29_footnoteref3_0jx6bkt" title="I wrote about that on this page on Approaching Aro.">3</a>  Wilber discussed that in his essay “<a href="http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/boomeritis/sidebar_h/index.cfm/">Boomeritis Buddhism↗︎︎</a>”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The result is a Buddhism that claims to be egalitarian, pluralistic, non-marginalizing, anti-stage, and especially anti-hierarchy. And, alas, all of the moves of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics#Pathologies">mean green meme↗︎︎</a> then swing into play: it claims to be egalitarian, but it actually condemns all those views that disagree with it (but how could it, if all views are truly equal?)</p>
<p>It rejects the teacher-student model, since we are all equal spiritual friends on the same path together (but why are people paying these teachers money if we’re all equals here?)</p>
<p>It rejects hierarchy in any fashion (but why does it rank its view as better than all the alternatives?) It claims that pluralism is the true voice of the Mystery of the Divine (but why does it reject all of the numerous other voices that disagree with it?)</p>
<p>And sometimes it goes so far that it denies the importance of <em>enlightenment</em> altogether, because all spiritual experiences are to be viewed equally without any judging or ranking, and saying that there is a thing called ‘enlightenment’ implies that those who are not enlightened are somehow inferior, and that’s not a nice thing to say, so we won’t say it. The very <i>raison d’etre</i> of Buddhism—namely, release from suffering in the Great Liberation of the awakened mind, which allows the compassionate salvation of all sentient beings—is tossed out the window because it is politically incorrect… Boomeritis Buddhism is probably the greatest internal threat to Dharma in the West.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with this strongly,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_bh91tkl" id="extra29_footnoteref4_bh91tkl" title="Relatedly, my Buddhist teachers (Boomers themselves) have been pointing out these problems for 20+ years.

<h2>After postmodernism</h2>
<p>“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism">Postmodernism↗︎︎</a>” is the academic version of the green worldview.  <i>Boomeritis</i> was originally written as an academic/philosophical criticism of postmodernism.  Wilber says it was pretty unreadable, when he’d finished; so at the last minute he turned it into a novel instead.</p>
<p>Postmodernism, although obscure and obtuse, is important because it is the dominant orthodoxy in academia, and university indoctrination is one of the main ways Boomeritis is transmitted to younger generations.</p>
<p>It is also important because, beneath its billowing briny blather, postmodernism’s green critique of orange is <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The problem is that, on its own, green leads inexorably to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss5')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>.  That is not obvious; <i>Boomeritis</i> spends most of its 456 pages explaining it.  Here’s a super-condensed version:</p>
<ul>
<li>If meaning is purely subjective, and you embrace all perspectives as equally valid, then at points of disagreement meaning completely disintegrates.</li>
<li>If ethics is merely cultural convention, there <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ethical nihilism', 'gloss6')" title="Ethical nihilism is the stance that ethics are a meaningless human invention and have no real claim on us. [Click for details.]">is no way to condemn</a> evils such as the “honor killing” of women who have been raped.</li>
<li>If <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ordinariness', 'gloss7')" title="Ordinariness is the  confused stance that no one is better than anyone else, and that one’s value derives from herd membership. [Click for details.]">everyone is automatically equal</a>, there is no call to be any better than you are.  There is no possibility of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nobility', 'gloss8')" title="Nobility is the stance that resolves specialness and ordinariness.  Nobility consists in using whatever capacities one has on behalf of others. [Click for details.]">nobility</a>.</li>
<li>If everyone is <em>supposed</em> to be equal, all differences must be due to <em>evil oppressors</em>.  Anyone who is not an oppressor is an all-good <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'victim-think', 'gloss9')" title="The stance that “it's not my fault and I am too weak to deal with it.” [Click for details.]">victim</a>.  Since <em>we</em> are victims, the oppressors must be <em>them</em>.  We ought to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss10" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'romantic rebellion', 'gloss10')" title="The stance of defying authority, in an unrealistic way, to make an artistic statement. [Click for details.]">rebel</a> against the oppressors (and probably kill them all).  But this is automatically doomed to failure, because (by definition) the oppressors have all the power (or else we might not be victims, just lazy).  So we’d better not actually try to improve anything; instead, we’ll demonstrate sincerity with the vehemence of our denunciations.</li>
</ul>
<p>After thirty years of chewing on such contradictions, it’s widely understood that postmodernism is unworkable.  There is no way forward within the green worldview.</p>
<p>So now what?</p>
<p>What comes after postmodernism?</p>
<p>Shockingly few people seem to be working on that question.  It’s hard, because green’s logic, its critique of orange, seems unassailable; yet it leads to a bleak dead end.</p>
<p>Somehow we need to integrate what is right in both the orange and green worldviews to produce some sort of “yellow.”  This web site—<i>Meaningness</i>—could be seen as one attempt at that.</p>
<p><i>Boomeritis</i> does a fine job of exposing the contradictions in green, and has decent sketch of what yellow might look like.  But then…</p>
<h2>Whoa!  Ken, WTF?</h2>
<p>Although I admire <i>Boomeritis</i>, I oppose much of Wilber’s other work.  Mainly he advocates <a href="#chap21">monist eternalism</a>, which I think is disastrously wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, Wilber (together with <a href="#extra3">Eckhart Tolle</a>) seems to be the main source for a new form of <a href="#extra2">pop spirituality</a>.  This movement repackages the <a href="#extra1">German Idealist philosophy</a> Wilber loves, in a glossy new “<a href="#extra11">spiritual but not religious</a>” form that particularly appeals to younger generations.</p>
<p>The key ideas here are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss11" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss11')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a> and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eternalism: there is a God (but sometimes we’ll call it something else, like “The Absolute,” to deflect the arguments for atheism).</li>
<li>Monism: you, God, and The Entire Universe are All One.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_jtj7dwu" id="extra29_footnoteref5_jtj7dwu" title="Monists love capital letters.  Is that because they think capitals look impressive, or is it the result of bad translations from German?">5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just at the end of <i>Boomeritis</i>, something really bad happens.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_8h0mxn4" id="extra29_footnoteref6_8h0mxn4" title="Philosophically bad. It works quite well as fiction.">6</a> <i>[Spoiler warning:]</i>  The anti-hero (who may be me) becomes God.</p>
<p>Wilber proposes that becoming God is what comes after yellow—and the main reason to get to yellow is to go on to become God.</p>
<p>This quest to become God is a central theme in his other work, so I shouldn’t be surprised; but I <em>am</em> appalled.</p>
<p>It’s not just that I think it’s wrong.  It’s that his own critique of the green worldview—its monism and its narcissism—seems to apply directly.</p>
<p>He recognizes the contradiction, and dismisses it.  He makes the usual monist-eternalist move, which goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we say ‘God,’ we don’t mean God, we mean The Absolute, which is ineffable, and is the same as The Entire Universe.  You have to admit that the universe exists.  And when we say ‘you,’ we don’t mean your ordinary ego, we mean your <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss13" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'true self', 'gloss13')" title='The “deep" or “true” or “authentic” self is an imaginary, inaccessible superior identity, which has a magical connection with the Cosmic Plan.  “Depth psychology” is particularly big on the true self, but this confused idea has become wide-spread. [Click for details.]'>true self</a>, which is divine and pure, so there’s no narcissism involved.  See?  No problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is hokum.  There is no Absolute, you are not the entire universe, and there is no “true self.”  This stuff is simple wish-fulfillment; a fantasy of personal omnipotence and immortality.  (As I will explain in plodding detail <a href="#chap97">in the book</a>.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI">interesting part↗︎︎</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI research↗︎︎</a> is the attempt to <em>create minds, people, selves</em>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_q7xy48c" id="extra29_footnoteref7_q7xy48c" title="“Artificial intelligence” is also used to mean “writing programs to do things that are hard, like playing chess.”  This is interesting if you are an engineer, but has no broader implications.">7</a>  Besides the fun of playing Dr. Frankenstein, AI calls orange’s bluff.</p>
<p>Orange says that rationality is what is essential to being human.  If that’s right, we ought be able to program rationality into a computer, and thereby create something that is also essentially human—an intelligent self—although it would not be of our species.</p>
<p>This project seemed to be going very well up until about 1980, when progress ground to a halt.  Perhaps it was a temporary lull?  Ironically, by 1985, hype about AI in the press reached its all-time peak.  Human-level intelligence was supposed to be just around the corner.  Huge amounts of money poured into the field.  For those of us on the inside, the contrast between image and reality was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">getting embarrassing↗︎︎</a>.  What had gone wrong?</p>
<p>An annoying philosopher named Hubert Dreyfus had been arguing for years that AI was impossible.  He wrote a book about this called <cite>What Computers Can’t Do</cite>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_2zpo7gb" id="extra29_footnoteref8_2zpo7gb" title="Now out of print, but his revised edition, What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason, is still available.">8</a>  We had all read it, and it was silly.  He claimed that a dead German philosopher named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger">Martin Heidegger↗︎︎</a> proved that AI couldn’t work.  Heidegger is famous as being the most obscure, voluminous, and anti-intellectual philosopher of all time.</p>
<p>I found a more sensible diagnosis.  Rationality requires reasoning about the effects of actions.  This turned out to be surprisingly difficult, and came to be called the “<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/">frame problem↗︎︎</a>”.  In 1985, I proved a series of mathematical theorems that showed that the frame problem was probably <em>inherently unsolvable</em>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_ngxew3n" id="extra29_footnoteref9_ngxew3n" title="The canonical citation for this would be “Planning for conjunctive goals,” Artificial Intelligence, Volume 32, Issue 3, July 1987, Pages 333-377.  But that costs money, and it’s a shortened version of MIT AI Technical Report 802, which you could download for free if you want to geek out.  The important bit is the intractability theorem (page 23, proof pp. 45-46).  The undecidability theorems are also cute, but less philosophically relevant.">9</a></p>
<p>This was a jarring result.  Rational action requires a solution to the frame problem; but rationality (a mathematical proof) appeared to show that no solution was possible.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_0l79x5d" id="extra29_footnoteref10_0l79x5d" title="Technically, what I proved was the NP-completeness of the frame problem.  Roughly, this means that there is no solution that is both practical and general.  There are general solutions that are “exponential time” (meaning inherently impractical), and non-general solutions that can solve particular classes of problems.  Neither of these is philosophically interesting, in my opinion.">10</a></p>
<p>Orange had turned against itself, and cut off the tree-limb it was standing on.  Still, as we hurtled to the ground, we figured that we’d somehow find a way out.  There <em>had</em> to be a solution, because of course we <em>do</em> all act rationally.</p>
<p>At this point, Phil Agre came back from a gig in California with a shocking announcement:</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;font-size:2em;color:black"><em>Dreyfus was right.</em></p>
<p>What??  Had Phil gone over to the Dark Side?</p>
<p>But with the announcement, he brought the secret key: a pre-publication draft of Dreyfus’ next book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262540568/?tag=meaningness-20">Being-in-the-World↗︎︎</a>, which for the first time made Heidegger’s magnum opus, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061575593/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a>, comprehensible.</p>
<p><cite>Being and Time</cite> demolishes the whole orange framework.  Human <i>being</i> is not a matter of calculation. People are not isolated individuals, living in a world of dead material objects, strategizing to manipulate them to achieve utilitarian goals.  We are always already embedded in a web of connections with living nature and with other people.  Our actions are called forth spontaneously by the situation we find ourselves in—not rationally planned in advance.</p>
<p>If you have a green worldview, you’re thinking “duh, everyone knows all that—we don’t need a dead German philosopher to tell us.”  But it is only because of Heidegger that you can be green.  More than anyone else, he invented that worldview.</p>
<p><i>Being-in-the-World</i> showed us <em>why</em> the frame problem was insoluble.  But it also provided an alternative understanding of activity.  Most of the time, you simply <em>see</em> what to do.  Action is driven by perception, not plans.</p>
<p id="extra29_seeing">Now, <em>seeing</em> is something us AI guys knew something about.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer vision research↗︎︎</a> had been about identifying manufactured objects in a scene.

<p>Yes, it could.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_1b6qy1d" id="extra29_footnoteref11_1b6qy1d" title="See my “Intermediate Vision: Architecture, Implementation, and Use”, Cognitive Science 16(4) (1992), pp. 491-537.">11</a>  In a feverish few months, Agre and I developed a completely new, non-orange approach to AI.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_r8rn2aw" id="extra29_footnoteref12_r8rn2aw" title="The best summary of this is in Phil’s Computation and Human Experience (Cambridge University Press, 1997).  The full text of his introduction is online.

Interestingly, two other groups came to similar conclusions independently, just about the same time Agre and I did, although based on purely technical rather than philosophical considerations.  These were Rod Brooks and the team of Leslie Kaelbling and Stanley Rosenschein.">13</a></p>
<p>In 1987, we wrote a computer program called Pengi that illustrated some of what we had learned from Dreyfus, Heidegger, and the Continental philosophical tradition.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_gacirg6" id="extra29_footnoteref14_gacirg6" title="“Pengi: An Implementation of a Theory of Activity,” Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1987, pp. 268-272.

It did not have to mentally represent and reason about its circumstances, because it was embedded in them, causally coupled with them in a purposive dance.  Its skill came from spontaneous improvisation, not strategic planning.  Its apparently intelligent activity derived from interactive dynamics that—continually involving both its self and others—were neither subjective nor objective.</p>
<p>Pengi was a triumph: it could do things that the old paradigm clearly couldn’t, and (although quite crude) seemed to point to a wide-open new paradigm for further research.  AI was unstuck again!  And, in fact, Pengi was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cites=1539961832122933456&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=SxaOTeeFH4SssAOqpqWDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=science_links&amp;ct=sl-citedby&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCgQzgIwAg">highly influential↗︎︎</a> for a few years.</p>

<p>Although arguably non-orange, Pengi was hardly green.  Particularly, it was in no sense social.  The next program I wrote, Sonja, illustrated certain aspects of what it might mean for an AI to be socially embedded.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_4m9zzj6" id="extra29_footnoteref15_4m9zzj6" title="Described in Vision, Instruction, and Action.

This work is arguably “yellow,” in offering orange-language explanations for green facts of existence.</p>
<p>There was another problem.  Pengi’s job was to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pengo_%28video_game%29">a particular video game↗︎︎</a>.  Its ability to do that had to be meticulously programmed in by hand.  We found that programming more complicated abilities was difficult (although there seemed to be no obstacle in principle).  Also, although perhaps ant brains come wired up by evolution to do everything they ever can, people are flexible and adaptable.  We pick up new capabilities in new circumstances.</p>
<p>The way forward seemed to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning↗︎︎</a>, an existing technical field.  Working with Leslie Kaelbling, I tried to find ways an AI could develop skills with experience.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_zh8bgl1" id="extra29_footnoteref16_zh8bgl1" title="“Input generalization in delayed reinforcement learning: An algorithm and performance comparisons,” Proceedings of the 12th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1991.">16</a>  The more I thought about this, though, the harder it seemed.  “Machine learning” is a fancy word for “statistics,” and statistics take an awful lot of data to reach any conclusions.  People frequently learn all they need from a single event, because we understand what is going on.</p>
<p>In 1992, I concluded that, although AI is probably possible in principle, <em>no one has any clue where to start</em>.  So I lost interest and went off to do other things.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_9ytl3hb" id="extra29_footnoteref17_9ytl3hb" title="Recently, Dreyfus published an analysis of why Phil and I failed (Artificial Intelligence 171(18), 2007).">17</a></p>
<p>In <i>Boomeritis</i>, the anti-hero—who may be me—says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know, the computer part sounds far out, but that’s only because you don’t know what’s actually happening in AI.  I’m telling you, it’s moving faster than you can imagine.  (p. 306)</p></blockquote>
<p>The reality, though, is that AI is moving slower than you can imagine.  There’s been no noticeable progress in the past twenty years.  And a few pages later “I” explain why:</p>

<p>In <i>Boomeritis</i>, the AI plot is a paper-thin “<a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/metablog/stories-within-stories">frame story↗︎︎</a>” around the long philosophy lecture.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_wc7fogj" id="extra29_footnoteref18_wc7fogj" title="Wilber says he wrote it in ten days, after the lecture was finished.">18</a> There’s just enough detail to make me think Ken Wilber did visit the MIT AI Lab, though.</p>
<p>I suspect that he read a draft of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/037572527X//?tag=meaningness-20">Flesh and Machines: How Robots Will Change Us↗︎︎</a>, by Rodney Brooks, which came out the same year as <cite>Boomeritis</cite>.  Rod was head dude at the AI Lab then—and was my PhD supervisor.  Here’s <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/books%20&amp;%20movies.html">an excerpt from his book:↗︎︎</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The body, this mass of biomolecules, is a machine that acts according to a set of specifiable rules... We are machines, as are our spouses, our children, and our dogs... I believe myself and my children all to be mere machines. But this is not how I treat them. I treat them in a very special way, and I interact with them on an entirely different level. They have my unconditional love, the furthest one might be able to get from rational analysis. Like a religious scientist, I maintain two sets of inconsistent beliefs and act on each of them in different circumstances. It is this transcendence between belief systems that I think will be what enables mankind to ultimately accept robots as emotional machines, and thereafter start to empathize with them and attribute free will, respect, and ultimately rights to them... When our robots improve enough, beyond their current limitations, and when we credit humans, then too we will break our mental barrier, our need, our desire, to retain tribal specialness, differentiating ourselves from them.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have read <i>Boomeritis</i>, you will find this sounds familiar.</p>
<p>So, was I the model for the book’s anti-hero?  My guess is that Wilber had a conversation with Rod, who asked him what he did.  Wilber mentioned German philosophy, and Rod said “hmm, that sounds like the stuff David Chapman used to go on about.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“David Chapman.  He was a student here a while back.  After doing some nice mathematical work, he and another guy, Phil Agre, suddenly started ranting about existential phenomenology and hermeneutics and ethnomethodology.  No one could understand a word of it.  We figured they were taking too much LSD.</p>
<p>“But then they started writing programs, and the story gradually came into focus.  Intelligence <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">depends on the body↗︎︎</a>; AI systems have to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">situated in an interpretable social world↗︎︎</a>; understanding is not dependent on rules and representations; skillful action doesn’t usually come from planning.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, that sounds like the green meme in Spiral Dynamics!”</p>
<p>“Well, whatever.  Spare me the gobbledegook.  Anyway, I was thinking along pretty similar lines at the same time, because I was building robots, and it turns out that if you want to make a robot that actually works, the whole abstract/cognitive/logical paradigm is useless.  It’s a matter of connecting perception with action.  I never got into all that German stuff, though.”</p>
<p>“So what happened to Chapman?  It sounds like I should talk to him.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/phd%20students.html">I haven’t a clue.↗︎︎</a>  He disappeared a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“What a bizarre story!  You know, I’ve just finished writing a long boring book critiquing postmodernism, but suddenly I’m thinking it might work better as a novel…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that’s <em>not</em> what happened, the coincidental similarity of Wilber’s anti-hero to me (and/or Agre) would be almost as odd.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, I am a <em>historical inevitability</em>.  If I had not existed, it would have been necessary to invent me—and Wilber did.</p>
<p>Of course, I could just ask him.  But <a href="https://approachingaro.org/certainty">uncertainty is more fun↗︎︎</a>.  “Yes” or “no” would remove the mystery, and the surreal groundlessness of not knowing whether I am a character in a novel.</p>
<p>Besides, it allows for retaliation…</p>

<li>(1a) Nothing really means anything.</li>
<li>(2a) Human beings appear to be animals with bodies of flesh and blood, but really we are beings of pure potential, with bodies of light.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is useful to reword “really” claims with “in some sense” instead:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1b) In some sense, nothing means anything.</li>
<li>(2b) Human beings appear to be animals with bodies of flesh and blood, but in some sense we are beings of pure potential, with bodies of light.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are honest statements. I think <i>in some sense</i> they may both true—whereas 1a and 2a are certainly false, but hard to argue with.</p>
<p>An “in some sense” statement invites questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>(1c) In <i>what</i> sense does nothing mean anything?  How can I check that for myself?  Why do things seem meaningful if (in some sense) they aren’t?  Is the kind of meaninglessness you describe one I should care about?</li>
<li>(2c) In what sense do we have bodies of light?  Why can’t we see these other bodies, and what is unreal about the flesh-and-blood ones?  What good is a body I can’t see?  How am I supposed to use this alternate body?</li>
</ol>
<p>We shouldn’t necessarily insist on answers to such questions—there might be legitimate reasons they are unanswerable, despite the truth or usefulness of 1b and 2b.  But we should at least be able to ask them.</p>
<p>The power of “really” is to stop you from asking.  If you can’t see that everything is meaningless, it means that you are just not smart enough to understand.  If you don’t know that you have a body of light, it means that you are just not spiritual enough to see it.  “Really” means “shut up, kid—I’ve got all the answers.  I have access to the <i>real world</i> and you don’t.”  </p>
<p>Statement 1a claims that <i>in the real world</i> (that you are too stupid to understand) everything is meaningless.  Your belief in meaning is a delusion.  2a claims that <i>in the real world</i> (that you are too crassly materialistic to enjoy) people have bodies of light.  The mundane flesh-and-blood world is illusory.</p>
<p>These are huge, implausible metaphysical claims.  Defending them would be difficult at best.  “Really” is a way of intimidating you into accepting them without explanation.</p>
<p>When someone hands you a “really” claim, try making it into an “in some sense” claim, and then ask the obvious questions.</p>
<p>When you find yourself making “really” claims (which we all do, sometimes), try and backtrack and restate them as “in some sense” claims.  And then try to say which sense, and why you think so.</p>

<p class="intro_para"><dfn>Pop Bayesianism</dfn> is an odd spiritual movement I've been puzzling over recently. In the new video above, Julia Galef explains how it has changed the way she thinks. I found her explanation startling.</p>
<p>This book—<cite>Meaningness</cite>—has much in common with the Bayesian movement. Both aim to improve the way regular people think. We want to provide tools for noticing and escaping common, mistaken, emotionally-laden patterns of thought, which often cause big trouble.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think Bayesianism is also mistaken, and maybe harmful; yet many smart, well-meaning people get caught up in it. As a social phenomenon, it is fascinating, yet baffling.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_teachingprobability">Teaching probability</h2>
<p>On a charitable interpretation of pop Bayesianism, its message is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone needs to understand basic probability theory!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a sentiment I agree with violently. I think most people <em>could</em> understand probability, and it should be taught in high school. It’s not really difficult, and it’s incredibly valuable. For instance, many public policy issues can’t properly be understood without probability theory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if this is the pop Bayesians’ agenda, they aren’t going at it right. They preach almost exclusively a formula called Bayes’ Rule. (The start of Julia Galef’s video features it in neon.) That is <em>not</em> a good way to teach probability.</p>
<div class="leftimg">
<img alt="Bayes' formula" height="48" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bayes_rule_216x48.jpg" title="Bayes' formula" width="216"/>
</div>
<p>Bayes’ Rule is hard to understand on its own. If you try to teach people just that, they are not going to get it. Also, the formula is almost never useful in everyday life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, once you understand the basic principles of probability, Bayes’ Rule is obvious, and not particularly important. Many similar calculations become obvious once you get the fundamental ideas clearly.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_tqb8tco" id="extra29_footnoteref1_tqb8tco" title="I suspect it is metaphysics that stops Bayesians from teaching probability in an understandable way. Gian-Carlo Rota, who taught probability at MIT when I was there, would frequently exclaim “It’s all just balls into boxes!” You can solve any probability problem easily if you look at it that way. This presentation is “frequentist,” though, which Bayesians reject on metaphysical grounds. I would suggest that, if you are committed to Bayesian metaphysics, it would still be best to teach “balls into boxes” first, because it makes the calculations easy. Then you can explain that frequentism is the root of all evil, and Bayesian metaphysics is the One True Way to salvation.">1</a> It’s all just arithmetic.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_bayesruleasreligiousicon">Bayes’ Rule as religious icon</h2>
<p>In pop Bayesianism, the Rule is evidently <em>not</em> arithmetic; it is the sacred symbol of Rationality.</p>
<p>In the video, Galef admits this almost immediately (0:35). Occasions in which you can actually apply the formula are rare. Instead, it’s a sort of holy metaphor, or religious talisman. You bow down to it to show your respect for Rationality and membership in the Bayesian religion.</p>
<p>The rest of the video goes on to say that Bayesianism boils down to “don’t be so sure of your beliefs; be less sure when you see contradictory evidence.” </p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> is just common sense. Why does anyone need to be told this? And how does the formula help? </p>
<p>I had thought that the message was something much more sophisticated. So I checked <cite>LessWrong</cite>, the main pop Bayesian web site. Its article “<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1to/what_is_bayesianism/">What is Bayesianism?↗︎︎</a>” defines it as “a mindset that takes three core tenets fully into account”:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any given observation has many different possible causes.</li>
<li>How we interpret <em>any</em> event, and the new information we get from anything, depends on information we <em>already</em> had.</li>
<li>We can use the concept of probability to measure our subjective belief in something. Furthermore, we can apply the mathematical laws regarding probability to choosing between different beliefs. If we want our beliefs to be correct, we <em>must</em> do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tenets 1 and 2 are obvious (I hope!), and pretty much what Galef said. Tenet 3 I agree with, except for the word “must.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_g67qok2" id="extra29_footnoteref2_g67qok2" title="The technical critique I mention below would explain why that is wrong.">2</a></p>
<p>The leaders of the movement presumably do understand probability. But I’m wondering whether they simply use Bayes’ formula to intimidate lesser minds into accepting “don’t be so sure of your beliefs.” (In which case, Bayesianism <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html">is not about↗︎︎</a> Bayes’ Rule, after all.)</p>
<p>I don’t think I’d approve of that. “Don’t be so sure” is a valuable lesson, but I’d rather teach it <a href="#chap9">in a way people can understand</a>, rather than by invoking a Holy Mystery.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_debunkingbayesianism">Debunking Bayesianism</h2>
<p>I had been thinking about writing a fairly sophisticated, technical explanation of where Bayesianism goes wrong. I’d like to point in a more productive direction.</p>
<p>I haven’t done that yet because <em>actual</em> Bayesianism is a bit technical. It’s a metaphysical interpretation of probability theory. It’s not really difficult, but a clear explanation would take some work.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_73duwea" id="extra29_footnoteref3_73duwea" title="This explanation would not advocate frequentism as an alternative. I’m not interested in that metaphysical controversy. Rather, I’d argue that Bayes’ Rule is not usefully applicable in ways Bayesians want to believe it is.">3</a></p>
<p>Galef is a prominent proponent of pop Bayesianism. My startledness at her video was realizing that none of what I was going to say is relevant. Evidently, the pop version is cruder than I thought. Evidently, I had been taking its allusions to advanced probability theory too seriously.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_f2mdhu6" id="extra29_footnoteref4_f2mdhu6" title="A chain of large belief-strength updates ensued!">4</a> </p>
<p>Evidently, quite a different response is needed.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_doesbayesianismmatter">Does Bayesianism matter?</h2>
<p>Maybe Bayesianism is like acupuncture. It has little practical value, and its elaborate theoretical framework is nonsense; but it’s mostly harmless, and it makes people feel better about themselves, so it’s good on balance. Also, it’s odd enough that few people are going to waste time and money on it. Some quack medical systems ought to be suppressed, but it’s probably best to leave acupuncture alone.</p>
<p>My worry, though, is that Bayesianism may have exactly the wrong effect: it makes people over-confident about their beliefs, because they think Sacred Mathematics justifies them. Empirically, pop Bayesians do often seem confident of things that seem highly unlikely to me.</p>
<p>On my <dfn>Memetic Threat Assessment Scale</dfn><sup>™</sup>, Bayesianism scores only  2/10, vs. 8/10 for “<a href="#extra1">All Is One</a>,”—a much more serious danger. So maybe I’m wasting your time by writing about it here.</p>
<p>My baffled fascination may be purely personal. I interact with many Bayesians on the net, and have come to love some of them. They tend to be smart, kind, unusual people. Bayesianism somehow appeals hugely to people who are <em>like me</em> in most ways. Yet it’s a near miss: my brain is not <em>quite</em> susceptible to infection with this meme.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_bayesianismaseternalism">Bayesianism as eternalism</h2>
<p>Pop Bayesianism is a manifestation of <dfn>non-theistic <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a></dfn>. The obvious eternalisms are explicitly religious, like Christianity. Non-theistic eternalisms are also common, but more insidious because they are less obvious. Bayesianism behaves like a religion in many ways, yet it is anti-supernatural.</p>
<p>Atheism and naturalism are a good start, but only the first steps in freeing yourself from eternalism. Beliefs about God are false, but factual wrongness is not the biggest problem with Christianity. It’s the eternalist emotional dynamics—and I see a lot of those in Bayesianism as well.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that eternalism remains emotionally compelling even after you’ve rejected God. The hope that salvation is possible through Rationality is squarely eternalistic.</p>
<p>I may write more about that soon. What do you think? Would that be interesting?</p>
<ul class="footnotes"><li class="footnote" id="extra29_footnote1_tqb8tco"><a class="footnote-label" href="#extra29_footnoteref1_tqb8tco">1.</a> I suspect it is metaphysics that stops Bayesians from teaching probability in an understandable way. Gian-Carlo Rota, who taught probability at MIT when I was there, would frequently exclaim “It’s all just balls into boxes!” You can solve any probability problem easily if you look at it that way. This presentation is “frequentist,” though, which Bayesians reject on metaphysical grounds. I would suggest that, if you are committed to Bayesian metaphysics, it would still be best to teach “balls into boxes” first, because it makes the calculations easy. <em>Then</em> you can explain that frequentism is the root of all evil, and Bayesian metaphysics is the One True Way to salvation.</li>

<p>This site concerns <em>ways of thinking</em> about some particularly important things: purpose, self, ethics, authority, and meaning, for instance. My aim is to point out common mistakes in thinking about those things, and how to do better.</p>
<p>I enjoy thinking about thinking. That’s one reason <a href="#extra5_AI">I spent a dozen years</a> in artificial intelligence research. To make a computer think, you’d need to understand how <em>you</em> think. So AI research is a way of thinking about thinking that forces you to be specific. It calls your bluff if you think you understand thinking, but don’t.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about <em>how</em> to do AI. <a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_eoko0ur" id="extra29_footnoteref1_eoko0ur" title="That was thinking about thinking about thinking. “Anything you can do, I can do meta,” AI folks often say. But I can do it meta meta!">1</a> In 1988, I put together “<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/misc/how-to.pdf">How to do research at the MIT AI Lab↗︎︎</a>,” a guide for graduate students. Although I edited it, it was a collaboration of many people. There are now many similar guides, some of them better, but this was the first. Most of its advice was not specific to AI or MIT, and for many years after I got emails with thanks from researchers in all sorts of different fields.</p>
<p>Soon after, I realized that AI was a dead end, and left the field. Although my work in AI was influential, it seemed worthless in retrospect. I had a personal crisis: what should I do instead? The feedback on “How to do research” suggested that my thoughts about how to think would be useful more widely. And, I had worked in various fields besides AI, which had their own ways of thinking. My perspective was uncommonly broad. </p>
<p>Maybe the most useful thing I could do would be to write a book about how to think? I began. My jokey placeholder title was “How To Think Real Good.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_isctwbq" id="extra29_footnoteref2_isctwbq" title="My dissertation advisor wrote a book that got translated into Russian, and then translated back into English with the title “How To Hack Lisp Real Good”. He thought that was very funny and posted it on his office door.">2</a> I had a lot of ideas and some sketchy notes, but wound up abandoning the project.</p>
<h3>LessWrong</h3>
<p>This post was prompted by <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/">discussions↗︎︎</a> about <a href="#extra8">Bayesianism</a> and the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong↗︎︎</a> rationalist community. “How To Do AI,” like LW, was a broad collaboration. “How To Think Real Good” would probably also have become a community effort. All three projects were about how to think, with an emphasis on technical methods.</p>
<p>My fascination and frustration with LW comes from my long-standing interest in the same general project, plus liking much of what LW does, plus disliking some of it, plus the sense that LW simply overlooks <em>most</em> of what goes into effective, accurate thinking. LW suggests (sometimes, not always) that Bayesian probability is the main tool for effective, accurate thinking. I think it is only a small part of what you need.</p>
<p>I’ve been making myself <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/">obnoxious↗︎︎</a> by <a href="#extra8">griping about this</a>, without explaining most of what my beef is. Several clarifying dialogues with LW community members have resulted. One question has come up repeatedly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If not Bayesianism, then what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implicit assumption is that the problem Bayesianism solves is <em>most of rationality</em>, and if I’m unimpressed with Bayesianism, I must advocate some other solution to that problem. I do have technical doubts about Bayesianism, but that’s not my point. Rather, I think that the problem Bayesianism addresses is a small and easy one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bayesianism is a theory of <em>probability</em>.</li>
<li>Probability is only a small part of <em>epistemology</em>.</li>
<li>Probability <a href="#chap69">is only a small part</a> of <em>rationality</em>.</li>
<li>Probability is a solved problem. It’s easy. The remaining controversies in the field are arcane and rarely have any practical consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>My answer to “If not Bayesianism, then what?” is: <em>all of human intellectual effort</em>. Figuring out how things work, what’s true or false, what’s effective or useless, is “human complete.” In other words, it’s unboundedly difficult, and every human intellectual faculty must be brought to bear.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_7nynjpn" id="extra29_footnoteref3_7nynjpn" title="The analogy is with NP-completeness.">3</a> We could call the study of that enterprise “epistemology”; and “rationality” is a collection of methods for it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_c1pemun" id="extra29_footnoteref4_c1pemun" title="Neither term is well-defined. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy gives two definitions for epistemology. The narrow definition is the study of “justified true belief”—an impoverished and unworkable framework. The wide definition is “issues in the creation and dissemination of knowledge in particular areas of inquiry.” “Rationality” is even less well defined, but often involves the use of formal, mathematical tools. This post is mostly about that.">4</a></p>
<p>Mostly, we have no idea how people figure things out. The answer is certainly not going to be some simple bit of math like Bayes’ Rule. We’re not going to get a complete story any time soon. What we <em>can</em> do—what I was hoping to do with “How to think real good”—is find heuristics; rules of thumb that often work in particular sorts of situations.</p>
<h3>Like what?</h3>
<p>In response to which, some LessWrong contributors rightly replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <em>what</em>? Be specific!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A proper answer would be a book (which would require suitable collaborators, and many more years of thinking about thinking with them).</p>
<p>What follows below is, I’m afraid, an off-the-cuff brain dump. I haven’t thought about “How to think real good” in 20 years, and have forgotten whatever I’d worked out then. [<i>Update, years later</i>: However, I have returned to the topic repeatedly—for instance in posts on <a href="#extra12">meta-rationality</a>.]</p>
<p>To be specific, I’ll tell some anecdotes about thinking. These concentrate on the application of formal methods of thought, mostly because that’s LW’s orientation. This is probably a wrong emphasis; most insights result from informal reasoning and observation, not technical rationality.</p>
<p class="anvil">Understanding informal reasoning is probably more important than understanding technical methods.</p>
<p>That’s an <dfn><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious moral↗︎︎</a></dfn>—an unsubtle take-away message. It’s rude to point these out so <strong>boldly</strong>, but I thought it might be useful to create a set of topics that a broader discussion of effective thinking could expand on. The list is totally unsystematic and certainly not exhaustive. Mostly I’ll provide no evidence or even explanation for these morals. And, they are probably annoyingly non-specific. Each one could expand into a book.</p>
<p>The anecdotes concern academic research, because that’s what “How to think real good” was going to be about. Nowadays, I’m more interested in the everyday understanding of non-academics. That’s the subject of <cite>Meaningness</cite>, and largely of LW too.</p>
<p>The anecdotes also concern research projects that I took part in, <em>not</em> because those are particularly good examples, but because they come easily to mind. We could do a better job by studying diverse examples of technical progress, but I don’t have time for that now.</p>
<p>Before the anecdotes, I’ll talk in general about <dfn>problem formulation</dfn>, because that’s an aspect of epistemology and rationality that I find particularly important, and that the Bayesian framework <em>entirely ignores</em>.</p>
<p>It happens that I’m not especially good at solving problems (at least, not as compared with other MIT PhDs). I’m unusually good at selecting and formulating them. So, I’m biased.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_formulation">Problem formulation</h2>
<p>Many of the heuristics I collected for “How to think real good” were about how to take an unstructured, vague problem domain and get it to the point where formal methods become applicable.</p>
<p>Formal methods all require a formal specification of the problem. For example, before you can apply Bayesian methods, you have to specify what all the hypotheses are, what sorts of events constitute “evidence,” how you can recognize one of those events, and (in a decision theoretic framework) what the possible actions are. Bayesianism takes these <em>as given</em>, and has nothing to say about how you choose them. Once you <em>have</em> chosen them, applying the Bayesian framework is trivial. (It’s just arithmetic, for godssakes!)</p>
<p class="anvil">Finding a good formulation for a problem is often most of the work of solving it.</p>
<p>A bewildered Bayesian might respond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should consider <em>all</em> hypotheses and types of evidence! Omitting some means you might get the wrong answer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, there are too many. Suppose you want to understand the cause of manic depression. For every grain of sand in the universe, there is the hypothesis that this particular grain of sand is the sole cause of manic depression. Finding evidence to rule out each one individually is impractical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, obviously, all grains of sand are equivalent as far as manic depression is concerned! And anyway, sand <em>obviously</em> has nothing to do with manic depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes; but this is not <em>logically</em> necessary. It’s something we can reasonably suppose. But how do we do that? It requires intelligent background understanding.</p>
<p>This is something we have to do <em>without explicit thought</em>. We could consider and reject sand as a possible cause, but there is an infinite list of other <em>logically possible</em> causes. (Variations in the density of the letter “t” in Austrian government documents; chemical reactions that occur only above 873 kelvin; creatures that, at a distance, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Emporium_of_Benevolent_Knowledge">resemble flies↗︎︎</a>, or are drawn with a very fine camel hair brush.) We can’t even imagine them all, much less evaluate the evidence for them.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p class="anvil">Before applying any technical method, you have to <em>already</em> have a pretty good idea of what the form of the answer will be.</p>
<p>Part of a “pretty good idea” is a <dfn>vocabulary</dfn> for describing relevant factors. Any situation can be described in infinitely many ways. For example, my thinking right now could be described as an elementary particle configuration, as molecules in motion, as neurons firing, as sentences, as part of a conversation, as primate signaling behavior, as a point in world intellectual history, and so on.</p>
<p class="anvil">Choosing a good vocabulary, at the right level of description, is usually key to understanding.</p>
<p>A good vocabulary has to do two things. Let’s make them anvils:</p>
<p class="anvil">1. A successful problem formulation has to make the distinctions that are used in the problem solution.</p>
<p>So it mustn’t categorize together things that are relevantly different. Trying to find an explanation of manic depression stated only in terms of emotions is unlikely to work, because emotions, though relevant, are “too big” as categories. “Sadness” is probably a complex phenomenon with many different aspects that get collapsed together in that word.</p>
<p class="anvil">2. A successful problem formulation has to make the problem small enough that it’s easy to solve.</p>
<p>Trying to find an explanation of manic depression in terms of brain state vectors in which each element is the membrane potential of an individual neuron probably won’t work. That description is much too complicated. It makes billions of distinctions that are almost certainly irrelevant. It doesn’t collapse the state space <em>enough</em>; the categories are too small and therefore too numerous.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that problem formulations are never right or wrong. </p>
<p class="anvil">Truth does not apply to problem formulations; what matters is usefulness.</p>
<p>In fact,</p>
<p class="anvil"><em>All</em> problem formulations are “false,” because they abstract away details of reality.</p>
<p id="extra29_objects">Any vocabulary pretends that the world is made of objectively separable “objects” (molecules, neurons, emotions, brains, conversations), with well-defined properties. But there <em>are no objects</em> in the real world.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_mq5utn8" id="extra29_footnoteref5_mq5utn8" title="Not above the level of elementary particles, anyway.">5</a></p>
<p>This is going to be a major point in <cite>Meaningness</cite>; I’ve just begun to discuss it <a href="#chap95">here</a>. Since I haven’t had time yet to explain, let me quote Richard Feynman instead:</p>
<blockquote id="extra29_feynman-objects">
<p>Consider an object… What is an object? Philosophers are always saying, “Well, just take a chair for example.” The moment they say that, you know that they do not know what they are talking about. Atoms are evaporating from it from time to time; dirt falls on it and gets dissolved in the paint; so to define a chair precisely, to say exactly which atoms are chair, and which atoms are air, or which atoms are dirt, or which atoms are paint is impossible… </p>
<p>There are not any single, left-alone objects in the world—every object is a mixture of a lot of things, so we can deal with it only as a series of approximations and idealizations.</p>
<p>The trick is the idealizations. One may prefer a mathematical definition; but those can never work in the real world. A mathematical definition will be good for mathematics, in which all the logic can be followed out completely, but the physical world is [too] complex. When we try to isolate pieces of it, to talk about one mass, the wine and the glass, how can we know which is which, when one dissolves in the other? </p>
<p>A system of discourse about the real world must involve approximations of some kind. This is quite unlike the case of mathematics, in which everything can be defined.</p>
<p>—<cite><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bDF-uoUmttUC&amp;pg=SA12-PA2&amp;lpg=SA12-PA2&amp;dq=%22just+take+a+chair+for+example%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22just%20take%20a%20chair%20for%20example%22&amp;f=false">The Feynman Lectures on Physics↗︎︎</a></cite>, Vol. 1: p. 12-2; some phrases omitted for concision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I should probably just shut up and quote Feynman! His books are full of insights into thinking, and how formal methods work in practice.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_me37tot" id="extra29_footnoteref6_me37tot" title="And he was the most important physicist of the mid-20th century, which makes him harder to argue with than me!">6</a></p>
<p>Anyway, <em>the trick is the idealizations</em>—the ways you simplify and abstract away from reality to create a conceptual framework within which you can work on the problem. There’s no such thing as a <em>correct</em> idealization; what you need is one that’s good for a particular job.</p>
<p>There’s an obvious difficulty here: if you don’t know the solution to a problem, how do you know whether your vocabulary makes the distinctions it needs? The answer is: you can’t be sure; but there are many heuristics that make finding a good formulation more likely. Here are two very general ones:</p>
<p class="anvil">Work through several specific examples before trying to solve the general case. Looking at specific real-world details often gives an intuitive sense for what the relevant distinctions are.</p>
<p class="anvil">Problem formulation and problem solution are mutually-recursive processes.</p>
<p>You need to go back and forth between trying to formulate the problem and trying to solve it. A “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall↗︎︎</a>” approach, in which you take the formulation as set in stone and just try to solve it, is rarely effective.</p>
<p>The difficulty then is that you have to recognize incremental progress in both the formulation and the solution. It’s rare that you can use formal methods to evaluate that progress. So a planned major topic in “How to think real good” was informal, or intuitive, ways to evaluate progress.</p>
<p class="anvil">Heuristics for evaluating progress are critical not only during problem solving, but also during problem formulation.</p>
<p>A highly general one:</p>
<p class="anvil">Solve a simplified version of the problem first. If you can’t do even that, you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>A medium-specificity heuristic, applicable mainly in computer science:</p>
<p class="anvil">If you are having a hard time, make sure you aren’t trying to solve an NP-complete problem. If you are, go back and look for additional sources of constraint in the real-world domain.</p>
<h2>Rationality without probability</h2>
<p>When I say “Bayesian methods are a tiny fraction of rationality,” somehow people don’t get it. So let’s look at an example, taken from <a href="http://mit.dspace.org/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6947/AITR-802.pdf?sequence=2">my Master’s thesis↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>I was interested in “classical planning,” a technical problem in robotics research. Let’s say you have a robot that can only do one thing at a time, and you want to get it to make several things true at once. The classic example is: suppose there are three children’s blocks sitting on a table: red, green, and blue. The robot can pick up one block at a time and put it on another block. You want a stack with the red block on the green block, and the green block on the blue block. That’s two things (red on green, green on blue) you want to be true simultaneously. The robot could put the red block on the green block, accomplishing the first condition, but then it would be stuck, because the green block has to go on the blue block, and it can only move one block.</p>
<p>Apparently, the robot has to plan ahead. It needs to figure out that it has to move the green block first. More generally, classical planning means finding an ordered sequence of actions that accomplish several goals at once. Once you’ve got that, you can execute the plan mindlessly, like running a program.</p>
<p>Before my Master’s work, dozens of researchers had tackled the problem, and built complex heuristic planning systems that no one understood well, and that didn’t always work. I produced a simple planning algorithm that I proved always worked (and so definitively solved the problem). This involved a year of agony and false starts and half-right attempts. It might be interesting to go back through my lab notebook of the time to analyze how I eventually succeeded. </p>
<p>However, <em>part</em> of the process is reflected in my solution, and I intend to draw some anvilicious morals from it. (This analysis is quite technical. You can skip ahead to the morals if you like.)</p>
<p>The algorithm constructs a plan incrementally as a partial order on actions. When it discovers a constraint on what has to happen before what, it adds an arc to the time-order digraph.</p>
<p>The key insight is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic">modal↗︎︎</a> extension of temporal logic to partial time orders. The “necessary” operator corresponds to a proposition holding in <em>all totalizations</em> of the partial order; “possibly” corresponds to a proposition holding in <em>some</em> totalization. The algorithm depends on a <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/">model theory↗︎︎</a> that makes it possible to compute possible and necessary truth in polynomial time.</p>
<p>Given this logic, proving that the planner is complete (it can always find a plan if there is one) and correct (its claimed plans always work) corresponds closely to demonstrating the completeness and soundness of a proof theory.</p>
<p>Morals?</p>
<p class="anvil">You can never know enough mathematics.</p>
<p>I wasn’t smarter than the other people who worked on this problem. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman">Gerry Sussman↗︎︎</a>’s PhD thesis was one of the major previous works.) I happened to have taken several advanced courses in mathematical logic (due to my interest in rationality), and it happened to be the case that the classical planning problem was easy once it was recast in logical terms. Probably none of the previous researchers in the field happened to have that background.</p>
<p>Put another way,</p>
<p class="anvil">An education in math is a better preparation for a career in intellectual field X than an education in X.</p>
<p>I thought Paul Graham said that, but I can’t find it on his web site. The <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hs.html">closest I can find↗︎︎</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you're a college freshman deciding whether to major in math or economics. Well, math will give you more options: you can go into almost any field from math. If you major in math it will be easy to get into grad school in economics, but if you major in economics it will be hard to get into grad school in math.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[<i>Update, three years later:</i> I’ve found it! <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070702141846/http://www.rota.org/hotair/mitless.html">It was Gian-Carlo Rota↗︎︎</a>: “When an undergraduate asks me whether he or she should major in mathematics rather than in another field that I will simply call X, my answer is the following: ‘If you major in mathematics, you can switch to X anytime you want to, but not the other way around’.”]</p>
<p>It was mostly dumb luck that modal logic and model theory turned out to be relevant to classical planning. If other people had realized they were relevant, they could have solved the problem years earlier. So:</p>
<p class="anvil">You should learn as many different kinds of math as possible. It’s difficult to predict what sort will be relevant to a problem.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> heuristics for guessing what formal methods will be relevant, though. I’ll mention some later.</p>
<h3>Look, Ma, no Bayes!</h3>
<p>Before moving on: observations about Bayesianism and rationality, at two levels. </p>
<p>First, the classical planning problem is definitely a problem of rationality. Putting the red block on the green block first is irrational; putting the green block on the blue block first is rational. This is a problem Bayes won’t help with <em>at all</em>. </p>
<p>My solution was also surely an example of formal rationality; mathematical logic is the <em>standard</em> for that. But it involves no probability theory of any sort.</p>
<p>At the meta level: the year of hard thinking I did to solve the classical planning problem involved huge uncertainties. Was a general solution even possible? What sort of approach would work? Was I on the right track, as I pursued various alternatives? But none of these uncertainties could usefully be modeled with probabilities, I think. The issues were way too <em>amorphous</em> for that.</p>
<p>At any rate, I certainly wasn’t aware of using probabilistic reasoning. It’s possible that I used it unconsciously.</p>
<p>I find it problematic, though, when Bayesians posit unconscious probabilistic reasoning as an explanation for rationality in cases where there is no evidence. This is dangerously close to “the God of the gaps”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have no other explanation for the Big Bang (consciousness, ethics, whatever), <em>therefore God did it</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t know quite how you solved that problem, <em>therefore you used Bayes</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Reformulating rational action</h2>
<p>My next example comes from work with Phil Agre, which led to both our PhD theses. Phil had an extraordinary series of insights into how effective action is possible (with some contributions from me).</p>
<p>In my Master’s thesis, I had proven that there can be no <em>efficient</em> solution to the classical planning problem. (Formally, it’s NP-complete.) Since people obviously do act rationally, this seemed a paradox.</p>
<p>One of Agre’s insights was that the problem formulation was wrong. That is, the classical planning problem is dissimilar to most actual situations in which people act rationally. </p>
<p class="anvil">If a problem seems too hard, the formulation is probably wrong. Drop your formal problem statement, go back to reality, and <em>observe</em> what is going on.</p>
<p>Phil and I spent a couple years in careful observation, recording, and analysis of people actually doing things. From that, we developed an entirely <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1987/AAAI87-048.pdf">different way of thinking about action↗︎︎</a>—both what the problem is, and how to address it.</p>
<p>We applied as many different intellectual tools as we could find. In the end, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnomethodology">ethnomethodology↗︎︎</a>, an anthropological approach to describing action, was the single most useful. We also drew on (among others) Gibson’s perceptual psychology and Heidegger’s phenomenology of tool use. Each of these fields is highly “technical” in the sense of having elaborate, non-obvious methods, but none is “formal” in a mathematical sense.</p>
<p class="anvil">Learn from fields very different from your own. They each have ways of thinking that can be useful at surprising times. Just learning to think like an anthropologist, a psychologist, and a philosopher will beneficially stretch your mind.</p>
<p id="extra29_IRIFOY">One key idea came from a cookbook. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0395322162/?tag=meaningness-20">Fear of Cooking↗︎︎</a> emphasizes “the IRIFOY principle”: <em>it’s right in front of you</em>. You know what scrambled eggs are supposed to be like; you can see what is happening in the pan; so you know what you need to do next. You don’t need to make a detailed plan ahead of time.</p>
<p>IRIFOY doesn’t always work; sometimes you paint yourself in a corner if you don’t think ahead. But mostly that doesn’t happen; and Phil developed a deep theory of why it doesn’t. One aspect is: we can’t solve NP-complete problems, so we organize our lives (and our physical environments) so we don’t have to.</p>
<h3>Dealing effectively with uncertainty without using probability</h3>
<p>The classical formulation was unrealistically hard in some ways, but also artificially easy. It did not allow for any sort of uncertainty, for instance. We implemented <a href="#extra5_AI">a series of AI programs</a> that were effective in complex, uncertain domains, where the planning approach failed. These domains involved both inherently random events and limited sensory access to relevant factors.</p>
<p>Our programs dealt competently with uncertainty despite <em>not representing it at all</em>. A Bayesian approach would have been overwhelmed by computational complexity; and belief probabilities wouldn’t have contributed to effective action anyway. This was the IRIFOY principle again: when our programs needed to make decisions, they could <em>actively investigate</em> to see what they needed to know. Most of the facts about their worlds were unknowable, but they could find out enough of what mattered, and ignored the rest. </p>
<p>It’s possible to attribute unconscious Bayesian reasoning to me, but definitely not to our programs. Anyone could look at the code and verify a total absence of probabilities.</p>
<p class="anvil">If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like an anvil. If you only know one formal method of reasoning, you’ll try to apply it in places it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Probability theory is <em>sometimes</em> an excellent way of dealing with uncertainty, but it’s not the only way, and sometimes it’s a terrible way. One reason is that it collapses together many different sources of uncertainty. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>inherent effective randomness, due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">dynamical chaos↗︎︎</a></li>
<li>physical inaccessibility of relevant events</li>
<li>time-varying causes (so samples are drawn from different distributions)</li>
<li>sensing/measurement error/noise</li>
<li>model/abstraction approximations (as Feynman explained)</li>
<li>one's own cognitive/computational limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these can be complex, and often they need to be dealt with in quite different ways. Summing them up in one number is unhelpful.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_how-far">How far will that go?</h3>
<p>The work Phil and I did was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;cites=1539961832122933456&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=SxaOTeeFH4SssAOqpqWDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=science_links&amp;ct=sl-citedby&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCgQzgIwAg">highly influential↗︎︎</a> for a while, and we could have turned that into tenured professorships at top universities. But we both walked away instead. We recognized that our approach could generate five or so years of further work, but would then fizzle out.</p>
<p class="anvil">Evaluate the prospects for your field frequently. Be prepared to switch if it looks like it is approaching its inherent end-point.</p>
<p>One of Feynman’s books has a memorable letter to his wife, written from a cryogenics conference, in which he complains that the field is dying, and he’s bored stiff, but somehow the oblivious cryogenicists are still taking it seriously.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_h32uhb2" id="extra29_footnoteref7_h32uhb2" title="I can’t find this on the web.">7</a> I had this advice in mind when I left AI.</p>
<h2>An AI model of problem formulation</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/user/808">Leslie Kaelbling↗︎︎</a>, working with Stan Rosenschein, independently developed a theory of action similar to Agre’s and mine; and then independently recognized the same limitations we did. Around 1990, she and I hoped these limitations could be overcome using machine learning techniques, and we did many experiments on that, independently and in collaboration.</p>
<p>“Machine learning” is basically a collection of statistical techniques. As with other formal methods, they can work well when a problem is framed in terms that expose relevant features. They don’t work if your formalization of the problem is not good enough. That is fine if you view them as tools a scientist can use to help understand a problem; but our interest was in <em>making minds</em>, autonomous creatures that could figure out how to act effectively by themselves.</p>
<p>We considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning↗︎︎</a> problem. A creature is thrown into a complicated world, and at times given a reward (cookies, or maybe utilons). Initially, it has no idea what conditions cause it to be rewarded, and no idea how to act to bring about those conditions. Through trial and error, can it learn to act effectively in order to maximize its utility?</p>
<p>The relevant framework was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning">temporal difference methods↗︎︎</a>. Those worked well if the experimenter abstracted the world into a handful of input values whose statistical relationship with reward was fairly obvious.</p>
<p>But what we wanted was for the creature to figure out the abstraction itself. We didn’t want to have to formulate the problem; we wanted our program to find its own formulation.</p>
<p>Most sensory information is irrelevant to a task, and should be ignored. (It’s noise, relative to action and reinforcement.) But which are the relevant inputs? Without knowing that, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Learning">then-best available method↗︎︎</a> would be instantly overwhelmed by the combinatorics of a realistically broad flow of sense data.</p>
<p>Our idea was that the creature could incrementally construct a formulation of the problem it faced by recognizing inputs that behaved statistically differently relative to action and reinforcement. Only those were relevant, and should be taken into consideration in figuring out an action policy.</p>
<p>With various refinements, <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;?doi=10.1.1.99.561&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">this worked↗︎︎</a> on problems that previous methods couldn’t handle.</p>
<h3>A little math goes a long way</h3>
<p>When we did this research, neither of us knew much about statistics. In particular, we’d never heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test">↗︎︎</a>, a basic statistical tool.</p>
<p>However, we did know enough about what statistics is <em>about</em>, and its vocabulary, that we could formulate one of our sub-problems statistically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given two sets of samples drawn from distributions D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>, do we have enough data to know whether the two distributions are actually the same or different?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was basically the test for whether a sensory input was relevant to action. And, having described it that way, it took half an hour of flipping through Leslie’s stats text together to find out that Student’s <em>t</em> was the tool for the job.</p>
<p class="anvil">It’s more important to know what a branch of math is <em>about</em> than to know the details. You can look those up, if you realize that you need them.</p>
<p>Combined with the earlier moral that it’s good to know many kinds of math, this suggests:</p>
<p class="anvil">Get a superficial understanding of as many kinds of math as possible. That can be enough that you will recognize when one applies, even if you don’t know how to use it.</p>
<p>Quite possibly the <em>t</em>-test was actually the “wrong” tool for the job. Someone who actually knows statistics might say “Oh, no! You should use Teacher’s <em>u</em>-test, because blah blah.” And they’d be “right”; that might work better, or be more “correct.” But the <em>t</em>-test solved the problem for us: the program worked.</p>
<p class="anvil">Math only has to be “correct” enough to get the job done.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that there are often other, larger sources of error than mathematical details. Approximations are fine in engineering, and even in physics (as Feynman pointed out above). Mathematics <em>never</em> perfectly describes the real world.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_9pterec" id="extra29_footnoteref8_9pterec" title="A unified field theory would, but only at a level that is useless for nearly all practical purposes.">8</a> Quoting “How to do research”:</p>
<p class="anvil">You should be able to prove theorems and you should harbor doubts about whether theorems prove anything.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s often good to go on to figure out the “right” answer; it might be important for other, related jobs. Or it might just be interesting for its own sake.</p>
<h2>Surface thinking</h2>
<p>After I decided that “strong” AI research (making minds) was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Possible_explanations_for_the_slow_progress_of_AI_research">going nowhere↗︎︎</a>, and after the “what should I do with my life!?!” existential crisis, I figured I’d apply what I knew to something actually useful. Pharmaceutical drug discovery (finding new medicines) seemed the best bet.</p>
<p>Drugs work by fitting into slots in proteins. This is called the “lock and key” model: a particular protein slot has a very specific shape, and how well a molecule works depends on how nearly it fills the hole.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_1yquf2s" id="extra29_footnoteref9_1yquf2s" title="And on charge distribution, and other factors; I’m simplifying this story because otherwise it will take forever, and you don’t care.">9</a> If you know the shape of the slot, you can design molecules to fit. But often you don’t know. Instead, you have a collection of molecules that don’t fit very well, and some that don’t fit at all, and you want to find ones that fit better. </p>
<p>Actually making and testing new molecules is expensive—and the number of possible molecules is infinite. What you’d like is a statistical method that would take as input a set of molecules with known degrees of fit, and could predict how well a hypothetical new molecule would fit.</p>
<p>I worked on this problem in a team in the early ‘90s. Many of our conceptual advances were due to <a href="http://www.jainlab.org/people.html">Ajay Jain↗︎︎</a>, who is perhaps the best problem solver I’ve collaborated with. I learned a lot from him. </p>
<p>I’ve found that pretty smart people are all smart in pretty much the same way, but <em>extremely</em> smart people have unique cognitive styles, which are their special “edge.” </p>
<p class="anvil">Try to figure out how people smarter than you think.</p>
<p class="anvil">Figure out what your own cognitive style is. Embrace and develop it as your secret weapon; but try to learn and appreciate other styles as well.</p>
<p>What I observed about Ajay is that he always went for the simplest, most obvious, least interesting approach, and made it work. That is not my style at all; I’m addicted to “interesting” approaches. Those usually wind up as baroque failures. Maybe I’m less prone to that after watching Ajay cut through complexity.</p>
<p>There’s a quote I’d like to include here that goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every supposed genius has a bag of tricks—a list of obscure technical methods that hardly anyone knows about, that they have mastered. Every time they hear about a problem, they go through the list mentally, to see if one of the tricks might work. They hardly ever do, but once every year or two, you get a match, and then you look brilliant, like you’ve had some staggering insight. But actually all you did was notice that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory↗︎︎</a> is applicable, or something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I thought Feynman said this, or maybe Gian-Carlo Rota, but I can’t find it.) Percolation theory was actually one of <a href="http://longnow.org/people/board/danny0/">Danny Hillis↗︎︎</a>’ tricks. I never saw him use it, but we used to compare our lists, and that one came up a couple of times. It stuck in my mind, and I’ve been hoping to find an application ever since. </p>
<p>Rota’s best trick was a method for solving a class of elliptic integrals that no one else could crack. These happened to come up a lot in hydrogen bomb design, so once every few months he’d fly to Los Alamos on a military jet and be locked in a room with some top-secret equations. He wasn’t allowed to take them away, of course, but he also refused to explain his method. He’d solve them entirely in his head and just write down the answers. He was paid well for this… I think I may have wandered off-topic.</p>
<p class="anvil">Collect your bag of tricks.</p>
<p id="extra29_rota_principles">Rota was the only professor I had who would actually explain how math works and how to do it. For some reason, mathematicians find that extremely embarrassing, like talking about their bowel movements or something, and they absolutely refuse to discuss it.</p>
<p>...Wait a minute! I’ve just found Rota’s “<a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html">Ten lessons I wish I had been taught↗︎︎</a>,” which includes the “bag of tricks” idea. It’s very funny, and has some good advice. (And it <em>was</em> Feynman, by the way! Except Feynman did it the other way around: keep a list of unsolved problems, and check them against any new technique you learn about.)</p>
<p class="anvil">Find a teacher who is willing to go meta and explain how a field works, instead of lecturing you on its subject matter.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_45k727j" id="extra29_footnoteref10_45k727j" title="This is why I am a student of Ngak’chang Rinpoche, who is the only Buddhist teacher I’ve met who can do that.">10</a></p>
<p>So anyway, back to drugs. Medicinal chemists think about a molecule in terms of its connectivity graph: its atoms and covalent bonds. That is <em>entirely irrelevant</em> to whether or not it fits into a hole. So, naturally, medicinal chemists are bad at predicting whether a molecule will work, and that is one of many reasons that pharmaceutical research is unbelievably inefficient. </p>
<p>Computational chemists had developed predictive models that also depended on the connectivity graph, and naturally didn’t work either. This despite the fact that everyone knew that what actually matters is the 3D shape.</p>
<p>This is an example of problem formulation failure. Thinking about molecular fit in terms of connectivity was doomed from the outset, because that vocabulary does not capture the relevant distinctions (shapes), and makes a lot of irrelevant distinctions (graph topologies).</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty was that no one had a good idea about how to represent shape. One academic group <em>had</em> developed a prediction method based on shape, but it worked only barely better than the connectivity-based methods. It used a Cartesian occupancy grid to represent shape. In other words, it had a large number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxels↗︎︎</a>, checked each to see whether it was inside or outside the molecule, and used that as the input to the statistical method. This didn’t work well. If the grid was fine enough to discriminate shape accurately enough, the number of voxels was so large that it would cause statistical overfitting.</p>
<p>Ajay invented a much better shape representation, blindingly obvious in retrospect. (This was an instance of his trying the simplest thing first, and finding it worked.) It simply consisted of the distances from each of a set of fixed reference points to the nearest point on molecule’s surface. </p>
<p>One reason this worked (dramatically well, <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/kkoile/papers/compass94.pdf">we showed↗︎︎</a>) was that <em>every</em> measurement was directly relevant to what matters: the shape of the surface. In the voxel grid representation, nearly every measurement either tells you “this voxel is not part of the molecule” (in which case you don’t care) or “this voxel is somewhere inside the molecule” (but probably not on the surface, so again it doesn’t matter).</p>
<p>So this is another instance of the principle that a good problem formulation is one that exposes the information relevant to the solution, and eliminates information that is irrelevant and results in meaningless complexity.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Violating my main advice, this rambling brain dump included lots of irrelevant details (like how drugs work), and also failed to expose most of the key information you’d want (like interestingly specific heuristics for figuring stuff out).</p>
<p>In an attempt to salvage <em>some</em> value, let me try and make some of the main points again, concisely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring stuff out is <em>way</em> hard.</li>
<li>There is no general method.</li>
<li>Selecting and formulating problems is as important as solving them; these each require different cognitive skills.</li>
<li>Problem formulation (vocabulary selection) requires careful, non-formal observation of the real world.</li>
<li>A good problem formulation includes the relevant distinctions, and abstracts away irrelevant ones. This makes problem solution easy.</li>
<li>Little formal tricks (like Bayesian statistics) may be useful, but any one of them is only a tiny part of what you need.</li>
<li>Progress usually requires applying several methods. Learn as many different ones as possible.</li>
<li>Meta-level knowledge of how a field works—which methods to apply to which sorts of problems, and how and why—is critical (and harder to get). </li>
</ul>
<p>If I had more time, I could do better. But, figuring out how to figure stuff out is <em>even way harder</em>. This is where the LessWrong internet collaborative approach shines brilliantly. It really needs to be a community effort.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The New Age promised an Aquarian Revolution: a total, global transformation of consciousness. It has not delivered, as yet.  I suspect, on the contrary, that the Age of Aquarius is drawing to an end.</p>
<p>The New Age was a response to particular historical circumstances that have passed.  Understanding its appeal and limits may cast light on the emerging “pop spirituality,” which is similar in some ways and critically different in others.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_l0hql4z" id="extra29_footnoteref1_l0hql4z" title="What I write in this page is impressionistic, and unsupported by any specific evidence.

<!--break-->
<p>The New Age developed as an alternative to the restrictive, consensus 1950s world-view the Baby Boomers grew up in. In religion, the only 1950s choices were Christian and Jewish sects. In politics and economics, the only choices were capitalism and communism, which were seen as monolithic opposing ideologies. In society, the ideal was a nuclear two-parent heterosexual family with 2.3 children.  Advances in science, technology, and industrial production made the idea of material Progress as an inevitable force compelling.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_7bdocbg" id="extra29_footnoteref2_7bdocbg" title="Of course, there were some people who rejected all these. However, they were a tiny marginal minority; whereas by 1990 alternatives had mass appeal.">2</a></p>
<p>Although some of these systems are superficially opposed, they all are forms of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalist</a> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss1')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a>.  “Eternalist” means that they see meaning as provided by an unchanging transcendent order.  “Dualist” means that they uphold various hard-line distinctions. People are individuals clearly separated from each other; from nature; and from divinity. Definite choices must be made between competing systems, which must be either right or wrong. Social groups—classes, countries, races—are immutably different, and inherently conflicting.</p>
<p>Many in the Baby Boom generation rejected this consensus, and sought other systems.  Mostly, the alternatives they found were forms of eternalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a>.  These systems also see meaning as derived from a transcendent order (eternalism), but assert that the supposed separations of dualism are illusory (monism). Among dozens of other systems, astrology, parapsychology, eco-spirituality, quantum mysticism, and naturopathy—despite addressing quite different subjects—share this underlying philosophy. The phrase “New Age” was popularized as an umbrella term to cover them all.  Despite the “New” in the name, these systems mainly developed in Nineteenth Century Europe, influenced by <a href="#extra1">German Romantic Idealism</a>.</p>
<p>These monist systems are based on accurate insights into the errors of dualism. None of the separations dualism imposes are absolute.  Insisting that these lines cannot be crossed is a major source of misery.</p>
<p>Alternative models of healing were a major part of the New Age’s appeal.  Mainstream medicine’s ideology is dualist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>. The body is a machine that sometimes needs adjustment; the mind is entirely separate from it and irrelevant to its function; spirit is non-existent.  Conversely, dualist eternalism sees the body as inherently morally corrupt; something to be disciplined, neglected, or repudiated.  Both approaches came to seem quite wrong.</p>
<a id="extra29_problem" name="problem"><h2>The problem with the New Age</h2></a>
<p>The problem with the New Age is that you have to believe and do stupid things.  Mostly its specific systems are silly, if you take details seriously.  This has limited its growth.  Most people have little patience with crystal healing and angelic spirit guides from Atlantis.  (Or whatever is happening in the <a href="http://failblog.org/">FAIL photo↗︎︎</a> at the top of this page.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_lfr1re2" id="extra29_footnoteref3_lfr1re2" title="This is an internet joke meme: superimposing “FAIL” on images illustrating idiocy.">3</a>)</p>
<p>A few New Age adherents are seriously committed to a specific system.  They spend years studying a complex, intellectually pretentious theoretical framework.</p>
<p>Most New Agers, though, hold to individual systems only lightly.  They flit from one alternative healing method to another; they claim to believe in several incompatible religions at once; their actual lifestyles have little to do with their professed ideals.</p>
<p>For most New Agers, details are irrelevant.  The specifics are, in fact, Nineteenth Century historical baggage.</p>
<p>For the client of a New Age healer, the mumbo-jumbo doesn’t matter.  What is important is the healer’s recognition of the client as a whole person—body, mind, and spirit—who is also inseparably connected with all living beings.  What qualifies the healer is not conceptual knowledge of astrological charts, maps of energy channels, or the pairwise interactions of flower essences.  What qualifies the healer is her deep intuitive connection to the Cosmos as a whole.</p>
<p>Allegiance to the New Age is based on rejection of the only apparent alternatives: eternalist and nihilist dualism.  If those are wrong, it may seem that monism must be right; and until recently, the New Age was the only available form of monism.</p>
<p>The sticking point is that it is not possible to participate in the New Age without adopting (however lightly or temporarily) one or more of the silly systems that make it up.</p>

Monism sees God more as a first principle, ultimate source, or unifying force, than as a person.  It finds divinity in all things; most importantly, within ourselves.  We are all parts of the one Spirit that encompasses the entire universe.</p>
<p>Monism takes this wholeness as the timeless, universal Truth behind all religions.  Different religions are just different ways of reaching toward that one truth, so all religions are valid at their core.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, religions’ narrow dogmas and empty rituals hide the essential insight.  Nearly all religions are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss1')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a>, meaning that they wrongly insist that divinity is always somewhere else.  They say we are absolutely separated from God, from each other, and from nature.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_dxprn9k" id="extra29_footnoteref2_dxprn9k" title="There are non-dualist religions: some branches of Buddhism and Hinduism, for instance.

<p>My impression is that most SBNRs accept these monist ideas.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_i4gp751" id="extra29_footnoteref3_i4gp751" title="I have no statistics for this; it’s just based on talking with people.

No one tries to convince you to “become a monist,” so most SBNRs will not have heard the term.  To find out how prevalent monism is, numerically, a survey would need to ask people in more detail about their spiritual orientation.">3</a></p>
<p>Why are so many people choosing to be spiritual but not religious?  Put another way, why is monism suddenly <a href="#extra2">going mainstream now</a>?</p>
<p>I think there are three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monism is particularly relevant to current concerns;</li>
<li>The only well-known alternatives are increasingly unattractive;</li>
<li>A new, “system-free” form of monism avoids critical flaws in earlier versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll explain these in turn.</p>
<h2>Why monism now?</h2>
<p>The way we live now is isolating, atomizing, alienating.  We are artificially separated from each other, from nature, and even from our own everyday experience.</p>
<p>These are consequences of the modern social, economic, and technological order.  We recognize that this isolation is unhealthy, unnatural, unsustainable.</p>
<p>We intuit that we are <em>not</em> separate; that we are intrinsically connected with everyone and everything everywhere.  We long for community and for communion; for a return to the sacred.</p>
<p>Religion claims the sacred as its domain.  But we see that religion too often divides us even further: from other people whose religions differ, from nature, and even from God.  Dualist religion often seems to stand <em>between</em> us and reality.  It separates, rather than unites.</p>
<h2>A third alternative</h2>
<p>If we abandoned religion, then what?  The main alternative has been the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'materialism', 'gloss2')" title="“Materialism” has two meanings in this book, which are only distantly related. Mainly, I use it to refer to the stance according to which only self-aggrandizing, mundane purposes (such as money, sex, power, and fame) count as truly meaningful.  It also refers to the metaphysical belief that only things made from physical matter exist. [Click for details.]">materialist</a> consumer culture.  But that denies any meaning beyond the superficial, ephemeral, and selfish.</p>
<p>Religion and consumerism have been pushing each other <a href="https://approachingaro.org/consumerism-fundamentalism-new-age-and-buddhism">into increasingly extreme positions↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Religions world-wide have become increasingly fundamentalist; narrow, aggressive, and intolerant.  They also insist on beliefs, rituals, and moral codes that seem increasingly absurd.</p>
<p>Many religious people would like to drop most specifics of their traditions.  They cling to these details, no matter how out of step with reality, because traditional religion seems the only way to preserve meaning and value in the face of attack from consumerist meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Consumerism, meanwhile, heads ever further into <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilistic</a> triviality.  Denying the connections between us, it encourages selfish greed.  Denying the connections between humans and nature, it produces environmental disasters.  Denying spiritual meaning altogether, it reduces the world to a game in which he who dies with the most toys, wins.</p>
<p>Monism offers a hopeful third alternative.  It liberates one from the wrong-headed specifics of religion.  On the other hand, it can point out what’s important in life, versus the stuff that doesn’t matter.  It preserves meaning and a role for the sacred.  It affirms the connectedness of all things, our joyful responsibility to care for all beings, and the possibility of experiencing unity with the universe.</p>
<h2>System-free: after the New Age</h2>
<p>Monist principles are <a href="#extra27">shared with the New Age movement</a>, and SBNR is often confused with the New Age.  However, most SBNRs reject the New Age.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_s9iyfzw" id="extra29_footnoteref4_s9iyfzw" title="This is a personal observation; again I don’t have any statistics.">4</a>  What is the difference?  And why are 20-somethings SBNR where their parents’ generation might have been New Agers?</p>
<p>The problem with the New Age is that it is not a simple, basic orientation toward meaningness.  Instead, it is a big collection of specific belief systems.  They share the fundamental monist view, but each has its own complex details.</p>
<p><a href="#extra27_problem">The problem with the New Age</a> is that most of its specifics are pretty silly.  Do you really believe that crystal healing comes from ancient astronauts who taught psychic skills to the peaceful pyramid-builders of Atlantis?  Anyway, who cares?</p>
<p>People try to believe that kind of stuff because, until recently, it was the only way to access monism.  The New Age was pretty much the only game in town, if you rejected both religion and materialism.  New Agers were the only ones talking about wholeness and connectedness and consciousness.</p>
<p>Often SBNRs are said to reject “organized religion.”  Although this is roughly true, I think it misses the key point.</p>
<p>I don’t think SBNRs are against <em>organizations</em> as such.  What they reject is the whole category of <em>systems</em>.  By “systems,” I mean ideologies that claim to have a complete set of answers about <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss4')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a>, or some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dimensions', 'gloss5')" title="Meaningness has various “dimensions”: purpose, personal value, ethics, sacredness, and so forth. [Click for details.]">dimensions</a> of meaningness.  Religious organizations are basically corporations that try to sell you spiritual systems.</p>
<p>The American Baby Boom generation grew up within systems of traditional religion—Christianity, mostly.  Though many rejected the specifics of Christianity (and in fact all religions), <em>systems</em> make sense to Boomers.  The New Age systems are comfortable as alternatives.</p>
<p>But later generations have grown up in <a href="https://approachingaro.org/is-buddhism-just-for-baby-boomers">a “post-ism-ist” world↗︎︎</a>.  The time for big complicated ideologies that try to tell you everything about what to believe and do <a href="https://approachingaro.org/twilight-of-the-isms">has passed↗︎︎</a>.  <em>No</em> system like that can be credible anymore.  Younger people don’t want or expect to find a complete set of answers in one place.</p>
<p>Monism is a fundamental <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'stance', 'gloss6')" title="A stance is a basic attitude toward meaningness, or toward a dimension of meaningness. Most stances wrongly fixate meaningness, or deny the existence or nebulosity of a dimension of meaningness.  Typically stances come in pairs, which form false dichotomies.  The simplest examples are eternalism and nihilism. [Click for details.]">stance</a> toward meaningness, not a system.  It is simple and basic.  It doesn’t require you to believe or do anything specific.  (It isn’t really an “ism,” despite the word.)</p>
<p>Because the sacred is within ourselves, and is visible in nature, you don’t need a system to find it.  You only need to recognize what is obviously there.</p>
<h2>Why the new spirituality matters</h2>
<p>Many religious leaders dismiss SBNR as lightweight, faddish, cotton-candy spirituality.  They expect young people will grow out of it.  I think they are wrong on both counts.</p>
<p>Monism is a serious alternative to traditional, dualist religion.  No longer weighted down with the dogmas and rituals of silly New Age systems, it appears to be growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Wishy-washy moderate religion seems to have no spiritual inspiration, and people are leaving it in droves.  Most people understand that neither fundamentalism nor materialism can be the right answer.  Monism is newly attractive as an alternative.  Apparently, it appeals to a <em>majority</em> of people growing up now—and that makes sense.</p>
<p>If I were a religious leader, I would be panicking and scrambling for a response.  Luckily, I am not a religious leader…</p>
<h2>I am not a monist. A fourth alternative</h2>
<p>…but I am concerned nonetheless.</p>
<p>I am spiritual, but not religious.</p>
<p>However, I am not a monist.</p>
<p>My experience is that monists suffer frequent spiritual disappointment and unnecessary suffering.  I think this is inevitable: monism cannot deliver on some core promises.</p>
<p>Fortunately, monism is not the only way to be spiritual while avoiding religion and materialism.  There is another, <em>fourth</em> alternative: not monism, not dualist religion, and not materialism.</p>
<p>This alternative includes what is right in monism, while avoiding its errors.  Like the new monism, it is not a system.  Unlike monism, it may deliver on its promises.</p>
<p>This site is devoted to explaining that fourth alternative.</p>

<p class="intro_para">To prevent civilizational collapse, a bridge may be necessary—specifically for geeks—between systematic rationality and fluid, meta-rational understanding. (Not to be alarmist or anything.)</p>
<p class="intro_para">This is an obscure and superficially implausible claim. Here’s why I think the bridge may be needed—and a sketch of how to start building it.</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_stages">Stages and bridges</h2>
<p>My conceptual framework draws on Robert Kegan’s model of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674272315/?tag=meaningness-20">adult cognitive, affective, and social development↗︎︎</a>. (I recently posted <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">a summary↗︎︎</a> elsewhere. This metablog post won’t make sense unless you understand Kegan’s model, so read that post first, if you haven’t already!)</p>
<p>Kegan describes three stages of adult development (numbered 3, 4, and 5). We could call them <dfn>pre-rational</dfn>, <dfn>rational</dfn>, and <dfn>meta-rational</dfn>. These stages are distinctive, internally consistent, relatively-well-functioning modes for organizing one’s thinking, one’s self, and one’s relationships. They might be described as “islands of psychological stability.” To progress from one island to the next, you must cross a heaving sea of psychological confusion, in which the previous mode no longer seems functional, but you cannot yet operate in the next mode reliably. These stage transitions are emotionally and cognitively difficult, and typically take several years, during which one may think, feel, and act inconsistently.</p>
<p id="extra29_3-to-4">Ideally, a society and culture provides “bridges” of support from one stage to the next. To some extent, ours does. However, Kegan pointed out that we have allowed the bridge from stage 3 to 4 to fall into disrepair. We are not adequately teaching young adults how to be rational, <a href="#chap151">systematic</a>, or modern. This is the central theme of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674445880/?tag=meaningness-20">In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life↗︎︎</a>. </p>
<p>This problem seems to have only gotten worse in the two decades since he wrote that. That is what makes me fear civilizational collapse. Keeping modern institutions operating requires cognitively modern, rational operators. We may be destroying the conditions necessary to produce them. I’ll explain this in more detail later.</p>
<p>Our society and culture do <em>even less</em> to support the transition from stage 4 to 5. This transition, between the rational and meta-rational stages, is particularly difficult; and no bridge has yet been built. This is an unrecognized lack—and so, an opportunity to contribute. It has, perhaps, never been seriously attempted, so it may be unexpectedly easy: “low-hanging fruit” that has not yet been plucked. </p>
<p id="extra29_gap">Between stages 4 and 5, there is a gap, a stretch of open ocean. One recognizes the limitations of rationality, but can’t yet work effectively in the meta-rational mode. Many people get stuck treading water here, trying to stay afloat, often not even able to see the dry land of meta-rationality on the horizon. With rationality seeming the only basis for meaning, they fall into <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilistic', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilistic</a> depression. This is sometimes informally called “stage 4.5,” although it is not a “stage” in the same sense as the others. It is not a workable mode of organization. However, its dysfunction is stabilized by spurious logic of nihilism. Some stuck there may be barely capable of everyday functioning. Others manage better, by recognizing the limits of rationality while continuing to use it effectively in practice.</p>
<p>The stages of individual development are manifest also in forms of social organization. Pre-rational psychology is typical of pre-modern societies—what I’ve described elsewhere as the “<a href="#chap150">choiceless</a>” or “communal” mode. Rationality is characteristic of <a href="#chap151">systematic, modern</a> societies. Postmodernity corresponds to the 4.5 breakdown.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_sabotage">Postmodernism sabotages the bridge to rationality</h2>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the best postmodern/poststructural thinkers presented meta-rational views, based on their thorough understanding of systematic rationality.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_qyd855l" id="extra29_footnoteref1_qyd855l" title="Michel Foucault was, in my opinion, the foremost among them. Unfortunately, his premature death prevented what might have become a complete meta-rational presentation. His last work—the multi-volume, unfinished History of Sexuality—is the best. It’s only incidentally about sexuality; it’s about self and society, knowledge and power, language and experience.">1</a> This first generation of postmodern teachers had a complete “classical education” in the humanities; they mastered the Western intellectual tradition before coming to understand its limitations.</p>
<p>Deconstructive postmodernism, their critique of stage 4 modernism/systematicity/rationality, is the basis of the contemporary university humanities curriculum. This is a disaster. The critique is largely <em>correct</em>; but, as Kegan observed, to teach it to young adults is harmful.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_bri21ki" id="extra29_footnoteref2_bri21ki" title="This is in the final chapter of his In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life, “On being good company for the wrong journey.” The “wrong” journey is that from stage 4 to 5, which he thought almost no university student was ready for.">2</a> Few university students have consolidated rationality. Essentially none are ready to move beyond it. Pointing out its defects makes their developmental task more difficult.</p>
<p>You cannot understand what is wrong with rationalism until you are capable of being rational. You cannot go beyond rationality until after you can use it reliably. You cannot become meta to systems you do not appreciate and do not understand how to deploy. You cannot move from stage 3 to stage 5 without passing through stage 4.</p>
<p>In fact, even most teachers of postmodern theory don’t understand it. Unfortunately, the postmodern pioneers chose to write in obfuscatory riddles. Their insights were difficult enough to understand without that. Few followers could extract the insights. Most teachers are second-generation professors who didn’t understand pomo when it was new, and third-generation ones who were mainly taught dumbed-down second-generation “pseudo-pomo.”</p>
<p>They were never taught to think, and can’t. What they learned was to imitate the founders’ appalling rhetorical style. They even learned to <em>not</em> think—because thinking would lead to questioning the nonsense, which would get you ejected from pomodom. Consequently, most contemporary pomo writing is—as everyone admits—incoherent blather, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. That’s “pseudo-pomo.”</p>
<p>At this point, many humanities professors cannot take even a rational, stage 4 stance; they were not taught to think. Lacking that, they cannot critique rationalism accurately. They could not possibly transmit stage 5 meta-rationality to their students now.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_destroy">“All systems must be destroyed”</h2>
<p>Still worse, pseudo-pomo misunderstands the postmodern critique simply as “all systems are wicked, false ideologies invented by the powerful as means of oppression, and must be destroyed.”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_b2fj472" id="extra29_footnoteref3_b2fj472" title="Kegan pointed out that although campus identity politics is usually presented in pseudo-pomo terms, it could also function as an intuitive attempt to move toward stage 4 from stage 3. The structure of the identity-political ideology is itself a system, which may be a helpful support for some students in forming a coherent, systematic self—an identity. That was in his 1994 In Over Our Heads (pp. 337–338, 342–344, 347). Unfortunately, I suspect that using identity politics as a bridge to stage 4 was more feasible in the early ’90s, at the height of the subcultural mode, than it is now in the atomized mode. Identity politics then retained considerable conceptual coherence from its Marxist roots; but it has become increasingly incoherent. Identity gave way to intersectionalism—in a way consistent with the development from the subcultural to the atomized mode—and that is probably still less capable of leading anyone beyond stage 3.">3</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, “critical theory” has so far failed to produce a broad, positive, clear and practical meta-rational vision. With nothing beyond the discredited stage 4 to look forward to, it is mostly no longer possible for humanities majors to <a href="#chap151_self">develop a rational, systematic self</a>. Nor can they participate effectively in a rational, systematic culture and society. At best, if they do somehow make it to stage 4, deconstructive postmodernism can only push them on into the ultra-relativist nihilism of 4.5. In that abyss, you realize rationality is not the answer, but can see no alternative. There is essentially no support available for the further transition to stage 5.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_64ehs5x" id="extra29_footnoteref4_64ehs5x" title="See, however, Kegan’s discussion of destructive antimodernism (4.5) vs. reconstructive postmodernism (stage 5), in In Over Our Heads, pp. 324–334. This is about as clear a statement of the way forward, within the critical theory framework, as has been written to date, to my knowledge.">4</a></p>
<p>This scares me. Up until the 1980s, a university humanities department did teach you how to think—and it was the standard education for the ruling class. Since then, it has taught you <em>not</em> to think. What happens as people trained in postmodern anti-thought move increasingly into positions of power? Without an appreciation for administrative and technical rationality—much less the ability to deploy them personally—how can they lead governments, corporations, universities, churches, or NGOs?</p>
<p>Recently, major institutions seem increasingly willing to abandon systemic logic: rationality, rule of law, and procedural justice. Such systems <a href="#chap153">lost credibility</a> decades ago, and are under increasing cultural/political attack from the pomo-educated. But <em>for now</em> they are critical to maintaining civilization. Someone has to keep the machinery running. Until we can build a <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid', 'gloss1')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance. It incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism, recognizing that meaningness is always both patterned and nebulous.

[Click for details.]">fluid</a>, meta-rational stage 5 society, destroying stage 4 institutions means everyone will die. (Not to be alarmist or anything.)</p>
<p>Building a bridge to stage 5 may be critical to keeping the bridge to stage 4 open. Because the postmodern critique is <em>correct</em>, it’s intellectually indefensible to insist on rationality as <em>The Way and The Truth and The Light</em>. To make stage 4 palatable, it has to be clear that it is not the final destination. Confirming the accuracy of the critique opens the possibility of a third alternative to the stage 3 and 4 worldviews. Saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>“You are right, systems are <em>not</em> ultimately workable as the basis for society and culture” and</li>
<li>“You are right, systems <em>do</em> always get appropriated by the powerful as means of oppression”</li>
</ul>
<p>makes credible:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Psychologically, understanding rational systems is a stage you need to go through to get beyond them” and</li>
<li>“However imperfect, systems are the main way we currently know how to deliver the material and social prerequisites for life, so we need to keep them running for now.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extra29_woo">Misperception of woo blocks the bridge beyond rationality</h2>
<p>STEM<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_x4djojt" id="extra29_footnoteref5_x4djojt" title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.">5</a> education teaches the value of technical systems, including formal rationality. STEM education ignores postmodernism, so the bridge to stage 4 is still intact there. Thus, stage 5 meta-rationality is now probably more accessible for STEM folks than other people. I think it is important to present stage 5 in language STEM folks can understand and will find attractive.</p>
<p>For people in stage 4, anything that is not rational may sound like simple irrationality, or magical thinking, and so they are likely to reject it. As a further difficulty, stage 5 has some specific commonalities with stage 3 (pre-rationality), making it harder to distinguish. <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Dualism', 'gloss2')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual.

However, from a rationalist point of view, meta-rationalism’s rejection of black-and-white thinking just looks like the blooming buzzing confusion of stage 3 monism, which rationalism is right to reject.</p>
<p>For someone in stage 4, relativizing the ultimate value of rationality seems certain to slide into <a href="#extra1">Romanticism</a> (prioritizing emotions and subjective experience over objective understanding) and woo (supernaturalism, pseudoscience, and wishful thinking). Since nearly all talk about limits to rationality <em>is</em> motivated by stage 3 Romanticism and woo, this is an inevitable misapprehension. However, that is <em>not</em> the stage 5 agenda. This must be made extremely clear.</p>
<p><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">My summary↗︎︎</a> of Kegan’s theory included a point that merited only a footnote there, but which I want to emphasize here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stages 3 and 5 both tolerate contradictions, but of different types and in different ways.</p>
<p>Stage 3 does not feel a need for rational justifications, and mostly doesn’t have the capacity to use them; so it mostly doesn’t even notice logical contradictions, and isn’t bothered by them when it does. However, stage 3 can be highly intolerant of contradictory value judgments, because they threaten community harmony.</p>
<p>Stage 4 finds contradictions within its system a fundamental problem, and tries to eliminate them one way or another. Eventually, if contradictions cannot be eliminated from the system, it must be replaced. Stage 4 wants to find the right system, and if two contradict, that shows one is wrong.</p>
<p>Stage 5 recognizes the value of sorting out contradictions within a system, and retains stage 4’s ability to do so. However, it doesn’t expect any system to work perfectly, so it tolerates internal contradictions if they appear relatively unproblematic. Stage 5 entertains multiple systems, and is comfortable with contradictions between them, because systems are not absolute truths, only ways-of-seeing that are useful in different circumstances. Stage 5 is uniquely comfortable with value conflicts, since (unlike both 3 and 4) it does not take any value as ultimate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say “People in stage 3 tend to misunderstand stage 4 as being stage 2” and hint at the possibility for a similar error at stage 4: “3 and 5 both tolerate contradictions” (I myself got hung up on this superficial similarity for multiple years). I think that’s not just a coincidence but a reason for why we can make a reliable distinction between these stages in the first place. If you view cognitive development as a river then sections where progress lies in a direction that looks backwards create a sort of reservoir. Basically there progress is counter intuitive so people slow down a lot and pile up. These then can more easily recognized as separate stages compared to a continuously flowing river.</p>

<p>For stage 4, stage 5’s tolerance of contradiction is indistinguishable from stage 3’s; both appear simply irrational.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_a3ga5cy" id="extra29_footnoteref6_a3ga5cy" title="This is structurally identical to Ken Wilber’s idea of the pre-rational/trans-rational fallacy, which also draws on adult developmental psychology. I am skeptical of his “trans-rational,” however; it seems to be mostly Romantic monism, which I think is actually anti-rational (and wrong and harmful).">6</a></p>
<p>Lacking a clear presentation of stage 5, and particularly a clear explanation of how it differs from stage 3, it is inaccessible from stage 4 directly. At best, one can only reach it from 4.5, the gap of nihilistic despair. This generally provokes <a href="#chap84">anxiety, rage, and depression</a>, and is not a good place to get stuck.</p>
<p>And, little or no support is available for the 4.5 to 5 transition. Mostly you can only get to stage 5 through a rare combination of luck, intelligence, and endurance.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_postrationalism">The nihilistic gap, STEM depression, and postrationalism</h2>
<p>Many of the people I care about most, and find most interesting, are STEM-educated refugees from <a href="#chap63">ideological rationalism</a>. They’ve mastered rationality, they’ve seen through it—and many now are stuck. Systems cannot provide them with meaning; but neither, it seems can anything else. Many fall into crippling nihilistic depression—a characteristic of stage 4.5. This is awful.</p>
<p>4.5 is <em>necessary</em> en route to stage 5, but maybe it doesn’t need to be so horrible. One needs to become disillusioned and disappointed with rationalism, and then angry at it, and perhaps temporarily reject it altogether (in theory at least). Moving beyond any of the developmental stages involves a profound sense of loss: of one’s previously comfortable mode of making meaning. One’s meaning-making mode is always experienced as “the self,” and the new mode seems frighteningly alien—even though it is more powerful once mastered. The 4-to–5 transition is particularly difficult, as it appears no new meaning is possible even <em>in principle</em>, which implies you are nothing, and have no value.</p>
<p>However, if you understand that meaning re-emerges at stage 5—or can accept this, based on plausible testimony—then you need not descend into despair.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been an exodus from the rationalist movement, and some exiles have loosely grouped under the banner of “postrationalism.” (For an informal review, see <a href="https://yearlycider.wordpress.com/2014/09/19/postrationality-table-of-contents/">Darcey Riley’s 2014 post↗︎︎</a> and the reader comments on it. More recent contributions are from <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/11/05/ritual-epistemology/">Sarah Perry↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://thefutureprimaeval.net/postrationalism/">Warg Franklin↗︎︎</a>.) Postrationalism is an early work-in-progress, whose meaning is as yet unclear, but seems to have much in common with Kegan’s stage 5, and with the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss6')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a> as I describe it in <cite>Meaningness</cite>.</p>
<p>(I’m a little wary of the <em>term</em> “postrational,” because it might be misunderstood as a rejection of rationality, in favor of something irrational. That describes stage 3 Romanticism. Kegan’s stage 5, the complete stance, and—so far as I understand it—postrationalism do not abandon rationality. They deploy rationality as a miscellaneous collection of oft-useful tools, rather than The Single Correct Way To Do Everything. I’m using “meta-rational”—just in this post, so far—as an experimental alternative, meant to suggest that. However, the problem with “meta-rational” is that it may be misunderstood as “applying systematic rationality to itself.” That is not stage 5; it’s just an extra-fancy version of stage 4. Elsewhere I am using the word “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid', 'gloss1')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance. It incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism, recognizing that meaningness is always both patterned and nebulous. Likewise, the fluid mode acknowledges structures of meaning without attempting rigid foundations. Its values are collaboration, creativity, improvisation, intimacy, disposability, aesthetics, and spiritual depth through community participation.

<p>(This is a good time to remember that adult developmental theory is a conceptual model, not Eternal Truth. Like all models, it highlights and partially explains some phenomena, and marginalizes and distorts others. I am using it here because it provides a useful vocabulary for discussing some <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'patterns', 'gloss8')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">patterns</a> I want to point out.)</p>
<p>Twenty-some years ago, Kegan said that the bridge into stage 4 was through participation in a systematic institution: either employment or university education.</p>
<p>Employers such as large corporations and the military induct young adults into bureaucratic rationality. This bridge is still open. However, it seems increasingly under cultural-political attack. Further, it has never led beyond stage 4. Stage 5 institutions are rare, transient, and perhaps entirely hypothetical.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_zwot43k" id="extra29_footnoteref7_zwot43k" title="Kegan developed a theory of stage 5 institutions with management theorist Bill Torbert; I may write about that at some point.">7</a></p>
<p>“Pseudo-pomo” now stands in the way of a systematic humanities education. It is probably still possible to reach stage 4 in some English departments, but you’d have to be smart, lucky, dedicated, and discreet—so I’ve made that a dotted box in the diagram. If you do reach it, the genuine pomo critique is still available; I’ve drawn it with a solid line. However, the critique leads only to ultra-relativistic nihilism. The logical next step, a positive non-<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss9')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalist</a> stage 5 cultural and social vision, does not yet exist. (I do plan to try to sketch one in <cite><a href="#chap147">Meaningness and Time</a></cite>—but that’s not what <em>this</em> post is about.)</p>
<p>Formal rationality is central in STEM education, so it’s now the best route to stage 4. STEM departments do not explicitly go beyond that. However, at least some professors understand the limitations of formal methods and the inherent nebulosity of their subject matter, and may teach that informally. They may also teach some stage 5 cognitive skills informally, implicitly, or by example.</p>
<p>Some STEM people figure out the limits of rationalist ideology on their own. Lacking any intellectual or social framework for that, the discovery often leads to nihilistic despair and social isolation. This is common enough that I’ve given that box a solid border. “Postrationalism” is, perhaps, the dawning of a conceptual structure and social support network for moving beyond it.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_bridge">A bridge to stage 5 for STEM people</h2>
<p>So, I really want to help. I care particularly for the STEM-educated who are lost in the nihilist abyss.</p>
<p>But also, STEM people are the most likely to have made it beyond stage 4, and therefore the most likely to be able to reach stage 5. With stage 4 discredited, getting a critical mass of people to stage 5 may be the only way to preserve civilization from systemic collapse. That could be brought on by broad cultural, social, and psychological reversion to stage 3 tribalism. (Not to be alarmist or anything.)</p>
<p>Stage 5 may contain the answers to current pressing social and cultural problems (as I’ll eventually argue in <cite><a href="#chap147">Meaningness and Time</a></cite>). But perhaps even more critically, building the bridge from 4 to 5 may be the only way to keep the bridge from 3 to 4 open. (And to repair the bridge to rationality for non-STEM people.)</p>
<p>Stage transitions usually cannot be accomplished solo. Intellectual understanding is not enough. A bridge needs a culture and community that help in three ways. They should <dfn>challenge</dfn> current-stage behavior to push you toward the next; they should <dfn>support</dfn> you during the transition, to minimize negative consequences when you are halfway through and can’t quite make the next stage work; they should <dfn>confirm</dfn> (praise and reward) next-stage behavior to the extent you can do it. Systematic institutions, ideally, provide these for new members, transitioning from stage 3 to 4.</p>
<p>Cultural and community context for the 4-to–5 transition has, thus far, been rare. The meta-rational mode is not broadly recognized. Context for reaching it has been created only rarely, idiosyncratically, by exceptional individual mentors, plus their circle of students. I’m probably not in a position to do that currently. I can probably best contribute through mere <dfn>explanation</dfn>. Alas, that is radically inadequate. Maybe it is better than nothing, though.</p>
<p>Each developmental stage can be explained in terms of any aspect of human being. Kegan discusses the 4-to–5 transition in terms of ethics, marriage relationships, and management style. These are not areas that STEM folks are typically particularly interested in. It may be more helpful to explain in terms of cognitive, or epistemological, approaches. Cognition and epistemology are central in Kegan’s model overall, but he’s vague on how they change in the 4-to–5 transition.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is one place I can help.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_mepx6mr" id="extra29_footnoteref8_mepx6mr" title="With the caveat that, unlike Kegan, I’m not an empirical psychologist, so anything novel I say can only be guessing.">8</a> Challenge, here, entails explaining the limitations of rationality; support means showing how meta-rationality works, and how to make the transition emotionally feasible; confirmation is pointing out the power of meta-rationality. <cite>Meaningness</cite>, <a href="/#contents">the book</a>, is supposed to do all three of these, eventually.

<p><a href="#chap63">This book section</a> explains how rationality fails when you try to make it do too much. It’s quite incomplete, and there isn’t even a good overview yet. I’ve also addressed the issue, obliquely, in <a href="#extra8">several</a> <a href="#extra9">metablog</a> <a href="#extra22">posts</a>; and it will also appear in other parts of the book, for example <a href="#chap154">this page</a>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not altogether enthusiastic about writing these bits. The issues have actually been understood pretty well for most of a century. So I’m impatient. I’m like “come <em>on</em>, you can’t <em>really</em> believe anything that dumb, can you!”, which is not a helpful approach.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_g57hbfs" id="extra29_footnoteref9_g57hbfs" title="“Pop Bayesianism: cruder than I thought?” particularly suffered from this problem. I followed up, eventually, with “Probability theory does not extend logic,” which is very patient and properly pedagogical. (Until the second appendix, anyway.) It was a drag to write, and I kept promising it for years before finally finishing. When I did, the people who already understood the issues nodded their heads and said “yes, of course,” and the people who were committed to Bayesian rationalism ignored it.">9</a> Unfortunately, no one else has taken the time to explain the problems clearly and carefully in straightforward language, so far as I know. The discussion is scattered across a dozen disciplines, written in the distinctive academic codes of each. Summarizing this will—or would—be a public service; but not as much fun as I would like.</p>
<p>Anyway, one way or another, many people do figure this out, but get stuck at stage 4.5, so maybe it’s not as important to challenge rationality (from a stage 5 perspective) as to help build the 4.5-to–5 bridge.</p>
<p>As support for that route, I plan to explain in more detail why <a href="#chap82">nihilism is wrong</a>, and to offer antidotes to <a href="#chap84">its emotional pitfalls</a>. Some of this I have drafted in detail, and I’d like to complete those parts soon. (In terms of priorities, I have been torn between working on that and on “<a href="#chap148">The history of meaningness</a>,” which I hope is relevant to some current political dilemmas.)</p>
<p>Cognitive support, and confirmation, mean showing clearly that meta-rational cognition is possible and valuable. “<a href="#extra9">How to Think Real Good</a>” may be a start, although this was not how I thought of its purpose when I wrote it. There’s vastly more to say on this subject.</p>
<p>Even if all that were completed, it would fall far short of building a bridge—because that requires a social and cultural context. Can such a thing exist? I am confident it can. It will take collaborative construction by many contributors, though.</p>

<p class="intro_para">
The contents of the six boxes on the left all have something in common. The six on right also all have something in common, which is the opposite of the ones on the left. What is it?
</p>
<p>This is called a <dfn>Bongard problem</dfn>. I will suggest that Bongard problems are a particularly simple example of <dfn>meta-systematic cognition</dfn>, or “meta-rationality.” This post might be the first lesson in a course that trains you in meta-rational thinking.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The problem above is pretty easy. Here is a somewhat more difficult example:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bongard problem #4 " height="330" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bp004.gif" width="516"/>
</figure>
<p>(Ignore the distracting <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/skeuomorphism">skeuomorphic↗︎︎</a> ring-binder graphic in the middle; it’s not part of the problem. What makes the six boxes on the left different from the six on the right?)</p>
<p>Another problem of medium difficulty:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bongard problem #38 " height="330" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bp038.gif" width="516"/>
</figure>
<p>Bongard problems work inside-out from most puzzles. In a typical puzzle format, you are given a system of rules, and a specific case, and you have to figure out how to apply the rules to that case. For example, the Sudoku rules: the goal is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. In a specific Sudoku puzzle, some of the squares in the grid are already filled in, and you have to fill in the rest while obeying the rules.</p>
<p>In a Bongard problem, you have to figure out <em>what the rule is</em>. You are given twelve specific images, and the result of applying the rule to each. (The rule assigns an image to either the left or right group.) Once you have discovered the rule, applying it to new images would be trivial.</p>
<p>The rule for the first problem, at the top of this page, is “figures with straight line segments on the left, ones with smooth curves on the right.” The second is “convex vs. concave.” And the third is “triangle bigger than circle, vs. circle bigger than triangle.” I found the third a bit more complicated, because I got distracted by the positioning of the two figures in space, and was especially confused by the containment relationships. But all that turns out to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>What makes Bongard problems interesting, and in some cases very difficult, is that there is no explicit limitation to what sorts of rules there may be. However, in a well-formed Bongard problem, there should only be one reasonable rule. Once you see it, there is an “aha!” moment, with an enjoyable jolt of understanding.</p>
<p>Here’s a harder one:</p>

<h2 id="extra29_how">How you solve Bongard problems</h2>
<p>To solve a Sudoku puzzle, you work within a system of rules. This is the essence of systematic thinking, or formal rationality.</p>
<p>To solve a Bongard problem, you <em>discover</em> a rule—a very simple system. This makes for a “minimal,” “toy,” or “petri dish” version of <dfn>meta-systematicity</dfn>. Meta-systematic cognition evaluates, chooses, combines, modifies, discovers, or creates systems—rather than working within one.</p>
<p>My earlier post “<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>” mostly describes ways of thinking meta-systematically, in science and engineering domains—although I wasn’t conscious of that when I wrote it! Much of it is about <dfn>problem formulation</dfn>. As I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding a good formulation for a problem is often most of the work of solving it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bongard problems take this principle to an extreme. Each problem is simply to figure out what the problem is!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the heuristics are about how to take an unstructured, vague problem domain and get it to the point where formal methods become applicable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essence of Bongard problem solution is similar: you need to find the formal structure that makes sense of the data. The difference is that Bongard problems are much less vague than real-world ones typically appear on arrival. They are also simpler, of course. Between crispness and simplicity, you can solve a Bongard problem in seconds, minutes, or hours, where STEM ones can take days, weeks, or years.</p>

Choosing a vocabulary, at the right level of description, for describing relevant factors, is key to understanding.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_dbe8g6p" id="extra29_footnoteref4_dbe8g6p" title="I’ve mashed together some phrases from different parts of “How To Think” here, so you won’t find exactly this passage—or some of the other “quotes”—there.">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Hofstadter explains in detail, this is also how you solve Bongard problems. There’s two aspects: levels of description, and relevant factors. As for the first, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A successful problem formulation has to make explicit the distinctions that are used in the problem solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You start by recognizing simple figures, such as triangles and squares. Then you start building up descriptions in terms of properties and relationships. Some of the figures are big, some are small; some point up, some point down. Some are inside others; some touch others; some are right or left of others. At a next level, you inventory properties and relationships of properties and relationships. In some figures, circles only touch triangles that point up; or there are always three little things inside a big thing; or the centers of all the big figures form a line. The difficulty of a Bongard problem depends, in part, on how many levels of description are involved.</p>
<p>Regarding the second aspect I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A successful formulation has to abstract the problem to eliminate irrelevant detail, and make it small enough that it’s easy to solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hofstadter describes this in terms of “filtering and focussing.” Even in Bongard problems, crisp and simple as they are, nearly everything you could say about a diagram is irrelevant. Typically—but not necessarily!—exact positions and angles and sizes don’t matter, for example. They need to get filtered out, while you focus on what matters.</p>
<p>For example, consider this problem:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bongard problem #55 " height="330" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bp055.gif" width="516"/>
</figure>
<p>Initially, you probably see a variety of shapes, each with a tiny blob attached. Presumably, all the shapes on the left are similar in some way, and all the shapes on the right are similar in a different way. So you start looking at properties of the shapes—rounded versus angular, counting numbers of sides, looking at which direction the indentation points. But all this turns out to be irrelevant. The solution depends on an entirely different way of looking at the problem. (Answer in footnote,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_wynwuw2" id="extra29_footnoteref5_wynwuw2" title="On the left, the blob is a bit counterclockwise from the indentation; on the right, it’s clockwise.">5</a> in case you are stuck!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s an obvious difficulty here: if you don’t know the solution to a problem, how do you know whether your vocabulary makes the distinctions it needs? The answer is: you can’t be sure; but there are many heuristics that make finding a good formulation more likely.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_l18g3ls" id="extra29_footnoteref6_l18g3ls" title="Quoted from “How To Think.” Hofstadter and I both suggest that these heuristics are important and numerous, but it is a weakness in both our accounts that we don’t actually give good examples! He says this would be “very hard,” at least when attempting sufficient definiteness to program an AI system (p. 661). I’m somewhat more optimistic, at least about explaining them adequately for human use.">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, though, in a multi-level search process, you need to be able to recognize incremental progress. In Bongard problems, you are searching for an adequate description vocabulary. With the more difficult problems, you find that particular descriptive terms give partial insight, and then you build on them.</p>
<p>But, your assessment of whether you have made partial progress is always uncertain, until you have the final solution. Hofstadter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way a picture is represented is always tentative. Upon the drop of a hat, a high-level description can be restructured, using all the devices of the later stages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens when you get stuck? I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vocabulary selection requires careful, non-formal <em>observation</em> of the real world. If a problem seems too hard, the formulation is probably wrong. Go back to reality, and <em>look</em> at what is going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the experience of Bongard solving: repeatedly <em>looking</em> at the diagrams—sometimes to deliberately check a tentative formulation; but sometimes in a less directed way, dropping back to a lower level of description, hoping that a pattern will pop out at you.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_4.1">Stage 4.1</h2>
<p>Rationality, a form of systematic thought, is “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">stage 4↗︎︎</a>” of human cognitive development. Meta-rationality, or meta-systematicity, is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">stage 5↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>In “<a href="#extra12">A bridge to meta-rationality vs. civilizational collapse</a>,” I suggested that it may be <a href="#extra14">critical to human survival</a> for more STEM-educated people to learn meta-rationality. (Not to be alarmist or anything.) That will require a “bridge” or “path.” I’ve begun working toward a curriculum for teaching meta-rationality.</p>
<p>As a “sandbox,” or “finger-painting version” of meta-rationality, Bongard problems may be an ideal first lesson. As an “abuse of notation,” we could imagine “stages” 4.1, 4.2, and so on, up to 4.9 and 5.0. The first module of the curriculum, 4.1, would present the various types of meta-systematic cognition in a STEM-friendly format. Maybe we can develop sandboxes for evaluating, choosing, combining, modifying, and creating systems—just as Bongard problems are a sandbox for discovering them.</p>
<p>(Solving large numbers of Bongard problems is not necessary; doing that is probably not particularly effective training in meta-rationality. The point is to understand how solving them <em>is</em> meta-rational, which probably requires working through only a dozen or two.)</p>
<p>The goal here is to make meta-rationality easy and fun. That is important in demonstrating its existence, and its value, <em>before</em> getting to the horrifying <a href="#extra12_gap">stage 4.5</a> realization that systems can never be made to work in their own terms, and <a href="#chap63">rationality’s promises</a> of <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap34">control</a> are <a href="#chap37">all lies</a>. Rationalists resist explanations of meta-rationality, because they sense—and rightly fear—the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a> of 4.5. It can only be possible to lead rationalists beyond stage 4 if they have confidence that stage 5 is real and attractive: neither woo nor nihilistic despair.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_woo">Look Ma, no woo!</h2>
<p>For stage 4 rationalists, it’s <a href="#extra12_woo">easy to mistake</a> stage 5 meta-rationalism for stage 3 <a href="#chap150">pre-rationalism</a>. Stage 3 is long on “woo”: supernatural beliefs, pseudoscience, and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The Bongard problems are a great introduction to meta-rationality for STEM people, because they <em>definitely</em> involve no woo. There appears—at first—to be nothing “mushy” or “metaphysical” involved.</p>
<p>Solving them obviously involves rationality. It <em>feels</em> very similar to solving ordinary puzzles, which are paradigms of systematic cognition. This illustrates the important point that stage 5 does not reject systematicity: it <em>uses</em> it. In fact, at this point, a rationalist might object that solving Bongard problems is clearly <em>just</em> rational, and that there is no meaningful distinction between “meta-rationality” and ordinary rationality. (They might invoke the Church-Turing Thesis.) I’ll come back to that later in the post. But if this is your reaction, I have succeeded in sneakily leading you 0.1 of the way along the path to stage 5.0, without triggering your stage 4.0 <a href="#chap38">eternalist defenses</a>.</p>
<p>Solving Bongard problems does seem to involve “intuition”—leading to flashes of “aha!”. Woomeisters love the word “intuition,” so we should be wary of it. Mostly, “intuition” just means “mental activity we don’t have a good explanation for,” or maybe “mental activity we don’t have conscious access to.” It is a useless concept, because we don’t have good explanation for much if any mental activity, nor conscious access to much of it. By these definitions, nearly everything is “intuition,” so it’s not a meaningful category. Woomeisters’ <em>implication</em> is that, because we don’t have good explanations for “intuition,” <em>therefore</em> it works according to some crackpot theory (which may involve “quantum,” “cosmic,” or “transcendent”), which <em>proves</em> we are all God and can live forever.</p>
<p>In fact, the “intuition” or “insight” involved in solving Bongard problems probably involves no special mental mechanisms.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_81kix4n" id="extra29_footnoteref7_81kix4n" title="See GEB p. 661 on this.">7</a> This is probably true of meta-rational cognition in general. It’s probably <em>also</em> true of rationality versus pre-rationality.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_9tlyydd" id="extra29_footnoteref8_9tlyydd" title="I say “probably” because we don’t actually know how any sort of thinking works.">8</a> Rational thought is not a special type of mental activity. It is a diverse collection of patterns for using your ordinary pre-rational thinking processes to accomplish particular kinds of tasks, by <em>conforming to</em> systems. Likewise, meta-rationality is a diverse collection of patterns of ordinary thinking that accomplish particular kinds of tasks, by <em>manipulating</em> systems from the outside.</p>

</figure>
<p>Bongard problems are sometimes used as a simple model for science. Solving them involves using observations to create hypotheses, checking the hypotheses against empirical data, and refining your hypothesis when data disconfirm it. As a model, it’s valuable in pointing out that science is not just problem solving, it’s also problem formulating.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_spn5ssw" id="extra29_footnoteref9_spn5ssw" title="Science is, perhaps even more importantly, also problem choosing. Even less has been written about problem choosing than about problem formulating. I have good intentions to rectify that at some point.">9</a> Scientific problem formulating is not taught much, probably exactly because it requires going beyond stage 4.</p>
<p>We saw, in the “tiny blobs” problem, that <em>re</em>-formulation is often critical. Hofstadter writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are discoveries on all levels of complexity. The Kuhnian theory that certain rare events called “paradigm shifts” mark the distinction between “normal” science and “conceptual revolutions” does not seem to work, for we can see paradigm shifts happening all throughout the system, all the time. The <em>fluidity of descriptions</em> ensures that paradigm shifts will take place on all scales.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_c7lt151" id="extra29_footnoteref10_c7lt151" title="p. 660; emphasis added.">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t do science well without having some meta-rational skills. In fact, you probably can’t do it <em>at all</em>. This makes the point that meta-rationality is not some special woo thing for Enlightened Masters only. You also probably can’t survive daily life in the modern world without some ability to think rationally. However, both rationality and meta-rationality are skills. You can learn to do them better; and that gives you increasing power in certain domains.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_church-turing">But Church-Turing!</h2>
<p>I intuit that some rationalist readers have had increasingly high-pressure jets of steam coming out of their ears as they read this post, because I seem to be missing the fatal flaw in the whole story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These puzzles can <em>obviously</em> be solved systematically and rationally. From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Church-Turing Thesis↗︎︎</a>, we know there’s nothing special going on! We know humans can’t do anything more than a computer can. If a human can use these supposedly “meta-systematic” types of reasoning, they are just another system. Whatever algorithm people use to solve Bongard problems, it <em>is an algorithm</em>, so it is a rational system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two and a half answers to this.</p>
<p>First, the objection applies equally to rationality versus irrationality. If people are algorithms, and they are often irrational and unsystematic, then algorithms can be either rational or not; systematic or not. In that case, “rationality” and “systematicity” are properties of certain kinds of computation, but are not characteristic of computation in general. So this can’t be a valid objection to characterizing certain non-systematic sorts of computation as “meta-rational” or “meta-systematic.”</p>
<p>Second, the objection turns partly on the ambiguity of the terms “system” and “rationality.” These are necessarily vague, and I am not going to give precise definitions. However, by “system” I mean, roughly, a set of rules that can be printed in a book weighing less than ten kilograms, and which a person can consciously follow.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_52qui62" id="extra29_footnoteref11_52qui62" title="All rationality is systematic, but not all systems are rational. Sharia, traditional Chinese medicine, and waterfall development methodology are all definitely systems, with elaborate rules and expert disputation over geeky details. Plausibly, these systems are not rational, however. A “rational” system is one that is “good” or “effective” according to some criterion. There are various theories of what the right criterion should be. From a meta-rational perspective, there is no best such criterion; different ones have different advantages.">11</a>  If a person is an algorithm, it is probably an incomprehensibly vast one, which could not written concisely. It is probably also an incomprehensibly weird one, which one could not consciously follow accurately. I say “probably” because we don’t know much about how minds work, so we can’t be certain.</p>
<p>What we can be certain is that, because we don’t know how minds work, we can’t treat them as systems <em>now</em>. That is the case even if, when neuroscience progresses sufficiently, they might eventually be described that way. Even if God told us that “a human, reasoning meta-systematically, is just a system,” it would be useless in practice. Since we can’t now write out rules for meta-systematic reasoning in less than ten kilograms, we have to act, for now, <em>as if</em> meta-systematic reasoning is non-systematic.</p>
<p>The half answer is that the Church-Turing Thesis probably has almost nothing to do with thinking. Probably its only implication is that people can’t compute HALTS? or other uncomputable functions; which says nothing about irrationality, rationality, or meta-rationality. (Meta-rationality does <em>not</em> require computing the uncomputable!) This is a half answer because there’s more to say than fits in a blog post. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USF1H70bRl0">A talk by Brian Cantwell Smith↗︎︎</a> is relevant to this, and to other themes of <cite><a href="/#contents">Meaningness</a></cite>, and is excellent.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ai">AI, Bongard, and human-complete problems</h2>
<p>Bongard problems were originally designed as a test domain for artificial intelligence, in the mid-’60s, when AI still looked easy. There has been very limited progress.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_axckq7w" id="extra29_footnoteref12_axckq7w" title="By far the best work is the 2006 Ph.D. thesis of Harry Foundalis, supervised by Hofstadter. Foundalis also maintains the catalog of Bongard problems I linked earlier. Interestingly, he stopped working on AI for several years because he was concerned about its ethical risks.">12</a> Despite many AI researchers finding the problems fascinating, few have tackled them, because on reflection they come to seem extremely difficult. The number of properties and relationships that must be recognized and represented is large, and their possible combinations produce an exponentially increasing number of feasible hypotheses at each successive level of description.</p>
<p>Such progress as we’ve had in AI since 1990 has come almost entirely from brute force. Computers are so fast that combinatorial explosions are less daunting now than during the golden days of the 1970s and ’80s, when most known AI algorithms were invented. Could Bongard problems now be brute-forced, by generating and testing billions of hypotheses, where earlier programs were only able to consider dozens? I don’t know. I’m tempted to try! But I’ll explain reasons to think that can’t work.</p>
<p>A “human-complete” problem is one that is so hard that if a computer could do <em>that</em>, it could do anything a person can do. Any solution to the problem would also have to be a complete solution to emulating human intelligence.</p>
<p>Early on, artificial intelligence researchers concentrated on trying to solve human-complete problems, because they thought AI would be easy, so they might as well just do the whole thing at once, rather than wasting time implementing subsets of human-level intelligence. Once we realized AI is hard, we took the opposite approach: avoid human-complete problems, because we <em>know</em> those are currently infeasible.</p>
<p>The best candidate for a human-complete problem is carrying on an ordinary undirected conversation over a text chat connection.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_mjtsoqb" id="extra29_footnoteref13_mjtsoqb" title="This is often described as the “Turing Test,” although Turing’s original version involved a person trying to pass as the opposite sex. This tells us quite a lot about Turing, but perhaps not so much about artificial intelligence.">13</a> Chatting is likely human-complete because it’s so open-ended. Essentially any topic could come up in a causal conversation, and then you’d have to say something sensible about it. (If you are the sort of person reading this post, you might even want to talk about Bongard problems and how to solve them!)</p>
<p>It seems Bongard problems might also be human-complete—or even “intelligence-complete.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bongard problems have a quality of universality to them. They depend on a sense of simplicity which is not just limited to earthbound human beings. The skill of solving them lies very close to the core of “pure” intelligence.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_lxwoass" id="extra29_footnoteref14_lxwoass" title="GEB, pp. 661-2, lightly paraphrased.">14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason, again, is that almost anything might be relevant. The kinds of concepts and reasoning needed is unbounded. For instance, this problem involves totally different considerations from the ones you’ve seen so far:</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bongard problem #199 " height="330" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bp199.gif" width="516"/>

<p>A program to solve Bongard problems would need, for instance, basic “intuitive” physics knowledge. In fact, we could probably encode <em>any</em> kind of intelligence or knowledge into a Bongard problem.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_rs586bw" id="extra29_footnoteref16_rs586bw" title="Foundalis’ thesis provides various interesting examples. Generally, it’s considered that a proper Bongard problem depends only on “general” knowledge and intelligence; it’s not “fair” to test specifics such as understanding of Medieval musical instruments—although you could indeed build that into a Bongard-style problem, with photographs of lutes, gitterns, citoles, and racketts.">16</a> This makes it plausible that Bongard problems are, indeed, human-complete.</p>
<p>Check <em>this</em> out: a meta-Bongard-problem, about Bongard problems!</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Bongard problem #200 " height="330" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/bp200.gif" width="516"/>
</figure>
<p>Here each of the twelve boxes contains a Bongard-type problem (each with only six examples, rather than the usual twelve). How are the six problems on the left different from the six on the right? (Solution in footnote.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_8sd3lti" id="extra29_footnoteref17_8sd3lti" title="The problems on the left concern individual properties of objects; those on the right concern numbers of objects.">17</a>)</p>
<p>The likely human-completeness of Bongard problems doesn’t mean a program couldn’t, in principle, do as well as people; only that we are currently very far from knowing how to write one.</p>
<p>“Deep learning” is the only interesting advance in AI since 1990. It’s mostly just brute force, but some of the applications have been impressive. I’m seriously interested in understanding its power and limits. (Some of the hype suggests that human-level AI is imminent. I don’t think so.) I’m pretty sure deep learning would get nowhere with Bongard problems. I would be very surprised and impressed and excited if I were wrong!</p>

<p>I hope I’ve persuaded you now that meta-rationality is emotionally safe. I hope you are intrigued: you can see that “meta-rationality” is plausibly a thing, and useful, and you can do it, and you want to learn more about how. Developing that curiosity is the goal of the “4.1” module of the meta-rationality curriculum. In “4.2,” we can look at ways of developing meta-systematic skills.</p>
<p>But now I want to scare you a little. (Probably this isn’t good pedagogy. Probably I should withhold the nasty surprise as long as possible…)</p>
<p>Deviously, I have led you over the edge of a cliff. You have started walking on a cloud, and you haven’t noticed because you haven’t looked down. At 4.5, you will see that there is no ground beneath you, and then will you fall into the abyss of nihilism. You will fall, that is, unless you have learned the skills of cloud-treading!

<p>Eternalism is false. There is no ultimate grounding for meaning. Our knowledge and understanding can only ever be vague, ambiguous, and fluid.

<p>The answer is obvious: triangles versus circles. Except that most of them aren’t. We have to see things that objectively <em>aren’t</em> triangles or circles <em>as</em> triangles and circles.</p>
<p>Hofstadter describes this as the “fluidity of descriptions,” “play,” “slippage,” and “bending.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One has to be able to “bend” concepts, when it is appropriate. Nothing should be absolutely rigid. On the other hand, things shouldn’t be so wishy-washy that nothing has any meaning at all, either.

<p>The answer to the third problem is “four line segments vs. five.”</p>
<p>“But,” you may object, “two of the examples on the right have only three line segments!” And that’s because I led you down a garden path again. The first two problems set you up to think about line segments in wrong ways for the third. What <em>counts</em> as a line segment in the third problem is “a straight bit leading up to a junction or termination.” The first example on the right side has three horizontal “segments,” split at the junctions, plus the two vertical ones; the H-shaped one has four vertical segments, plus one horizontal one.</p>
<p>Here is another problem of the same sort. I spent ten minutes trying, and failing, to solve it. You may find it easier, knowing that the solution is similar to the previous one.</p>

<p>(Solution in footnote.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote20_koi5ucz" id="extra29_footnoteref20_koi5ucz" title="This one is about the number of “groups” of white blobs. A black blob separates groups. On the left there are three groups; on the right, four.">20</a>)</p>
<p>The point of these examples is that what counts as an “object” depends on the context. This was true in the “mushy” problem above, too. One of the “circles” can also be described as a group of triangles. Is it one object, or many? Neither answer is “objectively true”; which one is useful depends on what you are doing.</p>
<p>This is a metaphysical, or ontological, observation. Ontology asks: what kinds of objects are there?</p>
<p>And part of the answer is: objects, and their boundaries, are not objective features of the world. They are necessarily nebulous: cloud-like. Reality does not come divided up into bits; we have to do that. But we can’t do it arbitrarily, and just impose whatever boundaries we like, because reality is also patterned. The individuation of objects, and placement of boundaries, is a collaboration between self and other.</p>
<p>This is much more true of everyday physical reality than of Bongard problems (which are, after all, <em>relatively</em> crisp). I began to explain that in “<a href="#chap95">Boundaries, objects, and connections</a>.” That page asks: is a jam jar one object, or two, or three? It depends on your purposes at the time you look at it. Where, in a mixture, does jam stop and yogurt begin? There is no objective answer. Eventually that page will introduce a large discussion of how this works, and what it implies.</p>
<p>If you think I’m wrong, stupid, or crazy, how about Richard Feynman? Check out his discussion of the vagueness of objects <a href="#extra9_feynman-objects">here</a>.</p>
<p>That inherent vagueness is central to the <cite>Meaningness</cite> explanation of meaning, and to “fluid” or “meta-systematic” cognition. You may be able to begin to see why now!</p>
<p>If you’d like further hints, you can read Alexandre Linhares’ “<a href="http://app.ebape.fgv.br/comum/arq/Linhares2.pdf">A glimpse at the metaphysics of Bongard problems↗︎︎</a>.” Linhares collaborated with, and built on the work of, Hofstadter and Foundalis. He also built on the work of Brian Cantwell Smith, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USF1H70bRl0">whose talk↗︎︎</a> I recommended above. Smith’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262193639/?tag=meaningness-20">On the Origin of Objects↗︎︎</a> develops an account similar to that I’ll explain in <cite>Meaningness</cite>. (Any decade now.)</p>
<p>This also connects closely—and not coincidentally!—with the work on active, task-directed machine vision in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262031817/?tag=meaningness-20">my Ph.D. thesis↗︎︎</a>. It’s a model for <em>how</em> we use visual processing to individuate objects. More about that later, too, I hope!</p>

<p class="intro_para">The politics of meaning are swirling into a new configuration. Since the 1960s, “values issues” have defined stable left and right political coalitions. Most people dutifully lined up with one side or the other, and most political questions were forced to align with a fixed left vs. right opposition.</p>
<p>The 2016 American Presidential campaign, and the UK Brexit vote, have split both the “left” and “right” internally, each into roughly equal halves. A new basic division of political opinion has emerged—in these countries, at least. But what is it? </p>
<p>I suspect the fault line in the new politics reflects the <dfn>communal</dfn> versus <dfn>systematic</dfn> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'modes', 'gloss0')" title="“How meaning fell apart” suggests a series of modes of relating to meaningness. In the choiceless mode, meaningness is taken as given, without question. In the systematic mode, meanings have to be justified. (This is closely connected with eternalism.) As systematic justifications break down, the countercultural, subcultural, and atomized modes are successive attempts to relate to the fragmentation of meaning. Finally, the fluid mode synthesizes the functional aspects of all the previous ones. [Click for details.]">modes</a> of relating to meaning. This realignment offers both fearful risks and hopeful opportunities—because both modes are partly right and partly wrong. Although a communal/systematic split could be catastrophic, it may also point the way to a new mode that heals the fundamental crisis of meaningness that has plagued the West for a hundred years.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_class">A return to the pre-’60s politics of class?</h2>
<p>A common current analysis invokes socio-economic class:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new division pits the working and lower-middle classes against the upper-middle and elite classes. It is driven by resentment of growing economic inequality and of the social contempt of the elites for the lower classes. </li>
<li>Since the 1960s, elites have used trivial culture-war “values issues” to distract the lower classes from the weighty economic policy decisions that are the proper subject of politics.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_5xlfg4o" id="extra29_footnoteref1_5xlfg4o" title="My chapter on the ’60s-’80s countercultural mode will cover the history this soon. I hope.">1</a> Elites—who pretend to be either on the left or right, but are united in pursuit of their class interest—kept their lower-class followers divided from each other with bear-baiting ideological goads. </li>
<li>Finally, now, the lower classes have caught onto the game and are in revolt.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is probably partly accurate—but I suspect not quite right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of more than a hundred socio-economic variables, the <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2016/06/24/brexit-demographic-divide-eu-referendum-results/">best predictor↗︎︎</a> for Remain in the Brexit vote was holding a college degree. Income also correlated with the vote, but less strongly.</li>
<li>College degrees also seem<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_ggs93wx" id="extra29_footnoteref2_ggs93wx" title="The demographics of Trump supporters is itself a contested political issue, so it’s hard to be confident of facts based on casual web searches that lead to mass media reports. Detractors want to prove that Trump supporters are stupid; supporters want to prove that it’s socially acceptable to vote for him even if you are college-educated.">2</a> to predict the Republican primary vote <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/who-are-donald-trumps-supporters-really/471714/">better than income↗︎︎</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>College degrees predict social class better than economic class. This might suggest that “<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism">snooty elite contempt↗︎︎</a>” is a larger factor than income inequality. That seems dubious. </p>
<p>I will suggest a different explanation: that college degrees predict support for <em>systems as such</em>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_incoherence">The politics of incoherence</h2>
<p>Before getting to that alternative analysis, let’s look at another pair of unexpected political quakes. Some readers may be old enough to remember Occupy and the Tea Party. These movements were strikingly similar, although one was on “the far left” and the other on “the far right.” Both were highly upset about <em>something</em>, and wanted immediate change, but—it was much noted at the time—neither could say what they wanted, why they should get it, or how anyone could give it to them.</p>
<p>These movements initiated the <dfn>politics of incoherence</dfn>. Up to this point, it was taken for granted that political statements had to make sense. They might be based on invented “facts,” or use fallacious reasoning; but it was a social convention that they had to at least <em>sound</em> like rational arguments. </p>
<p>Occupy and the Tea Party were exhilarating, because suddenly you could just <em>say what you thought</em>, without any need to justify it. You could simply ignore your opponents’ claims, without any tedious responsibility for working out counter-arguments. </p>
<p>This was based on the accurate recognition that <a href="#chap33_politics">political arguments are pointless</a>. They never convince anyone. Everyone now understands that interest groups will always pay TV pundits to spout statistical factoids and logical-sounding arguments in favor of anything, no matter how wrong. The <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/05/buddhist-ethics-is-advertising/#opinions">moral↗︎︎</a> <a href="#chap33_opinions">duty</a> to <a href="#chap33_regurgitate">regurgitate</a> those no longer seems compelling.</p>
<p>Similarly, many have commented on the incoherence of the 2016 Brexit and American Presidential campaigns. It is not that that one side or the other is wrong. It is that key participants no longer even pretend to make sense. There is no longer a social norm that politics <em>should</em> make sense.</p>
<p>In America, both Trump and Sanders <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/opinion/donald-trump-works-the-internet-better-than-you-do/">practice the politics of incoherence↗︎︎</a>. They are unapologetic about ignoring facts, and <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2016/03/16-real-loser-2016-campaign-policy-reeves">feel no obligation↗︎︎</a> to offer realistic policy proposals. That stuff is ancient history. Politics isn’t about sense, facts, or policy anymore.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_system">“It’s the system!”</h2>
<p>Occupy and the Tea Party couldn’t explain what they wanted, but it’s clear what they were against: “<dfn>The System</dfn>.” They recognized that politics-as-usual will always keep The System in power. The System doesn’t care about “left” and “right.” Those are just entertainment for the masses: two football teams who play the same game by the same rules, indistinguishable apart from the colors on their jerseys.</p>
<p>The American Presidential campaign was “supposed” to be Bush versus Clinton, both boringly loyal agents of The System, neither of whom would have changed anything much. Both parties were unexpectedly split, to an unprecedented extent, by incoherent, anti-System candidates.</p>
<p>There is no “The System,” actually—that’s conspiracy theory stuff. What we have instead are numerous interlocking, sometimes-competing systems: governments, laws, corporations, the media, the professions, churches and religions, schools and universities, hospitals and transportation utilities. </p>
<p>These intricate institutions all run on the <dfn>systematic mode</dfn> of relating to meaning. I have explained that in detail: in historical terms <a href="#chap151">here</a>, and in social and psychological terms <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">here↗︎︎</a>. In summary, the systematic mode demands that society operate according to a <dfn>structure of justification</dfn>, built from chains of reasons. It is “rational” at least in that everything has to make sense, in terms of “this, therefore that.” Ideally, society operates as a well-maintained machine. </p>
<p>The enormous improvements in material conditions over the past few centuries are due mainly to systematicity. That’s the good part. </p>
<p>The bad part is that the systematic mode is profoundly psychologically unnatural. For many people it seems <a href="#chap153_self">dehumanizing, alienating, incomprehensible, senseless, meaningless, and utterly immoral</a>. This has been obvious for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Renegotiating the relationship between individuals and society has been a pressing—but unsolved—problem since at least the First World War. It reached a breaking point in the 1960s and ’70s, when the <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a>, of the left and right, proposed alternative reforms.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_b8apa5w" id="extra29_footnoteref3_b8apa5w" title="A revival of class politics would be a return to the pre–1960s political landscape. Interestingly, an anti-systematic politics would be a return to the 1960s, which pitted the anti-systematic counterculture against the systematic Establishment. The countercultural left became the new systematic establishment in the 1970s—as I will recount Real Soon Now.">3</a> Both were partly accepted, and an uneasy synthesis of the two has been the <em>de facto</em> mainstream social form for half a century. Until now: the new politics suggests that the deal offered to individuals by society is no longer adequate.</p>
<p>Systematicity was always imposed by elites. Few people wanted it, and most would have rejected it if they could. The majority implicitly mistook material progress as something that just happens, not fully recognizing that medicine and jobs and roads and food and the internet depend on vast chains of “because.” Research by Robert Kegan, a psychologist whose work has heavily influenced my thinking on this topic, suggests that <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#empirical">roughly two thirds↗︎︎</a> of Americans are unable to fully cope with the demands of systematic institutions. <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#traditional">They are↗︎︎</a> “developmentally traditional people in a modern world.” </p>
<p>Undergraduate education explains the systematic structures of justification,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_smdnics" id="extra29_footnoteref4_smdnics" title="Unfortunately, as I explained in a recent post, this is decreasingly true, due to obfuscatory postmodernism. This may be one reason for the rise of anti-systematic politics: even many of the college-educated now fail to understand the value of systematicity.">4</a> which is why, I think, the new politics correlates so strongly with lack of a college degree.</p>
<p>The revolt against systematicity—if that is what we are seeing—is <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/23/the-revolt-of-the-public-and-the-crisis-of-democracy/">genuinely democratic↗︎︎</a>. This is good. People who cope poorly with systematicity have, until now, been denied any voice; they had no platform to speak, and in elections were offered only a choice between parties and candidates who all took systematicity for granted. That was anti-democratic and unfair. The internet, particularly social media, now gives them a platform—and the American primary election has given them a candidate.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_alternative">What’s the alternative?</h2>
<p>The natural human alternative is the <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">communal mode↗︎︎</a>: unstructured, egalitarian, empathic, local, tribal, familiar, and comfortable. This mode—I’ve also called it “choiceless”—<a href="#chap150">feels profoundly right</a>. We evolved to live in such societies; they fit our psychology in a way systematic ones cannot. </p>
<p>The problem is, the communal mode cannot sustain life on a planet of billions of people, much less provide the material benefits, entertainment, and understanding we are used to.</p>
<p>The problem is, we <em>currently</em> have no workable alternative to systematicity. This makes anti-systematic politics entirely <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilistic', 'gloss1')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilistic</a>. Occupy, the Tea Party, Leave, Trump, and Sanders endorse communal-mode values—quite rightly—but have no practical vision for how society could better support them. Even many of their supporters freely admit that their votes are simply <em>against</em> the systematic status quo, not <em>for</em> something better. Their attitude is “we want to end politics, because we always lose anyway.” This risks destroying the conditions for civilized life, in a rage that institutions are imperfect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, again, the status quo <em>is</em> not merely imperfect, but—for many—intolerable. Fortunately, the systematic mode’s claim to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">ultimate justification</a> is bogus. This is widely understood by elites, but they see no better alternative, and—cynically—many have merely milked systems as their grounding increasingly disintegrates. Particularly in the past decade, more and more, the developed economies are devoted to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp">rent-seeking↗︎︎</a>: systems that stand in the way of people doing useful things, and charge fees to let us past.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_h4zzmpj" id="extra29_footnoteref5_h4zzmpj" title="Two obvious American examples: banks charge a couple of percent every time someone gives someone else non-physical money; technologically, this cannot cost them more than a small fraction of a percent. The health finance industry takes several percent of GDP, in exchange for preventing people from getting medical care. In the UK, Remain’s argument that Britain was economically better off in than out may have been correct, but it’s also true that the EU creates elaborate artificial barriers to voluntary exchanges, for the benefit of protected economic interests.">5</a> The “mainstream” American Presidential candidates are widely viewed as values-free puppets of rent-seeking economic elites.</p>
<p>The systematic mode can, should, must be superseded—not by the communal mode, but by something that combines benefits of both. I think that is possible; I describe it as the “fluid mode.” (I haven’t given a proper account of this yet. There are beginnings <a href="#chap149">here</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">here↗︎︎</a> and  <a href="#extra12">here</a>.)</p>
<p>A revolt against the systematic mode may force progress toward fluidity—if we escape simple nihilistic destruction.</p>

<p class="intro_para">
The slogan “the personal is political,” originating in 1960s feminism, encapsulates both countercultures’ political agenda. Society had to change to accommodate the self; and political action was the way to reform the social structure.
</p>
<p>Between them, the <a href="#chap157">two countercultures</a> shoved aside existing power dynamics and created <a href="#chap162">reorganized coalitions</a> which have dominated American politics ever since. Though both movements expired long ago, the struggle between them left a <a href="#chap167">culture war</a> that refuses to die.</p>

<p>A previous page, “<a href="#chap159">Renegotiating self and society</a>,” summarized the countercultures’ political program. The <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systematic mode', 'gloss0')" title="The systematic mode attempts to justify all meanings with some explanatory structure. Typically, this system builds on a foundational eternal ordering principle. The systematic mode is eternalistic, claiming to offer absolute certainty, understanding, and control. In the late twentieth century, it became clear that this is impossible, and the systematic mode failed. [Click for details.]">systematic mode</a> had imposed a hard division between self and society, which caused <a href="#chap153_self">alienation, angst, and anomie</a>. The countercultures addressed these problems by blurring the public/private boundary: <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political">the personal is political↗︎︎</a></dfn>.</p>
<p>They sought to replace the artificial, seemingly-arbitrary social and personal requirements of the systematic mode with ones they considered natural. They tried to reorient society away from formal, systematic roles toward natural ones: family, unstructured friendships, and local communities. The <a href="#chap157">monist counterculture</a> thought humanistic, egalitarian norms would be more natural. The dualist counterculture thought godly, hierarchical norms would be more natural.</p>
<p>“Authenticity” meant bringing the private and public selves into alignment. This was the obvious response to the painful gap between them. However, it represents a partial reversion toward the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'choiceless mode', 'gloss1')" title="In the choiceless mode, you are unaware of differences of opinion concerning meaningness.

Systems can be unjust, inhumane, rigid, dysfunctional, or outright inimical to human survival. Unfortunately, we still don’t know how to live without them. The choiceless mode <a href="#chap150">feels right</a> but it can’t feed a world of billions of people. The countercultures mostly recognized this, and did seek only to replace existing systems, not to return to a pre-systematic state.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_9d7g53n" id="extra29_footnoteref1_9d7g53n" title="There were exceptions, particularly in the monist counterculture. Monist movements like anti-capitalism, anti-rationalism, eco-primitivism, the Noble Savage mythos, and the back-to-the-land movement would have destroyed systematicity altogether if actually carried out. The dualist counterculture’s alliance with the big-business Republican right mainly forestalled similar moves, although its fringier anti-rational elements could have been equally catastrophic if they had gained power.">1</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_merging">Merging ethics, politics, religion, and identity</h2>
<p>Both countercultures unified politics and morality: the public and private manifestations of “ought.” Merging them helped collapse the self/society boundary. This led to a massive revision of  American political, class, and religious systems—as we’ll see in <a href="#chap162">the next page</a>.</p>
<p>The countercultures perceived <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie">anomie↗︎︎</a>: a breakdown in morality due to broad recognition that public norms were discordant with private values. Both called for a reform of social norms to bring them closer to ethical norms, and for norms to be strengthened—that is, better enforced against wrong-doers.</p>
<p>Power struggles between economic interest groups were the heart of politics before the countercultures. Conflict between the working class majority and the bourgeois minority drove the main ideological movements, and threatened social collapse. Counterculturalists recognized that such conflicts have no “right” resolution. Everyone may honestly believe their group should win, but that’s nothing more than self-interest.</p>
<p><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Eternalism', 'gloss2')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

A contest of selfish brute political force won’t deliver that. Ethics—a force beyond self-interest—<a href="#chap51">must provide</a> the right answer for politics.</p>
<p>Of course, the countercultures disagreed sharply on some ethical questions. So how do we know that <em>our</em> ethics are right, and <em>theirs</em> are wrong? Religion. Religion gives transcendent, unchallengeable justification for ethical claims. And so both countercultures merged politics with religion, as well as with ethics.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_7t9t2pb" id="extra29_footnoteref2_7t9t2pb" title="One manifestation: Christian Voice, the second-most-important Christian Right organization, issued influential “Morality Ratings” on every member of Congress, based on their support or opposition to its legislative agenda.">2</a> Not only did they reform politics along religious lines, they also turned their politics into pseudo-religions.</p>
<p>Spiritualizing politics, and politicizing everyday personal interactions, was not an altogether bad thing. Sometimes ethical considerations should trump power politics. Sometimes political considerations should alter personal behavior. However, combined with eternalism (absolutism) and universalism (intolerance of diversity of views), the merger has poisoned both politics and everyday life.</p>
<p>Countercultural politics split Americans into two warring tribes. Lack of distinctions between ethics, politics, and religion is a main cause of the bitterness of <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>. When politics is inseparable from morality, your political opponents do not just have different economic incentives, they are <em>evil</em>: immoral, sub-human, demonic. That makes negotiation and compromise impossible.</p>
<p>As politics came to define what it meant to be a good person, many came to define their selves by membership in one counterculture, and rejection of the other. Political success would require solidarity, and both sides promoted the “brotherhood of all counterculture participants.” However, identification with the monist or dualist tribe eventually proved to be an inadequate basis for self.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left">New Left↗︎︎</a> was the monist counterculture’s political program. The Old Left had mainly promoted the economic interest of the working class. The New Left mainly promoted a middle-class personal morality, and mostly lost interest in working class and economic issues.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_7jl28f9" id="extra29_footnoteref3_7jl28f9" title="Although the New Left was officially Marxist and anti-capitalist, it had no substantive economic program. Its supposed anti-capitalism was mainly actually opposition to the emotionally unfulfilling “iron cage” of employment in big-business bureaucracy; to the responsibility of private industry for environmental destruction; to the military-industrial complex’s promotion of unnecessary wars for profit; and to the inadequacy of government anti-poverty programs. The counterculture was not seriously opposed to a market economy, and was mainly enthusiastic about consuming its bounty of nifty new goods.">3</a></p>
<p>Monist politics addressed the crisis of the self: the problems of alienation, angst, and anomie. It started from an improbable synthesis of Marxism, Freudianism, and existentialism—the most important secular systems of meaning in the mid-twentieth century. These systems utterly contradict each other, and also contradict central tenets of the New Left. However, countercultural intellectuals somehow combined them in an ideology of complete liberation of the individual from social norms. Given this incoherent and absolutist origin, it’s not surprising that many of the New Left’s social proposals were simplistic utopian fantasies.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_loosening">Loosening social norms</h3>
<p>In the beginning, the New Left sought mainly to loosen existing social norms, rather than to replace them. The 1950s had been a period of unusually rigid expectations for conformity, which counterculturalists found intolerable. Many of these norms seemed arbitrary, or obsolete, or simply served the selfish interests of elites. Just throwing them off would be a good start. The monist counterculture was, at first, remarkably anti-authoritarian.</p>
<p>After some experience of the consequences of moral breakdown, the counterculture shifted to advocating social reform based on new norms. These were supposed to be more human and natural, in contrast with the industrial, artificial norms of the systematic mode. Leaders intended to create a supportive and egalitarian society. Not everyone got with the program immediately. So, New Left organizations increasingly demanded “discipline,” and monist culture increasingly insisted on correct “consciousness.” The left gradually left behind its New anti-authoritarianism.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_sexual">Sexual liberation</h3>
<p>Sex is perhaps the most personal and private of activities. Before the countercultural merger of the public and private spheres, sex would never have been considered a “political” issue.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_1cj3kdz" id="extra29_footnoteref4_1cj3kdz" title="From the Victorian era forward, do-gooders had campaigned against masturbation and prostitution. Though these campaigns were public, their objects were private, and therefore considered matters of “morality,” not “politics.”">4</a></p>
<p>“Victorian morality” was still the official public ideology of sex and family life in the 1960s. For decades, it had been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_movement_in_the_United_States">increasingly ignored↗︎︎</a> in private—the very definition of hypocrisy and anomie. Improved contraceptive technology and safe, effective treatments for all the STDs of the time removed rational justifications for restrictive sexual norms.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse">Herbert Marcuse↗︎︎</a> was probably the most important New Left theorist. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001KR06QK/?tag=meaningness-20">Eros and Civilization↗︎︎</a> rejects Freud’s pessimistic conclusion in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D2ZZ6K4/?tag=meaningness-20">Civilization and Its Discontents↗︎︎</a> (which I <a href="#chap153_Freud">discussed previously</a>) that the self, particularly its sexual desires, must be subordinated to the social system. Modern political repression, Marcuse argued, is based on sexual repression. For the New Left, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution">sexual revolution↗︎︎</a> was inseparable from the struggle against oppressive corporations and an oppressive state.</p>
<p>This program was partly successful. By the mid-1970s, when the monist counterculture petered out, a majority of Americans had adopted a much more liberal sexual morality than was publicly acceptable in the early ’60s.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_family">Family</h3>
<p>The counterculture considered the Victorian family oppressive for all participants, and set out to dissolve it.</p>
<p>For children, they said, the family was a training ground for a future role as subordinates in an oppressive society. The family’s purpose was to create “authoritarian personalities.” Victorian family theorists had made this entirely explicit: children must be taught unquestioning obedience to arbitrary parental authority in order that they will make “good citizens” as adults. New Left theorists believed this explained the acquiescence of the German and Russian people to Nazi and Stalinist oppression. Families make fascists. In America, families turned out obedient employees, cogs in the machinery of capitalism, whose childhood resignation to emotional abuse also made them joyless, compulsive consumers.</p>
<p>The demand that all men marry and support a wife and children doomed many to an onerous and unwanted breadwinner role. The Beat movement—prologue to hippies—was largely a revolt against work, which implied a revolt against marriage. Hippie men too wanted to sleep around, get high, and listen to music—not spend all their time in a mind-destroying job in order to pay for children they hadn’t asked for.</p>
<p>Hippie women were, likewise, mostly not looking forward to a lifetime stuck at home washing dishes and changing diapers. On the other hand, many discovered that the new social norm that they should have sex with any hippie man who wanted them was not so great either. Some did have children, and then hippie rejection of breadwinning became a problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many more-mainstream women found they enjoyed their careers, and relished the freedom from dependency on men a paycheck gave them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism">Second-wave feminism↗︎︎</a> began as their political program to end workplace discrimination. Feminism is now hazily remembered as part of the ’60s counterculture, probably because they were lumped together as enemies by the dualist counterculture. The reality was more complicated: feminism was long resisted by most male leaders of the New Left, and of the monist religious and cultural movements.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_community">Community</h3>
<p>The Victorian isolated nuclear family ideal was called “traditional,” but it was only a century old. Anthropologists pointed out that it is culturally unusual. Extended families are more typical. These are usually closely woven into broader clans and villages. Children are normally raised by many adults. Unmarried teenage girls also do much of the work, keeping small children out of adults’ hair, and buffering them from excessively harsh parental discipline.</p>
<p>Marcuse, and other countercultural theorists, advocated dissolving nuclear family bonds and replacing them with extended social networks.</p>
<p>Hippie communes put this theory into action. They address both the problem of work and the problem of family. To avoid work, we all move to a remote farm, where we’re out of reach of The System, and we grow all our own food and make everything else we need.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_fba4fk5" id="extra29_footnoteref5_fba4fk5" title="Communal agrarian self-sufficiency is a persistent, malign Romantic fantasy. Brook Farm was a hippie commune of the 1840s which failed in just the same way as the ones of the 1960s. The Utopia Experiment describes another attempt ten years ago, which followed the same script again. (This one led by an academic expert on, among other things, the existential risk posed by runaway artificial intelligence.) The underlying fantasy is that the choiceless mode would be paradise. The reality is that it is awful in material terms, even when its human relationships feel more natural.">5</a> There we get back in touch with the cycles of nature, live life on a human scale, and do just enough wholesome, meaningful work to meet our own needs—instead of slaving for capitalist exploiters. We hold property in common, so everyone has everything they need. We raise children communally, so they always have many loving adults to turn to.</p>
<p>In almost every case, this ends disastrously, usually within a year or so. The founders have high-minded cooperative ideals, but no one actually wants to plow the field, wash the dishes, or feed other people’s children—and if work is not enforced, gradually everyone does less. (This is <em>especially</em> true of communes whose promise is freedom from work!)</p>
<p>Worse, in the absence of strong social norms, communes attract parasites: freeloaders and sociopaths. The brotherhood of all counterculturalists implies that anyone with long hair can come live on the farm. Soon a lot of long-haired guys show up who expect to be fed and laid and supplied with drugs, in exchange for doing nothing. Often they are surly or even violent as well. We are very nice cooperative egalitarian monist people, and they invariably have some sob story for why they can’t be expected to pull their weight, so none of us wants to tell them to get out. No one even feels they have any authority to do so. After a few months, the productive members of the commune give up and leave; and then so do the parasites, when the free food, sex, and drugs run out.</p>
<p>Communes that succeed have strong social norms. Living there requires high commitment to specific values, beyond the countercultural ones. They are mainly interested in being left alone to do their specific thing, rather than trying to impose it on society at large. These make them <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'subcultural', 'gloss4')" title="The subcultural mode abandons the attempt to find universal meanings suitable for everyone. Earlier modes of meaningness claimed to base such meanings on some foundational eternal ordering principle—but there is none.

[Click for details.]">subcultural</a>, not countercultural. Unfortunately, during the countercultural era, successful communes mainly ended up being dominated by charismatic authoritarians (who had the gumption to toss out the parasites) and became exploitative cults. Others, more benign, were run by leaders with strong organizational skills, who imposed formal roles and systems and found a profitable non-agrarian economic basis for their community.</p>
<p>The “brotherhood” fantasy, that the counterculture as a whole could function as a community, was a clear failure. Mostly its egalitarian ideals undermined even attempts to create local communities.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_dualist">The dualist personal was political</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Pro-life rally" height="475" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/better_than_abortion_560x475.jpg" title="Pro-life rally" width="560"/><figcaption class="ctrimgcaption" markdown="1">Image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_pro-life_movement#/media/File:M4l2004.jpg">courtesy↗︎︎</a> Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>
<p>Social conservatives, as well as liberals, found the systematic mode’s private/public split intolerable. It enabled pervasive moral hypocrisy, for instance in the form of “<a href="http://www.modernalternativemama.com/2011/04/30/sunday-christians/">Sunday Christians↗︎︎</a>,” who said the right things in public, but whose private lives were unaffected by religion. Your public and private lives must match to make you an authentic Christian. This is what “born again” meant to many: that you walk the talk.</p>
<p>A godless society makes that walk hard going. There were plenty of sinners in the ’50s, but at least mainstream society expected basic Christian morality. By the mid-’70s, atheists and perverts had taken over America. Hollywood and universities and the government, and even many supposedly Christian churches, all promoted sin. The dualist political program was a grassroots uprising for basic decency, for religious freedom, for taking America back to the traditional values of its founders. (Or so its leaders said.)</p>
<p>They cited the Supreme Court’s decision in <cite>Roe v. Wade</cite>, which legalized abortion, as one of the main reasons for launching their counterculture. The Court’s reasoning in this case was based on the right to privacy: affirming the public/private distinction. The personal, said the Court, was not political.</p>
<p>The founders of the Moral Majority—the foremost dualist-counterculture political organization—were also motivated by their disappointment at “born again” President Jimmy Carter’s rejection of “the personal is political.” Carter refused to publicly oppose abortion despite his private conservative Evangelical religious beliefs.</p>
<p>With the Supreme Court and the President advocating moral hypocrisy, a <em>counter</em>-cultural politics was imperative. The dualist political program worked to collapse the public and private in order to return society to natural, godly norms. This project complemented the dualist religious movement’s <a href="#chap160">technologies of the self</a>, which strengthened souls against the temptations of the new hedonism, nihilism, and atheism.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_large">Large-family values</h3>
<p>Dualists agreed with monists that the “traditional family” was not working. They wrote the opposite prescription, though: it should be strengthened and supported, not dissolved.</p>
<p>“Family values” was the central dualist counterculture slogan. For liberals, the list of issues this covers is puzzling. It seems senseless and disparate, and mostly to have nothing to do with families, although weirdly obsessed with sex. If there is any common theme, perhaps it is “don’t enjoy yourself!”—and it is hard to see how that is anything other than mean-spirited.</p>
<p>Social conservatives seem incapable of explaining “family values” other than in Biblical terms. Such justifications are nonsense, because social conservatives ignore most Biblical prohibitions, and they only started caring about the main “family values” in the 1970s.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_upy2n5n" id="extra29_footnoteref6_upy2n5n" title="I put “conservative” and “traditional” in quotes for this reason.">6</a> Before then, conservative Protestants mostly thought abortion was fine. Sodomy had always been a sin, but an obscure one; fundamentalists had been far more concerned to preach against drinking, dancing, and gambling. The “family values” agenda must have some other, powerful, unstated motivation. Baffled liberals may attribute it to pure malice: hatred rooted in innate evil.</p>
<p>I’ve recently come to a tentative, alternative understanding that makes me much more sympathetic.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_iie8cft" id="extra29_footnoteref7_iie8cft" title="This model was inspired by sociological research by Jason Weeden and his collaborators. See, for instance, “Religious attendance as reproductive support,” “Sociosexuality vs. fast/slow life history,” and “Churchgoers are restricted individuals in fast groups.” My discussion here is not an accurate summary of Weeden’s views, and he might disagree with it. However, if it includes any useful insights, they are mostly his.">7</a> If we take the dualist political agenda as promoting <em>large</em> families, its specific positions suddenly make sense. In fact, conservatives do have significantly more children than liberals, on average.</p>
<p>Three <dfn>reproductive strategies</dfn> have been common in America in the past half-century:<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_22y3bto" id="extra29_footnoteref8_22y3bto" title="These are not the only possible strategies. For example, extended families sharing a single home were mainly extinct in America by the middle of the twentieth century. Polygamy had been banned a century earlier. Both are common elsewhere, and more traditional than the “traditional marriage” promoted by “conservatives.” DINK—dual income, no kids—is an increasingly popular non-reproductive strategy.">8</a></p>
<ol>
<li><dfn>Opportunistic</dfn> mating without marriage, and with minimal parental investment—especially, minimal support by fathers. This is most common among the underclass and lower working class.</li>
<li><dfn>Early</dfn> marriage (teens or early twenties); many children, starting shortly after marriage; emphasis on life-long monogamy; and high total parental investment, spread over many children. This large-family strategy became typical mainly of the upper working class and lower middle class.</li>
<li>Marriage and children <dfn>delayed</dfn> to late twenties or into the thirties in order to accumulate resources (university education and establishing a career); multiple sexual relationships before marriage; fewer children; highest per-child parental investment. This is typical of the upper middle class.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “family values” agenda makes sense when interpreted as promoting the large-family, early-marriage strategy <em>as against</em> both of the others. As a political movement, it attempts to get the government to support its reproductive strategy, and to hinder, prohibit, or punish the others.</p>
<p>Take abortion, the foremost issue of the religious right.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_jxt7wcr" id="extra29_footnoteref9_jxt7wcr" title="I could give similar analyses for the other “family values” issues—drugs, pornography, prostitution, feminism, homosexuality, divorce, and so forth. However, I’m not trying to give a detailed account of social conservatism here, just a sketch of a possible explanation of its principle and function.">9</a> Those pursuing the early strategy have little use for abortion, because they intend to have lots of children as soon as they can. On the other hand, unintended early childbirth ruins the delayed strategy by interrupting education or professional career development. Before legal abortion, it forced many women to abandon their life plans altogether. It set many men back in their careers as well, because to support an unwanted child they had to maximize current income, instead of pursuing education or prestigious but low-paid training positions. Conversely, if you are currently unable to support children at all—often true for those who adopt the opportunistic strategy—abortion may be pragmatically necessary. If we assume that sabotaging the opportunistic and delayed strategies are <em>the point</em> of the anti-abortion movement, its moral condemnation of  both “welfare queens” and “selfish career women” makes sense.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_o08da3i" id="extra29_footnoteref10_o08da3i" title="As with any major movement, different people oppose abortion for different reasons. Some have genuine sympathy for fetuses, or genuinely believe that the Bible forbids abortion. However, these moral and religious concerns can’t explain why most Protestants thought abortion was fine until the mid-’70s, before suddenly making it their central political issue. Many abortion opponents do explicitly connect it with “welfare queens,” “sluts,” and “selfish career women,” consistent with a class-based reproductive-strategy analysis. It’s worth noting also that opposition to abortion partly replaced opposition to contraception, which was only made fully legal in America in 1972, by the Supreme Court decision Eisenstadt v. Baird.">10</a></p>
<p>The large-family, early strategy requires enormous personal sacrifice. If you have six children, then realistically one parent does have to stay home, taking care of them all day every day. Many people enjoy caring for children, but doing it almost your entire adult life, with little time to enjoy or express yourself, is a long hard grind, and emotionally restricting. Financially, in addition to per-child costs, the family has to give up on the potential second income. There is less parental attention and less money per child than in smaller families; preparing and paying for college may be infeasible, for instance. For the employed parent, the financial stress and responsibility, the risk of catastrophe if you lose your job, and the impossibility of taking time off, are equally grinding.</p>
<p>Social liberals should recognize that sticking to this plan, in the face of constant temptations to irresponsibility, is genuinely noble. Religious conservatives congratulate themselves on being “moral” because they are “godly.” Liberal atheists should recognize that they <em>are</em> moral: not because they follow the Bible, but because they work extremely hard, for the sake of others, in difficult circumstances, when they do have alternative options.</p>
<p>In fact, because the big-family strategy is so grueling, it needs intensive memetic support. For many people, switching to strategy 1 (abandoning your wife and children, having an affair, getting high instead of cleaning the house, spending money on something fun the family can’t afford) looks attractive all too often. It is easier, more enjoyable in the short run, and might seem rational for the longer term, too. Constant reminders of absolute, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

A community—a church—that reinforces the message with social confirmation and peer pressure, checking every week to see that you have not gone astray, is invaluable. And, the Christian technologies of the self were designed to make the large-family strategy more emotionally bearable.</p>
<p>The delayed, small-family strategy is the most personally rewarding, for those capable of it. However, it only makes sense if you have something better to do with your twenties. That means college, and the kinds of jobs that require eighty-hour-a-week work at low pay during your twenties in exchange for prestige or a very high salary later: entry-level positions as an academic, doctor, lawyer, or investment banker.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_opwtllk" id="extra29_footnoteref11_opwtllk" title="Plausibly one reason such professions underpay their entry-level positions is to screen out anyone who would prefer strategy 2 to 3—the lower-middle-class riffraff we don’t want in our office.">11</a> Mostly, these are inaccessible for young people from working-class and lower-middle-class backgrounds. If you are going to work forty hours a week on low-skill jobs for the rest of your life, you might as well have children when you are twenty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are not capable of earning enough money to support a wife and children, strategy 2 is out of reach, and you are stuck with reproductive opportunism.</p>
<p>So it is not surprising that the religious right was—and still is—rooted in the upper working class and lower middle class.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_wtiwc1e" id="extra29_footnoteref12_wtiwc1e" title="Of course, it has never been entirely restricted to those classes. In fact, one impetus to the 1980s dualist counterculture was the upward mobility of fundamentalists, from the rural working class to the suburban technical middle-middle class, particularly in the Sunbelt defense industry.">12</a> And this explains its sudden emergence in the 1970s. Economic changes during the 1960s made strategies 1 and 3 both work better than they had. Increased workplace opportunity for women, general prosperity, and more generous welfare support made strategy-1 single motherhood much more feasible and attractive than it had been. Increasing subsidies for college tuition, plus a widening gap between blue-collar and professional/managerial salaries, made the delayed-marriage strategy 3 both easier to access and more attractive.</p>
<p>This meant that people pursuing the large-family strategy saw greater competition from the others than previously. It also meant many were tempted to switch. That could be threatening in several ways. At a practical level, as an example, for a man, it was more likely that your wife would leave and support herself. (This is why wives’ obedience and dependency were so heavily promoted, and why conservatives oppose workplace equality.)</p>
<p>Psychologically, the shifts caused great cognitive dissonance. Strategy 2 <em>had</em> been the best option for most people for decades—but maybe now it wasn’t? Surely I made the right decision—but now the others look better? <a href="#chap24">What can it mean</a>, when fundamental life choices change out from under you? This provokes confusion, resentment, and uncertainty. Anti-rational religious claims were a relatively effective treatment. You could take <em>pride</em> in doing what was religiously right, at great cost, even though it might seem senseless otherwise.</p>
<p>In fact, over the past few decades, many have shifted away from the early-marriage, large-family strategy. Some have moved in the direction of delay. Conservatives have smaller families than they did—although on average they still have almost one more child than liberals. Many send children to college—despite the <a href="http://heterodoxacademy.org/2016/06/02/nothing-to-see-here/">discrimination conservatives may face↗︎︎</a> there. On the other hand, economic trends that started in the 1970s have accelerated, making it ever more difficult to raise a family on a single working-class income. Many have despaired, given up, and slid into strategy 1—which may seem like total failure.</p>
<p>If this strategy analysis of social conservatism is right, its <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalistic', 'gloss5')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalistic</a> religious rhetoric is a smoke screen. The “family values” agenda is just self-interested: it tries to harm competing social classes and benefit its own. The large-family strategy it promotes is not “more moral”; it is good for some people and bad for others. Forcing it on the underclass—“you can’t have children unless you have a steady job and stay married”—means they will fail, and be eliminated as competition. Forcing it on the upper middle class—“you can’t have sex unless it results in children, and mothers have to stay home to care for them”—eliminates much of their advantage.</p>
<p>Still, this understanding of what they are up to makes me more, not less, sympathetic to social conservatives. They are not just being irrationally hateful. Pursuing self-interest, and moralizing it to conceal selfish motivations even from oneself, is universal. It can’t be condemned.</p>
<p>Also, from this perspective, one can see sexual liberalism as mainly self-interested politicking for strategy 3. Getting to sleep around, while waiting to have children until you’ve gotten your professional degree and established your career, makes your twenties tolerable.</p>
<p>The core of the monist counterculture was college-educated, middle class people in their twenties. Some went back to the “straight world” in their thirties, pursuing the delayed strategy. Some “dropped out” permanently and defaulted to the opportunistic strategy. You can view their contempt for “traditional marriage” as merely a self-interested attempt to harm those pursuing strategy 2.</p>
<p>Indeed, while sexual freedom is functional for some people, the change in social attitudes since the ’60s has been devastating for others. I find plausible arguments made by Charles Murray, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00540PAXS/?tag=meaningness-20">Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010↗︎︎</a>, and Theodore Dalrymple, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1566635055/?tag=meaningness-20">Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass↗︎︎</a>. The loosening of social norms, particularly around sex, drugs, and family, which originated in the monist counterculture and which is propagated by the leftish upper middle class, has been catastrophic for the working class. Millions who might have led decent early-marriage strategy-2 lives have slipped instead into the underclass: destructive drug addiction, permanent unemployment, crime, child neglect and abuse.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_7ndeph5" id="extra29_footnoteref13_7ndeph5" title="Of course, economic changes that have disadvantaged the working class are also major factors.">13</a></p>
<h3 id="extra29_community2">Dualist community</h3>
<p>The monist counterculture’s Romantic fantasy of community was the rural commune. One reason those failed was that most hippies were from middle-class urban backgrounds, and had no clue how to start a balky tractor, snake a drain, or slaughter a hog. The core of the dualist counterculture came from the rural working class, for whom such things are everyday tasks. If only they had been able to cooperate!</p>
<p>In fact, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_freak">Jesus freaks↗︎︎</a>”—Charismatic Christian hippies—formed some of the most successful communes. Their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement">Jesus Movement↗︎︎</a>, which predated the main dualist counterculture, was an important bridge between the two, working out ways hippie innovations could be adapted for use by Christian conservatives.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_h0kpbmo" id="extra29_footnoteref14_h0kpbmo" title="See Countercultural Conservatives: American Evangelicalism from the Postwar Revival to the New Christian Right, pp. 101, 131-4, et passim.">14</a></p>
<p>The dualist counterculture appealed particularly to people from rural backgrounds who experienced culture shock when they moved to cities and office-park suburbs for work. The main dualist fantasy of community was an idealization of “traditional” small-town life—“traditional” meaning “all the good stuff with none of the bad.” Despite much talk, the counterculture had no credible program for fixing rampant rural social pathology, so this was no more realistic than the hippie commune movement.</p>
<p>Churches were centers of the dualist counterculture. Church community can provide substantial material support, in addition to the memetic and social support I mentioned earlier. However, existing church institutions were inadequate. The counterculture innovated extensively in sermons and service style, music, management structure, marketing, architecture, and social ministries.</p>
<p>The most successful new-model churches grew explosively into <dfn><a href="http://hirr.hartsem.edu/bookshelf/thumma_article2.html">megachurches↗︎︎</a></dfn>, a qualitatively new form of social organization. Like the few successful communes, these became <dfn>subsocieties</dfn>: local communities with a distinctive subculture that served a wide array of social needs. This was far more functional in practice than “traditional small-town life.” Hoping to reform small towns nationally was a characteristically countercultural project; megachurches are a subcultural one. Therefore, I will discuss them in detail in the next chapter, rather than here.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_upshot">Upshot and aftermath</h2>
<p>In the end, neither counterculture had a workable program for <a href="#chap160">reforming the self</a>, or society, or for <a href="#chap159">renegotiating their relationship</a>.</p>
<p>Although the proposals of both countercultures were <em>extreme</em>, neither was sufficiently <em>radical</em>. Both left intact a structure of individuals and a nation-scale society confronting each other across an unbridgeable gap. Both merely fiddled with details on either side of the chasm, rather than proposing a fundamentally different approach to the problems of individualism and collectivism. This is a major reason <a href="#chap166">the countercultures failed</a>.</p>
<p>Their social proposals were simplistic and utopian. Social liberalism is not <em>right</em>. It is good only <em>for some people</em>. Social conservatism is also not right; just good for some people. The fact is, different sorts of people need different social arrangements, including different sexual, family, and community norms.</p>
<p>Later I will argue that this was the <a href="#chap166">fundamental error</a> of the countercultures: universalism. Both tried to impose their preferred way of life on everyone else. However, neither way was accepted by a majority, let alone everyone.</p>
<p>This failure brought out totalitarian tendencies in both countercultures—particularly the dualist one. Totalitarianism, too, makes the personal political and seeks to destroy the boundary between a social system and individuals. It would take extreme state repression to force everyone into a uniform code of sexual morality. Imposing an early-marriage large-family strategy is, indeed, a central project of Islamism, a <a href="#chap164">totalitarian dualist counterculture</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_1dk4gir" id="extra29_footnoteref15_1dk4gir" title="Islamism was founded by Sayyid Qutb, after spending two years in America, 1949-51. His horror at American sexual openness seems to have been a major inspiration for the movement. “The American girl is well acquainted with her body’s seductive capacity. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs and she shows all this and does not hide it.”">15</a> Fortunately, in America, both countercultures grudgingly accepted their democratic failure, with only minor terrorist violence from extremists on each side.</p>
<p>Although neither counterculture’s political program was adopted in full, both partially succeeded in transforming American government, law, and social norms. (More about that in “<a href="#chap162">Rotating politics ninety degrees clockwise</a>.”) Both caused considerable harm to society and to individuals, but also had some benefits.</p>
<p>Making explicit that the self/society boundary needed softening and reworking was a helpful step toward the subcultural mode. The conflict between the countercultures made clearer what the problems of self and society are. It made some people aware that social systems are contingent constructions, not absolute truths, so we all have a responsibility to help them evolve. Although both countercultures were <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss7" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalist', 'gloss7')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

[Click for details.]">eternalist</a>, most people found themselves somewhere in the middle, which made eternalism, monism, and dualism less credible. That too set us up for the subcultural mode’s move away from all three of those <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss8" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'confused stances', 'gloss8')" title="Confused stances try to avoid the anxiety of ambiguity through fixation and denial of a dimension of meaningness. [Click for details.]">confused stances</a>.</p>
<p>Subculturalism developed <em>structurally</em> new models of the self, of society, and their relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledging the fragmentation of the self as inevitable made it increasingly unproblematic.</li>
<li>Acknowledging diversity (including diversity of moral views) allows like-minded people to form distinctive subsocieties. This provided a layer of organization intermediate between the family and the nation-state.</li>
<li>Thus, the extreme ideals of existentialist individualism (the one-pointed self perfectly separated from social influence) and totalitarian collectivism (the boundaryless self entirely dissolved in social conformity) both lost their appeal.</li>

<p class="intro_para">
What they <em>do</em> teach you at STEM school is how to think and act within rational systems. What they mostly <em>don’t</em> teach you is how to evaluate, choose, combine, modify, discover, or create systems. Those skills are actually <a href="#extra12">more important</a> for social, cultural, and personal progress. Learning them is also rarer, and more difficult—currently!
</p>
<p>This post sketches a hypothetical curriculum for developing these <dfn>meta-systematic</dfn> capabilities. It’s preliminary; perhaps even premature. There is no existing presentation of this subject that I know of, which makes it more difficult than it should be. My understanding of the topic draws on a dozen academic disciplines, each written in its own unnecessarily obscure code. Both my understanding, and the pedagogical structure I’m proposing, are tentative and incomplete.</p>
<p>Partly this presentation hopes to inspire some readers to pursue meta-systematicity; partly it is a plan for a large project that I hope to pursue myself; partly I hope you will give feedback, make suggestions, or contribute ideas to the project too!</p>
<!--break-->
<h2 id="extra29_goal">Goal and audience</h2>
<p>The overall goal is to take you from systematic rationality to meta-rationality as quickly and painlessly as possible. The curriculum should re-present insights I’ve found in many semi-relevant fields, as clearly and simply as possible, in STEM-friendly terms, in a structured, sequential format.</p>
<p>Learning meta-systematic skills shouldn’t be so hard, and meta-systematic understanding is particularly valuable in STEM. It is inherently <em>somewhat</em> conceptually difficult; but probably not as difficult as, say, senior-year undergraduate physics. However, it does have cognitive prerequisites.</p>
<p>This curriculum is for people who have mastered systematic rationality, specifically in a STEM framework. For the most part, you have to have a thorough understanding of how to work <em>within</em> systems before it’s feasible to step up and out of them, to manipulate them from above. There are other routes to mastering systematic rationality—through experience as a manager in a bureaucratic organization, for instance—but this curriculum will assume a STEM background.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement might be an undergraduate STEM degree; but research experience at the graduate level may be needed. You have to have seen how many different systems work, and—more importantly—how they fail. At the undergraduate level, you are mainly shielded from the failures, and systems get presented as though they were Absolute Truth. Or, at least, they are taught as though Absolute Truth lurks somewhere in the vicinity, obscured only by complex details. Recognizing that there is no Absolute Truth anywhere is a small downpayment on the price of entry to meta-systematicity.</p>
<p>That may already have set off warning bells. Woomeisters and postmodernists say things like that—and if you think they are horribly wrong, I agree!</p>
<p>This curriculum is about how to do STEM better. It is not about taking you <em>out</em> of a STEM worldview into some alternative. Everything here is <em>on top of</em> that view. It addresses limitations in the way STEM is typically taught and practiced, but does not contradict any of its content. There is no woo involved—including no STEM-flavored woo, such as neurobabble or quantum or Gödel woo.</p>
<p>In fact, a critical step is letting go of some of STEM’s own woo—<a href="#chap63">quasi-religious beliefs</a> about the ability of rationality to deliver <a href="#chap32">certainty</a>, <a href="#chap33">understanding</a>, and <a href="#chap34">control</a>. For that letting-go, the meta-systematic mode demands that one develop an additional cognitive <em>style</em>. Routine STEM is easy for those who are precise and rigid of mind, and so find promises of certainty, understanding, and control particularly comforting. Meta-systematicity requires openness, flexibility, daring, and uncommonly realistic common sense—<em>as well as</em> technical precision.</p>
<p>I’ll begin with some <a href="#extra29_definitions">preliminary definitions</a>, and provide a brief <a href="#extra29_arc">overview of the curriculum</a>. Then <a href="#extra29_modules">most of the page</a> goes through the syllabus, organized into ten modules, in more detail. That is still just a summary, which may be difficult to make sense of on its own. I’ve included in it links to resources that provide more explanation; some of my own web pages, and articles and books by others. At this stage in the project, even these leave many holes, which I hope to fill gradually. Many of the books are seriously difficult reading; the hypothetical curriculum would extract and explain clearly their relevant points.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_definitions">Some loose definitions</h2>
<p>By <dfn>system</dfn>, I mean, roughly, a collection of related concepts and rules that can be printed in a book of less than 10kg and followed consciously. A <dfn>rational</dfn> system is one that is “good” in some way. There are many different conceptions of what makes a system rational. Logical consistency is one; decision-theoretic criteria can form another. The details don’t matter here, because we are going to take rationality for granted.</p>
<p><dfn>Meta-systematic</dfn> cognition is reasoning about, and acting on, systems from outside them, without using a system to do so. (Reasoning about systems using another system is systematic, and meta, but not “meta-systematic” in this sense.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_f9zw8br" id="extra29_footnoteref1_f9zw8br" title="“Meta-systematicity” is non-systematic just by definitional fiat. This is not an empirical claim; rather, I’m declaring any systematic reasoning about systems to be non-meta-systematic for terminological convenience. Otherwise I’d keep having to say “non-systematic meta-systematicity,” which would be tedious. I do make the empirical claim that much reasoning about systems has to be non-systematic, but this is distinct from the definitional fiat.">1</a>) <dfn>Meta-rationality</dfn>, then, is “good” meta-systematic cognition. Mostly I use the terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>One field I draw on is the empirical <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">psychology of adult development↗︎︎</a>, as investigated by Robert Kegan particularly. This framework describes systematic rationality as <dfn><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">stage 4↗︎︎</a></dfn> in the developmental path. <dfn><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">Stage 5↗︎︎</a></dfn> is meta-systematic. However, as far as I know, no one from this discipline has applied the stage theory to STEM competence specifically. Empirical study of cognitive development in graduate-level STEM students would be helpful,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_0tzhgtt" id="extra29_footnoteref2_0tzhgtt" title="Maybe this has been done by education theorists? They certainly look at high-school level STEM learning. There is also a relevant literature on “post-formal operations,” in the Piagetian framework, but I haven’t yet looked at it seriously.">2</a> but in the absence of that I’m working from a combination of first principles, bits of theory taken from many apparently-unrelated disciplines, anecdata, and personal experience.</p>
<p>According to this framework, there is also a <dfn>stage 4.5</dfn>, in which you <a href="#extra12_gap">lose the quasi-religious belief in systems</a>, but haven’t yet developed the meta-systematic understanding that can replace blind faith. Stage 4.5 leaves you vulnerable to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss0')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>, including ontological despair (nothing seems true), epistemological anxiety (nothing seems knowable), and existential depression (nothing seems meaningful). It’s common to <a href="#extra12_postrationalism">get stuck</a> at 4.5, which is awful.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_arc">The arc of the path</h2>
<p>Overall, the curriculum leads from 4 to 5, while aiming to avoid the nihilism of 4.5; or at least to minimize its trauma, by leading you forward from 4.5 to 5.</p>
<p>The term “4.5” prompts the thought that the path could be structured as ten substages; 4.1, 4.2, and so on, past 4.5 to 4.6 and eventually on to 5.0. This is a severe “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_of_notation">abuse of notation↗︎︎</a>”; the empirical data do not support it. However, it may appeal to STEM folks’ appreciation of crisp structures. So I am provisionally adopting it, taking the spurious definiteness as humorous.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>the key</em> to meta-systematicity is accepting that perfect definiteness is never available. Or, in other words, <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss1')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> is pervasive. Meta-systematicity is non-systematic by definition, so it cannot have as cut-and-dried a curriculum as undergraduate physics. The path is necessarily somewhat nebulous. The ten steps are artificial; in reality cognitive development is never altogether linear.</p>
<p>The obstacles to developing meta-systematic skill are emotional as much as cognitive. Everyone must navigate two emotional crises.</p>
<p>When you have watched rational systems fail enough times, you are ready to move beyond stage 4. However, you may also start to sense the nihilism that lies ahead. You recoil in horror from the possibility that all systems may fail conclusively. Then you may cling even more tightly to the safety of the known, and try harder to persuade yourself that the <a href="#chap31">eternalistic lies</a> and rationalist myths are true. This may make it difficult to take even the first steps beyond stage 4.</p>
<p>It should be helpful to make explicit from the beginning that falling into nihilism at stage 4.5 is a possibility, but that it is avoidable if you are suitably equipped. Also, that beyond 4.5 is stage 5, which is <em>more</em> functional than stage 4 (whereas 4.5 can render you practically catatonic if you don’t know how to deal with it).</p>
<p>The second potential emotional crisis comes at 4.5, when you fully understand that systems can’t function in their own terms, but don’t yet have a clear understanding of why they <em>do</em> work. Three supports may help:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Testimony that such understanding is possible</li>
<li>Gaining <em>some</em> conceptual understanding and experience of meta-systematicity ahead of time</li>
<li>A clear explanation of why nihilism is factually and conceptually mistaken</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Modules 4.1 and 4.2 introduce meta-systematic cognition, to give some confidence that it’s distinctive and valuable, and that you can do it.</li>
<li>Modules 4.3 and 4.4 show how stage 4’s eternalistic understanding of systems is mistaken.</li>
<li>Module 4.5 explains why nihilism is also wrong.</li>
<li>Modules 4.6-5.0 explain how systems actually do work, and teach meta-systematic cognitive skills.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 4.3 and 4.4, we challenge the systematic worldview’s understanding of how systems themselves work. We demonstrate that the certainty, understanding, and control promised by 4 is false; but also begin to show that a different kind of knowledge is possible through meta-systematicity, and meta-systematic skills give you more confidence, understanding, and influence than are genuinely possible at 4.</p>
<p>By the end of 4.4, you need to have abandoned the hope that systems can ever be made to “work” in the way stage 4 assumes. You have to really, truly, permanently give up on that to go further. But then the 4.5 module explains in detail why nihilism is wrong. Systems obviously <em>do</em> work—just not in the way claimed. If you assimilate both the 4.4 and 4.5 material, you recognize that nebulosity and <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss2')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a> are inseparable, and so there must be some alternative to both eternalism and nihilism. And, from 4.1 and 4.2, you have some vague sense of what that must be.</p>
<p>Module 4.6 introduces the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss3')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a> that acknowledges both nebulosity and pattern. The subsequent modules take that as given, and develop cognitive skills that work with their interplay. 4.7 explains how systems actually work (namely, by non-systematic situated meaning-making) at the nuts-and-bolts level. 4.8 and 4.9 develop skillful meta-systematic cognitive patterns, at increasing levels of complexity and breadth.</p>
<p>5.0 could point out that, according to developmental psychologists, all aspects of the person typically progress more-or-less in sync. This curriculum concentrates only on cognition, because that’s what a STEM audience most wants to hear about. Having made the 4-to-5 shift cognitively, it should be easier to understand and appreciate the parallel changes that are possible in emotional life, relationships, culture, and society.</p>

<h3 id="extra29_4.1">4.1 Meta-rationality is a thing and you already do it</h3>
<p>Modules 4.1 and 4.2 aim to inspire you to step beyond stage 4, with promises of <em>mad cognitive skills</em> of types you haven’t learned before, and which are useful in STEM practice. To the extent possible at this stage, they should deliver on the promise, actually teaching meta-systematic skills that you will find valuable even if you go no further.</p>
<p>4.1 is an introduction. It gives simple examples of meta-systematic cognition, with exercises that leave you confident that:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>There is such a thing</li>
<li>You can do it, and in fact already had been doing it</li>
<li>It’s not something you’ve been taught much about before</li>
<li>It’s useful and you want to learn more.</li>
</ul>
<p>“<a href="#extra13">A first lesson in meta-rationality</a>” and “<a href="#extra23">Judging whether a system applies</a>” fit nicely in this 4.1 category.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.2">4.2 Developing meta-rational skills</h3>
<p>Here we go through all the various meta-systematic operations—evaluating, choosing, combining, modifying, discovering, and creating systems—in “sandboxes” that give simple illustrations for each. The Bongard problems of the “<a href="#extra13">first lesson</a>” are a sandbox for system discovery, for example.</p>
<p>Then we’ll look at some more serious, real-world examples, to give confidence that meta-systematicity is valuable for more than solving artificial puzzles.</p>
<p>“<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>” includes some 4.2-level material. I wrote it before I was thinking in the sequential framework I’m suggesting here, so it’s pretty scattershot, with bits that might fit into several modules.</p>
<p>4.1 and 4.2 leave intact the stage 4 understanding of what systems are and how they work. At this point, the aim is to “create space” around systems: to challenge the implicit assumption that operating within them is the whole story, and to show how acting on systems from the territory outside is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.3">4.3 Nebulosity and the limits of systems</h3>
<p>Here we begin to break up the systematic worldview’s fundamental assumptions. There’s several quite different ways of going at this, and 4.3 and 4.4 should lead the student through several; one may lead to understanding where others don’t.</p>
<p>Here’s one, in abstract summary. Any system describes the world in terms of a vocabulary of entities, categories, properties, and relationships. According to the systematic worldview, the system works because terms of the vocabulary correspond to entities, categories, properties, and relationships that actually exist in the world, and which work the way the system says they do.</p>
<p>However, the human-scale world doesn’t have any entities, categories, properties, or relationships. Not objectively, anyway! The physical world is nebulous—cloud-like—<a href="#chap95">without any definite boundaries</a>. There are no objectively-separable entities, because everything is somewhat mushy around the edges. Even after you divide the world up into entities by fiat, they never quite fit into categories. Your taxonomy always has some vagueness, making for marginal cases that can’t be classified meaningfully. Similarly, your imputed entities never definitely have the properties you enumerated. (Where does “red” end and “orange” begin? How much speckling can an apple have before you no longer want to call it “red”?) And so also with relationships.</p>
<p>Brian Smith’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262692090/?tag=meaningness-20">On the Origin of Objects↗︎︎</a> discusses this in detail.</p>
<p>“No amount of evidence can fix a wrong theory” is the title of what will probably be my next metablog post. It illustrates the failure of rational systems with two case studies, epicycles and <a href="#chap73">nutrition</a>, and fits neatly in module 4.3. It also introduces the basic ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaotic dynamics↗︎︎</a>, which are another common reason for rational systems not “working” in their own terms.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.4">4.4 Systems can never “work”</h3>
<p>This module continues the theme of 4.3, using numerous examples and forms of rational reasoning to undermine the cognitive illusions and emotional appeal of systematic eternalism: its promises that complete certainty, understanding, and control are possible, at least in principle.</p>
<p>Here we need to address objections that systems can be grounded in fundamental physics or mathematics, so they can (ultimately, at least) be made reliable. These are straightforward logical errors, which can be rectified with straightforward rational arguments. (A section of the “first lesson” <a href="#extra13_church-turing">dispelled one such objection</a> rooted in the Church-Turing Thesis.)</p>
<p>Despite the module’s title, it’s not that rational systems don’t work; much of the time, they obviously do, and are indispensable. It’s that systems don’t work for the reasons ideological rationality claims they do. They do work for quite different ones (which we’ll learn in 4.7-4.9). This matters because rationality’s failure modes are not the ones rationalists expect.</p>
<p>Rationality expects failures due to <dfn>known unknowns</dfn>: parameter uncertainty, incomplete information of determinate types, and insufficient computational power, for instance. These sorts of failures can be planned for, and mitigated by adjustments within the system.</p>
<p>Systems don’t expect, and can’t cope with, <dfn>unknown unknowns</dfn>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_mmcjdb7" id="extra29_footnoteref3_mmcjdb7" title="This term was accidentally popularized by Donald Rumsfeld. It had been used by others for decades before, however.">3</a> For example: relevant common-sense observations can’t be made to fit into the model because its vocabulary doesn’t make the necessary distinctions; a sensible rule is misinterpreted in a specific case; significant aspects of the circumstances are unexpectedly not accounted for by the model <em>at all</em>, so it’s not even wrong, but entirely inapplicable; the system’s recommended course of action is infeasible, ignored, or obstructed, and the next-best option is outside its scope.</p>
<p>These sorts of failures are the raw materials that the meta-systematic skills of 4.7-4.9 work with! But for a stage 4 sensibility, they either have to be denied and ignored, or else they result in total breakdown.</p>
<p>Rittel and Webber’s “<a href="http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf">Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning↗︎︎</a>” discusses “wicked problems,” which cannot be solved systematically. In fact, “wicked” problems can’t be <em>solved</em> at all. But they are important, and can be addressed intelligently by other means. Most problems that involve more than a few people are “wicked” in this sense—which may explain why STEM-educated people tend not to like those sorts of problems!</p>
<p>Hubert Dreyfus’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002XQ21X8/?tag=meaningness-20">What Computers Still Can’t Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason↗︎︎</a> is a rather dated discussion of artificial intelligence. However, it is actually a first-principles, rational argument against the sufficiency of systematic rationality <i>per se</i>, and applies to people as much as to computers.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_a6u2jjj" id="extra29_footnoteref4_a6u2jjj" title="And also as little. That is: humans avoid the critique by being non-systematic much of the time, and there’s no reason in principle to think artificial agents can’t do the same. In the first edition of this book, Dreyfus assumed that computers could only be programmed to operate systematically, which was reasonable given the claims of AI researchers of the time, who were attempting to program systematic rationality. The second edition adds a discussion of so-called “neural networks,” which supposedly do not attempt systematic rationality.">4</a> I believe the argument is basically correct. Dreyfus’s conceptual framework is based in Heidegger’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B928VUE/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a>, which I’ll mention again later.</p>
<p>James C. Scott’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D8JJYWA/?tag=meaningness-20">Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed↗︎︎</a> describes ways that rational systems cause catastrophes when they collide with nebulosity. It’s <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">recommended highly↗︎︎</a> by many smart people, but I haven’t managed to read it yet.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.5">4.5 Cloud-treading over the nihilist abyss</h3>
<p>The eternalistic myth of systems is that they provide definite ground: solid justifications for understanding, and guarantees of effectiveness for action. By implication, without a correct system, knowledge is impossible and action is futile.</p>
<p>Module 4.4 showed that there is no solid place to stand anywhere. Knowledge, understanding, and action can only ever be vague, ambiguous, and fluid. That is: nebulous; cloud-like.</p>
<p>This may—perhaps should!—induce severe vertigo. The aim is to bring the student to a total emotional, as well as intellectual, disillusionment with rationalist eternalism. You realize you are over the abyss of meaninglessness, with nothing but wisps of cloud between you and the bottomless darkness beneath. This can produce panic, rage, and depression: <a href="#chap84">symptoms of the nihilism</a> of stage 4.5.</p>
<p>I believe those can be prevented; but some degree of emotional upset may be unavoidable. Moving conclusively beyond systematicity inevitably induces <a href="#chap84">feelings of loss</a>—loss of your previous way of making sense of the world, and of your previous, systematic self.</p>
<p>Curriculum module 4.5 addresses the danger of stage 4.5 nihilism.</p>
<p>Since there never <em>was</em> any ground, you always <em>were</em> walking on clouds—and that worked pretty well! Your eternalistic belief in systems was mistaken, but your activity was relatively effective nonetheless.</p>
<p>In other words: because we <em>do</em> understand and act effectively, therefore we <em>can</em>. The remaining work, from 4.6 to 5.0, is learning more about how that can be, and how to do it better.</p>
<p>Ideally, pointing this out is sufficient. Nihilism is just obviously wrong, and refuted by every moment of everyday experience. However, there are <a href="#extra24">dozens of supposedly rational arguments</a> in favor of nihilism, which may suddenly seem compelling when you reach stage 4.5—particularly if you come from a STEM background. Each of these arguments is straightforwardly mistaken, on straightforward factual, rational grounds, but there are so many of them that they can oppress you into despair.</p>
<p>Oddly, no one in any intellectual tradition seems to have written a clear and accurate explanation of why nihilism is wrong. Most explicit opposition comes from eternalism, and boils down to “God exists, so nihilism is wrong” and/or “nihilism implies murder is OK, so even considering it is taboo.” More sophisticated writers take it for granted that nihilism is obviously wrong, and so don’t bother to refute it.</p>
<p>I think a detailed refutation of nihilism will be valuable <em>anyway</em>, for two reasons. Falling into nihilism is a genuine danger (especially for STEM folks); and fear that nihilism <em>might</em> be right <a href="#chap36">is one of the main reasons</a> people stick to eternalism even when it is also obviously wrong. So this is near the front of my writing To Do list.</p>
<p>Nietzsche began working on a refutation of nihilism near the end of his working life. His <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YI5BE0/?tag=meaningness-20">Twilight of the Idols↗︎︎</a> is a preface to that project. I consider it perhaps the high point of Western philosophy. The single-page chapter “<a href="http://www.austincc.edu/adechene/Nietzsche%20true%20world.pdf">How the “True World” finally became a fable↗︎︎</a>” is an intense summary of his summary—and also of the whole Western philosophical tradition and what is wrong with it.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_d3plzap" id="extra29_footnoteref5_d3plzap" title="Because it’s highly condensed, it may be incomprehensible without some knowledge of the tradition. One key to understanding is that “Königsbergian” is a reference to Kant specifically. The supposed “true world” of Nietzsche’s stage 3 is Kant’s ding an sich, “the thing in itself.” That is the inaccessible “noumenon,” or true reality, as opposed to the defective “phenomenon” that appears to the senses. This is a catastrophically bad idea, which leads straight to nihilism.">5</a> As for the overcoming of nihilism, he writes there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bright day; breakfast; return of <i>bon sens</i> and cheerfulness; Plato’s embarrassed blush; pandemonium of all free spirits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">Robert Kegan’s work↗︎︎</a> can be read as a guide to the transitions from eternalism, to nihilism, to the complete stance. He wrote primarily about the emotional and relational aspects, although he does describe the epistemological ones in passing. My work here could be taken as filling in the details he omitted.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.6">4.6 The dance of nebulosity and pattern</h3>
<p>Systems, we saw in 4.3, don’t deal well with nebulosity, so they try to <a href="hiding-from-nebulosity">avoid it↗︎︎</a>, <a href="#chap49">ignore it</a>, <a href="#chap43">pretend it doesn’t exist</a>, <a href="#chap42">hope it goes away</a>, or <a href="#chap47">destroy it</a>. Going beyond systematicity requires acknowledging nebulosity. Nebulosity by itself would be unworkable, but it always intertwines with patterns, and effective meta-systematicity works with their inseparable union.</p>
<p>My understanding here draws heavily on <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/12/12/emptiness-zen-tantra-dzogchen/">Dzogchen↗︎︎</a>, a branch of Buddhism. The most relevant work I know of is Ju Mipham’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0861711572/?tag=meaningness-20">Beacon of Certainty↗︎︎</a>, which unfortunately is extremely difficult. The content is only moderately difficult, but the presentation assumes familiarity with the technical vocabulary of academic Buddhist philosophy and its two thousand years of arcane controversies. In a sense, <cite><a href="/#toc">Meaningness</a></cite> could be read as an attempt to make the <cite>Beacon of Certainty</cite> accessible.</p>
<p>Taoism, which I know much less well, also developed a sophisticated understanding of nebulosity and pattern. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZDNYWA/?tag=meaningness-20">Zhuangzi↗︎︎</a> is the root text. It is easy to read (unlike Mipham), but I found it difficult to understand. The mathematician Raymond Smullyan developed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B72H3SC/?tag=meaningness-20">an interpretation↗︎︎</a> that may appeal particularly to STEM folks.</p>
<p>From Taoism, I’ve found most valuable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226415317/?tag=meaningness-20">The Great Image Has No Form, or On the Nonobject through Painting↗︎︎</a>. It is notionally about Chinese landscape painting, but actually about nebulosity and pattern. I wrote about it <a href="#extra26_greatimage">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the Western tradition, ideas about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order">spontaneous order↗︎︎</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent behavior↗︎︎</a>” are relevant. The most sophisticated treatments are in economics and in evolutionary theory. These two are closely linked, with each influencing the other throughout their history. Norman Barry’s <cite><a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/LtrLbrty/bryTSO.html">The Tradition of Spontaneous Order↗︎︎</a></cite> is a useful historical review of the economic strand.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.7">4.7 Orienting to a rule: the occasion of use</h3>
<p>Where 4.6 is abstract, general, and may sound vaguely mystical,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_zcg5ezc" id="extra29_footnoteref6_zcg5ezc" title="Economic theory is not all that mystical, although its relationship with reality is often dubious.">6</a> 4.7 gets down to nuts and bolts.</p>
<p>So how <em>do</em> rational systems work, if they don’t mirror the True World? Module 4.7 answers: through <dfn>non-systematic situated meaning-making</dfn>. Put another way: by intelligent interpretation of the system as meaningful in specific but necessarily nebulous circumstances. Or: through the participants in an interaction orienting to a rule as a resource on that particular occasion. These answers are still highly abstract, but the module will show how it is possible to understand them, and to demonstrate their accuracy empirically, in extreme specificity and detail.</p>
<p>Heidegger’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B928VUE/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a> is the root text for non-systematic situated meaning-making. That book is extremely difficult, so I would recommend instead Hubert Dreyfus’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262540568/?tag=meaningness-20">Being-in-the-World↗︎︎</a>, a readable explanation of the relevant parts of Heidegger’s work. It is still relatively abstract.</p>
<p>The nuts-and-bolts understanding comes from <dfn>ethnomethodology</dfn>, which investigates the question “how do systems actually work” through minutely detailed observation and analysis of actual people actually using systems. This immediately eviscerates the rationalist view, and demonstrates the correct alternative fairly painlessly.</p>
<p>Empiricism for the win! Isn’t it obvious this is the right approach? And yet ethnomethodology remains almost entirely unknown outside a handful of academic departments.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_94ru095" id="extra29_footnoteref7_94ru095" title="John Seely Brown, the genius director of Xerox PARC, recognized its value, and hired several ethnomethodologists. They did some extremely interesting work on how people use information systems, with implications for how those could work better. One of these studies wound up making Xerox a great deal of money. I learned about ethnomethodology from that group when I worked there. I had lost track of JSB for the past 15 years or so; I see he has a new book that looks relevant to my interests!">7</a> Part of the problem is the lack of an accessible introduction. I started with John Heritage’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DUVKHKE/?tag=meaningness-20">Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology↗︎︎</a>, which is excellent but not easy. (Garfinkel founded the field; his own writing is nearly impenetrable.)</p>
<p>Mainly ethnomethodology is difficult because it requires a new way of seeing. Many people report experiencing a sudden flip in perception when they “get” it. In order to “get it,” you have to set aside everything you think you know—in order to actually look, without mistaken assumptions. Otherwise, you hallucinate systems where there are none. Theoretical presuppositions get in the way of accurate observation.</p>
<p>The Anglophone rationalist tradition (analytic philosophy, cognitive science, artificial intelligence) assumes that systems live in your head. They don’t. Representations are not datastructures. Rules are not effective procedures. Plans do not engender action. Until you set those delusions aside, when you look at people acting, you keep asking “what rule in their head made them do that?”, which prevents you from seeing what is going on.</p>
<p>The Continental social tradition assumes that systems are vast, abstract structures of oppression, with elite-imposed power rules, which determine the details of individual interactions. This is backward. Ethnomethodology reveals social systems as extremely concrete, detailed patterns of interaction. Large-scale social structures are determined by these details, not the other way around. Constantly asking “how does this exemplify oppression?” prevents you from seeing what is going on.</p>
<p>So, what is going on? Rules work through their interpretation by the participants in a concrete situation. That interpretation bridges the gap between the system’s theoretical vocabulary and the nebulosity of the visible specifics. Such interpretation is inherently, necessarily improvisational and collaborative. In ethnomethodological terms, participants <dfn>orient to</dfn> rules. They take rules as a <em>resource</em> for making sense of what everyone involved is doing, but the rules don’t <em>govern</em> the action in any way. Rules are routinely violated; and then there are patterns of reaction and repair.</p>
<p>My brief paper “<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J92-4006">Computer Rules, Conversational Rules↗︎︎</a>” may help explain this. It tries to join the ethnomethodological and cognitivist understandings, and explains ethnomethodological conversation analysis by analogy to computer networking protocols.</p>

<p>Taking different examples as prototypes leads to the “vision flip.” For the Enlightenment tradition, Newton’s theory of gravity is the universal prototype. To caricature only slightly, ideological rationalism imagines you have an orrery in your head computing <i>F = GmM/r<sup>2</sup></i>, and it’s connected to your muscles and makes you do things. Newtonian mechanics is incredibly cool, but most things don’t work that way. For the Continental social tradition, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">enclosure movement↗︎︎</a> is the universal prototype. To caricature only slightly, social theory imagines that reality consists of a series of ever-more-monstrous enclosures. Enclosure was a big deal if you lived in Scotland in 1800, but most things don’t work that way.</p>
<p>We are eating breakfast. You say “Jam?” and I nod in a particular way, and you pass it to me. If I had nodded in a slightly different way, you would not have passed it. There are rules about nods, which are part of a larger system of conversational rules. You may not “know” the rules about nods, but you reliably orient to them, and interpret them accurately.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_jm7itks" id="extra29_footnoteref8_jm7itks" title="The rules of grammar are also like this. “Adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you’ll sound like a maniac. It’s an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out.”">8</a> As ethnomethodologists, we can find the rules by video recording people eating breakfast, and watching carefully, over and over.</p>
<p>This is a different prototype. Nods may seem trivial, but—I will argue—systems mostly <em>do</em> work that way.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_4s95o21" id="extra29_footnoteref9_4s95o21" title="The ethnomethodological understanding is similar to Wittgenstein’s in Philosophical Investigations—in his discussion of the “builder’s language game” for instance. The builder says “slab! there!” and his assistant puts one there. This is an armchair thought-experiment, however. Ethnomethodology’s extensive empiricism reveals how language, interpretation, cooperation, and improvisation work in much greater detail.">9</a></p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.8">4.8 Patterns of meta-systematicity</h3>
<p>Modules 4.8 and 4.9 teach meta-systematic skills, at a much more sophisticated level than 4.2. We’re no longer pretending, as we did there, that systems work systematically. Instead, we are taking into account the nebulosity of all systems, the nebulosity of the situations in which we use them, and the nebulosity of the system/situation interaction.</p>
<p>4.8 and 4.9 may be the most important part of the curriculum. Unfortunately, it is the part that is least-well understood: by me and, I think, by everyone. Still, there is already much to say; and because the topic is not much investigated, there may be much low-hanging fruit left for the picking.</p>
<p>In retrospect, “<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>” was an attempt. I wrote it in a hurry, and I understand the issues better now, and it looks remarkably lame three years later! However, it does make the key point that we can only ever deploy rationality as a miscellaneous collection of oft-useful tools, rather than The Single Correct Way To Do Everything.</p>
<p>“How To Think” was case-study driven, and that’s probably the best method of investigation. It draws some general conclusions, but inevitably—given the nebulosity of the topic—those can only be nebulous. Insight comes from close examination of specifics (as in ethnomethodology). Finding and analyzing good case studies may be a significant task.</p>
<p>I have also found relevant insights in diverse not-obviously-relevant literatures (some of which I’ve alluded to in this post). Extracting and explaining these is another project. I’ll mention two works here, briefly:</p>
<p>Donald Schön’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B3M3KX8/?tag=meaningness-20">The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals Think In Action↗︎︎</a> examines the interplay of three ways of knowing and acting: technical rationality, non-systematic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge">tacit expertise↗︎︎</a>, and meta-systematic reflection on the first two. The book is based on his close examination of the practice of professionals in five different disciplines, and presents many case studies. He starts from the observation that systematic rationality frequently fails when it meets nebulosity, but he shows how competent professionals can find creative and effective courses of action by drawing on tacit and meta-systematic resources. He observes that problem-finding and problem-formulation are as important as problem-solving, and that all these activities are improvisations in collaborative interaction with concrete, hard-to-characterize circumstances. [<i>Update</i>: Reader <a href="http://www.exampler.com/">Brian Marick↗︎︎</a> recommends Schön’s follow-on book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0022NGE62/?tag=meaningness-20">Educating the Reflective Practitioner↗︎︎</a> over the original; he says it’s clearer and more concise.]</p>
<p>Jean-François Lyotard’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816611734/?tag=meaningness-20">The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge↗︎︎</a> is one of the two root texts for postmodernism. Knowing this, you might not suspect that it was commissioned by the government of Quebec as a report on the influence of information technology on the exact sciences. Written in 1979, it’s astonishingly prophetic about the then-future impact of the internet—but that is not the reason to read it. You might also not suspect that, unlike the voluminous obscurantist blather of later postmodernists, it’s only 70 pages and reasonably clearly written. Lyotard’s main topic is the <a href="#chap153">breakdown of the systematic worldview</a> in the face of nebulosity, and the persistence of multiple, functional, partial systems despite that. He aims for “a politics that would respect both the desire for justice and the desire for the unknown.” This remains unfulfilled, and obstructed not least by the subsequent development of postmodernism—but I think still a worthy goal.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_4.9">4.9 Fluid competence: Creating functional meta-systems</h3>
<p>This module describes systems that recognize nebulosity, and the limitations of their own systematicity, and so are open to continual structural revision as they are illuminated by interaction with nebulous circumstances.</p>
<p>Several of the key figures I mentioned above moved from studying meta-systematic cognition in individuals and task groups to applying their insights to larger social structures. Schön, Kegan, and Brown all pioneered theories of “learning organizations” that continually rethink not just their methods but also their goals.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_jwsnitn" id="extra29_footnoteref10_jwsnitn" title="All three of them worked as management consultants. By the way, the title of this post is—obviously—a riff on Mark McCormack’s book, whose cover is the header image for this page. The revised edition is better. I found it very helpful when I was running a tech startup. What they do teach you at Harvard Business School is mostly financial analysis, which is dead easy for anyone with a math degree. What they don’t teach you are people skills—not always as easy for someone (like myself) with a math degree. Financial analysis is a rational system; people skills are not. Actually, I gather that HBS teaches some “soft skills” nowadays—perhaps partly in response to McCormack’s criticism.">10</a> They ask not just “how do we solve this technical or business problem” but also “what problems are we addressing? are they still the right ones?” and “what are we doing to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BO2ITX2/?tag=meaningness-20">support our staff in developing↗︎︎</a> to address our business more effectively?” Answers to these questions are inevitably improvisational, collaborative, interpretive, and meta-systematic.</p>
<p>I would like to end 4.9 with a section titled “Conjuration: legendary feats of meta-rationality.” I have, actually, many examples in mind; but none of them are in STEM fields. Does this mean meta-systematicity is not, after all, useful in those fields? I don’t think so. Probably, instead, it is because STEM results have to be stated and evaluated in systematic terms. I suspect meta-rational insights produce many STEM breakthroughs, but the resulting journal articles don’t explain the thinking process. (A STEM paper is not supposed to include that.) And so this knowledge—which may be incredibly valuable—is generally lost. The rare discussions by major scientists about how to think—I discussed Feynman’s and Rota’s in “Real Good”—often talk meta-systematically.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_5.0">5.0 The other dimensions</h3>
<p>According to Kegan’s framework, developing a meta-systematic way of being affects every dimension of life. It completely reorganizes your self, your relationship with your self, and your relationships with others. That reorganization manifests in structurally identical ways in your family life, your understanding of ethics, how you plan projects, the way you act at work, and so on.</p>
<p>Kegan says that an epistemological shift—a new way of making meaning—underlies all the rest. He explains the epistemological dimensions of the other stage transitions in detail, but says little about this in 4-to-5 development.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_cppen7q" id="extra29_footnoteref11_cppen7q" title="Kegan says little about stage 5 epistemology in the works of his that I know, anyway. I’ve read only a fraction of his output. His theory is rooted in Piaget’s, which goes only to stage 4 (“formal operations”). Other researchers have proposed theories of stage 5 “post-formal operations,” which Kegan mentions only in passing. Based on only cursory investigation, my impression is that this work isn’t very good, which may be why Kegan decided to pass over the matter in silence.">11</a> This hypothetical curriculum would supply that missing discussion.</p>
<p>I suspect—based only on anecdata—that STEM folks can make the 4-to-5 transition more readily than most others, if the epistemological dimension is brought to the fore. We care about epistemology in a way most people don’t; and it is an epistemological shift that drives the development of other dimensions of being.</p>
<p>Completing the hypothetical 4.9 module should bring the hypothetical STEM-educated student to a stage 5 epistemology.</p>
<p>It would then be helpful to explain the rest of the 4-to-5 shift by analogy with that epistemology. That is, a stage 5 marriage is structurally parallel to a stage 5 STEM research project; and so are stage 5 ethics, religion, management, art, and politics.</p>

<h2 id="extra29_defense">In defense of rationalism</h2>
<p>I have changed my mind.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that rationality is better than irrationality. But now I realize this does need to be said, again, loudly, firmly, and convincingly. It needs to be said in a way that reverses some <a href="#extra14">recent social and cultural trends</a>.</p>
<p>In past, I have <a href="#extra9">criticized</a> rational<em>ism</em>, as misunderstanding rational<em>ity</em>, <a href="#extra8">vociferously</a>. I would like now to advocate and defend it vociferously—versus an apparently rising tide of opposition from multiple directions.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I haven’t got any great ideas about that. However, this post makes some distinctions that might help. Also, I hope I can at least avoid creating extra trouble for rationalism, by explaining that my own criticism of it aims at deploying rationality more effectively.</p>
<p>The “meta-rational” critique takes for granted that rationality is hugely valuable, and that irrational alternatives are mainly harmful. I hope it will help to clarify the distinction between this critique and others.</p>
<p>I will suggest an unusual threefold categorization of movements that oppose rationalism: ignorant, irrelevant, and inscrutable. Or, less flippantly, <dfn>irrational</dfn>, <dfn>anti-rational</dfn>, and <dfn>meta-rational</dfn>.</p>
<p>Effective advocacy requires understanding how the opposition thinks, and speaking in terms they can understand.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_08e4j11" id="extra29_footnoteref2_08e4j11" title="Empirical studies suggest that effective political argument—if the goal is to change minds—depends on talking in terms your opponents understand and care about. This is rare because most political argumentation preaches to the converted. The typical aim is to gain status among your own crowd, not genuinely to persuade opponents.">2</a> Opposition to rationalism is diverse, implying different explanations for different audiences. Early drafts of this post tried to sketch three corresponding approaches to rationalist advocacy. I’ve mostly dropped that, because I’m not sure I have anything novel to say.</p>
<p>I’m explaining the categorization here anyway, because I have several upcoming posts about meta-rationality that will refer to it. I want it to be clear how meta-rationality differs from irrationality and anti-rationality.</p>
<p>And, at the end of the post, I will suggest arguments rationalists can use against meta-rationalist criticism!</p>
<h2 id="extra29_categorizing">Categorizing critiques of rationalism</h2>
<p>The obvious way to categorize opposition is in terms of the content, or “beliefs” of the opponent:</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualist', 'gloss0')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualist</a> religion (Christianity, Islam)</li>
<li><a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monist', 'gloss1')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monist</a> spirituality (Romanticism, <a href="#extra27">New Age woo</a>)</li>
<li>postmodern hyper-relativism</li>
<li>political movements <a href="#extra14">which deny</a> that facts and deliberative procedures are relevant to justice or policy decisions (“tumblr SJW,” “alt-right”)</li>
<li>miscellaneous delusions and faddish moral panics</li>
</ul>
<p>This taxonomy is natural because opponents couch their arguments in terms of content, and so the natural thing is to respond to the content. However, if opponents have irrational reasons for holding their beliefs, rational arguments about facts may not help.</p>
<p>Often, supposed “beliefs” are held as tribal shibboleths rather than as truth-claims. In that case “but it’s not true” is not only irrelevant, it’s taken as an attack on the tribe, rather than as a morally neutral statement about the world.</p>
<p>Effective responses need to take into account the cognitive style of the opponent. Rational arguments, aiming to locate truth in an impersonal reality, may be counterproductive if the opponent’s thinking is communal and relational, locating truth in social belonging.</p>
<p>Cognitive styles could form an alternative categorization of opposition to rationalism. The three stages of <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">adult cognitive development↗︎︎</a> suggest a coarse first cut:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">Pre-systematic↗︎︎</a>, irrational opposition has no understanding of rationality. It is tribal, emotive, and (by definition) unprincipled.</li>
<li><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">Systematic↗︎︎</a>, anti-rational opposition has at least partial understanding of rationality, but rejects it in favor of alternative principles. This category includes systematic theology and knowledgeable Romanticism. These two strands go all the way back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Enlightenment">Counter-Enlightenment↗︎︎</a>, and were the <a href="#chap160">anti-rational bases</a> of the <a href="#chap157">two counter-cultures</a> of the 1960s-80s.</li>
<li><a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">Meta-systematic↗︎︎</a>, meta-rational opposition claims rationalism over-reaches, and focuses on rationality’s limits. This category includes some Continental philosophy (including some “pomo”), and various American lineages of reflective practice, anti-essentialism, ethnomethodology, and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>For fun, and as a mnemonic, I’ll also call these <dfn>ignorant</dfn>, <dfn>irrelevant</dfn>, and <dfn>inscrutable</dfn>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Irrationalism is <em>ignorant</em> of the value of rationality. We should try to educate irrationalists.</li>
<li>Anti-rationalism is <em>irrelevant</em> because it can only repeat geriatric arguments that lost their teeth a century ago. The structure of the argument between rationalism and its systematic opponents is fixed; there are no new challengers. It’s probably not worth bothering with. Perhaps, instead, rationalists should ally with anti-rationalists against irrationalism!<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_088tzbw" id="extra29_footnoteref3_088tzbw" title="For instance, serious Christians are as appalled by pomo nonsense as rationalists are, and for some of the same reasons. Both groups value coherent thought, even if they start from different axioms. Is it worth trying to find common cause? Perhaps movements such as Heterodox Academy can include that effort.">3</a></li>
<li>Meta-rationalism is <em>inscrutable</em> because we meta-rationalists have failed to explain our claims in a way anyone can understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more detailed categorization would be better—but this is a start. And anyway, this post’s main aim is to distinguish the meta-rational critique from the other two.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_distinguishing">Distinguishing ways of thinking from content</h2>
<p>Historically, anti-rational and meta-rational critiques have been somewhat effective, because they are partly right. Consequently, they carry considerable prestige. People who are cognitively equipped to understand rational arguments are also capable of recognizing the force of these critiques, so they still sometimes work. They can deter some people who might otherwise adopt rationalism. They can undercut confidence or even convert committed rationalists. And, they can do great damage even when wielded by irrationalists who don’t understand them.</p>
<p>Irrationalists often dismiss valid rational arguments using phrases taken from anti-rational or meta-rational movements. Anyone can parrot a previously-successful argument. When irrationalists brandish those without comprehension, it doesn’t help to explain the errors and limits of the critiques they’ve borrowed from.</p>
<p>It is easy enough for irrationalists to learn to imitate linguistic style. That reduces sophisticated critiques to buzzphrases, arguments repeated by rote, and grossly simplified conceptual structures. The ignorant may then sound like they understand lines of reasoning that they don’t.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_ctee1xp" id="extra29_footnoteref4_ctee1xp" title="“Bayes! Bayes! Bayes!” is a rationalist equivalent: parroting sacred jargon without having thought through the implications, and sometimes even without understanding the concepts named. Some beginners adopt rationalist language mainly as a tribal membership signal; most grow out of it.">4</a> You may be tempted to address them at the level of that reasoning; but that is useless if they can’t follow systematic arguments. By definition, irrationalists can’t understand why they are wrong.</p>
<p>For effective persuasion, it’s important to address the interlocutor’s type of reasoning, more than the argument itself. Reasoning becomes apparent only when an argument is probed. Does the response advert to tribal defense, virtuous feelings, and “beliefs” no one actually holds? (Then their irrationalism is ignorant.) Or to chains of justification rooted in abstract, ultimate principles? (Then their anti-rationalism is irrelevant.) Or to system-boundary nebulosity? (Then their meta-rationalism is inscrutable.)</p>
<p>The American “right” mimics the language of systematic theology, and selectively invokes a handful of religious concepts; but few American Christians know the basic tenets of their faith. If someone rants against homosexuality and invokes “Biblical principles” but can’t explain their own sect’s take on the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justification_(theology)#Comparison_of_traditions">justification and sanctification↗︎︎</a>, they are irrational, not anti-rational. The real basis of their opposition is tribal, emotional, and self-interested, not religious.</p>
<p>It was only when I learned to set aside the pious “divine law” nonsense mouthed by social conservatives that <a href="#extra15_large">I came to understand</a> the underlying, genuine basis of their seemingly-irrational “moral” concerns—and to sympathize with them.</p>
<p>American Millennial “leftists” ape the jargon of poststructuralism, which even their professors mostly can’t understand. At its best, poststructuralism was a meta-rational movement. Most current advocates misunderstand it as showing that claims to authoritative knowledge, by science and rationality, are <em>nothing more</em> than propaganda on behalf of oppressors. If someone rants against capitalism and invokes Foucault, but can’t explain how his archaeological method relates to Saussurean structuralism and existential phenomenology, they are irrational, not meta-rational. The real basis of their opposition is tribal, emotional, and self-interested, not poststructuralist.</p>
<p>It was only when I learned to set aside the pious “structural oppression” nonsense mouthed by campus activists that I came to understand the underlying, genuine basis of their seemingly-irrational “moral” concerns—and to sympathize with them.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_putup">Put up or shut up</h2>

<p>Meta-rationality shouldn’t be inscrutable.</p>
<p>Meta-rationalists have been promising a coherent account of meaning for nearly a century. Somehow, we’ve never delivered, although we think we understand it quite well. It’s time we put up or shut up.</p>
<p>This is now my Quest: to <a href="#extra16">make meta-rationality accessible</a>.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_1lmotbj" id="extra29_footnoteref5_1lmotbj" title="That’s my Quest this week, anyway. I wouldn’t want to make an eternalistic mission out of it. Anyway, I inevitably get distracted by side-quests. “To sail the Sea of Meaningness, first must you raise the Complete Ship from the Swamp of Nebulosity!” “Uh, ok, I guess I’ll go and try…” “Do, or Do Not! There is no Try.” [Puts on engineer hat, orders block, tackle, winch and cable from Amazon] Did you know that “Dagobah” is the Chinese name for a Tibetan-style temple? Lucas named the planet that for a reason.">5</a></p>
<p>Why has no one done this before? Three reasons, maybe:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transition from rationality to meta-rationality involves an irreversible cognitive flip, after which it seems too obvious to explain.</li>
<li>Rationalists are afflicted with a frustrating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)">Dunning-Kruger↗︎︎</a> illusion: they cannot understand that there is something they cannot understand.</li>
<li>Meta-rationalists are prone to elitist in-group superiority-signaling.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extra29_flip">The cognitive flip</h3>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first"><img alt="Obscure image of a Dalmatian" height="362" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/dalmatian_560x362.gif" title="Obscure image of a Dalmatian" width="560"/></figure>
<p>Many recall the transition from rationalism to meta-rationalism as a sudden blinding moment of illumination. It’s like the famous blotchy figure above: once you have <em>seen</em> its meaning, you <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/10-things-you-cant-unsee-and-what-that-says-about-your-brain/361335/">can never unsee it↗︎︎</a> again. After you <em>get</em> meta-rationality, you see the world differently. You see meanings rationalism cannot—and you can never go back.</p>
<p>This is probably an illusion of memory. The transition occurs only after years of accumulating bits of insight into the relationship between <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss6" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss6')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form.

<p>The graph above is by <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/author/sarahperry/">Sarah Perry↗︎︎</a>, from a <a href="http://ribbonfarm.teachable.com/p/the-art-of-longform">writing course↗︎︎</a> she co-taught. “Compression speed,” on the vertical axis, is an informal measure of the rate at which you find new insight. It peaks when a bunch of puzzle-pieces you’ve accumulated fall together into a pattern. This is tremendously exciting, and is the best time to communicate the insight—because your excitement is contagious! Once you’ve fully understood something, there’s nothing new to learn, and writing about it will bore your readers as well as you.</p>
<p>I realized only recently, gradually, as I was attempting to write an overview, that no one ever seems to have bothered to explain meta-rationality clearly. Somehow I had never noticed that!</p>
<p>If it’s obvious, it seems not worth explaining; anyone who doesn’t get it must just be an idiot. Anyway, it’s all perfectly straightforward, so you need hardly any explanation, right?</p>
<p>But having begun to try, I’ve found that an explanation is enormously complex. Reading it will be laborious; writing it, more so. Perhaps that is why meta-rationalists are often unhelpful. We are lazy, as well as arrogant.</p>
<p>Explaining something supposedly well-understood is more like writing a textbook than a blog post, thesis, or journal article. When you write a textbook—I am told—you discover there are many aspects of your field you thought you understood, but, actually, you don’t. Or, rather, you had a good enough understanding to <em>use</em> the concepts, but not good enough to <em>explain</em> them. You have been exploiting patterns that let you skate over conceptual nebulosity—but how does <em>that</em> work? You need to build a rigorous logical reconstruction of the foundations of your field.</p>
<p>That project is fun in a quite different way from explaining new object-level insights as they bubble up. (Well, I <em>hope</em> it’s fun!)</p>
<h3 id="extra29_dunning">Dunning-Kruger</h3>
<p>Rationalists may find it difficult to communicate with irrationalists, to explain to them what they are doing wrong in terms they can understand. It’s frustrating. Irrationalism seems like willful stupidity once you see the better alternative. “Look, this is just dumb! The reasons you give make no sense! Why can’t you just see that the evidence, and basic principles of reasoning, show your beliefs are totally wrong?” It’s hard to know where to start sorting out their confusion. It certainly doesn’t help to make rational arguments to people who can’t understand rationality and don’t respect it.</p>
<p>Just as irrationalists can’t understand the rationalist critique, rationalists can’t understand the meta-rational critique. That is frustrating for meta-rationalists, in just the same way. “Look, this is just dumb! The principles you are invoking are irrelevant here! Why can’t you see that the energetic texture of the situation, and basic methods of meta-systematicity, show you are going at it totally wrong?” It’s hard to know where to start sorting out their confusion. It certainly doesn’t help to make meta-rational arguments to people who can’t understand meta-rationality and don’t respect it.</p>
<p>In both cases, incomprehension is not because people are stupid, but because ways of reasoning haven’t been explained in terms they can yet follow.</p>
<p>However, virtually everyone <em>can</em> understand <em>some</em> simple rational reasoning. And almost everyone with a decent grounding in rationality <em>can</em> also understand some simple meta-rational reasoning. (See “<a href="#extra13">A first lesson in meta-rationality</a>.”) So it should be possible to build a continuous, <a href="#extra12">step-by-step bridge</a> from rationality to meta-rationality, just as the STEM curriculum provides a step-by-step bridge from pre-rational thinking to rationality.</p>
<p>Intellectual change occurs when someone points out a better way—not from explaining why your current paradigm is defective. So I intend to turn from griping about rationalism’s errors to presenting a better alternative. That’s more difficult, but I hope it will be more useful.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_signaling">Elite signaling</h3>
<p>Most advocates of meta-rationality have gone out of their way to anti-explain it. This deliberate obscurantism is mostly sneery in-group elitism. Dense jargon and subtle, poorly-explained concepts are forbidding palisades against club entry. Fighting your way up does demonstrate intelligence and grit, but meta-rational skills are too valuable to allow them be monopolized by intellectual elites. Especially because those elites have mainly been satisfied to entertain themselves with clever in-jokes and displays of content-free virtuosity, instead of creating anything useful.</p>
<p>The bridge to meta-rationality must be supportive and respectful of participants whatever their level of understanding. It must avoid put-downs, hazing, shibboleths, and smug IQ-signaling. This is not particularly easy; it goes against the natural human tendency to create tribal in-groups.</p>
<div id="extra29_foucault_video"><figure class="ctrimg"><div class="youtube_outer_wrapper"><div class="youtube_inner_wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="youtube" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yvwhEIhv3N0?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div></div></figure></div>
<p>The plainspoken American philosopher John Searle was a friend of Michel Foucault, who had important meta-rational insights. He asked Foucault why his writing was so incomprehensible, given that in person he spoke perfectly clearly. Foucault said that in France, no one would take you seriously as a philosopher if they could understand you, so you had to pad your writing with a lot of nonsensical verbiage.</p>
<p>This was a huge moral failure. If the poststructuralists had written clearly, the world might be quite different now, and for the better. By the 1970s, they had acquired enough personal power, prestige, and position that they could have safely defied, and replaced, French academic conventions.</p>
<p>Their legacy is mainly pernicious: they are mis-taken as underwriting irrational tribalism that has done great damage in universities, and has started to spill out into the real world. Their valid insights are not widely understood, and little-used. And, they are little built-upon: if they had written clearly, we might have had much greater progress in meta-rational epistemology over the past few decades.</p>
<p>Instead, the voluminous, blatantly self-interested and irrational “pomo” blather spouted by their academic heirs discredits meta-rationality in the eyes of sensible people.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_responding">Responding to inscrutable critiques</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, I’m not sure I have anything useful to say about defending rationalism against irrationalism or anti-rationalism. However, I want to suggest two ways to defend rationalism against meta-rational criticism.</p>
<p>The first points out that that an inscrutable argument is highly likely to be nonsense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If</em> you have anything valid to say—which we do not concede—you need to explain it in a way more people can understand. You have completely failed to even try to do that! This strongly suggests that you <em>don’t</em> have anything to say, but are just spewing meaningless jargon as part of a career-enhancing academic ritual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the subjective prior probability that a “meta-rational” argument has any bite should be very low. (Bayes!)</p>
<p>Of course, one can never be certain, and should always consider the consequences of alternative outcomes. (Decision theory!) So a second response is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possibly you are right that rationalism isn’t The Answer, but it’s extraordinarily useful and we can’t do without it. At the moment, it’s more important to defend rationalism against irrational attacks than to point out possible, obscure defects. “Meta-rational” criticism has negative expected utility, due to strengthening irrational forces.</p>

<p>Here I aim to diagnose these three ailments, and to offer remedies.

<!--break-->
<p>I’ll explain those shortly, but before diving in, a quick summary—which may make sense only for readers who are already familiar with both ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Much of the appeal of politics nowadays is as a prolific source of definite meanings, in <a href="#chap173">an era</a> in which those seem scarce. Eternalism <a href="#chap39">hallucinates meaning</a> where there is none. Contemporary politics, afflicted with eternalism, is overloaded with irrelevant and illusory meanings.</p>
<p>Following Kegan’s scheme, eternalism in politics can be divided into <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">tribal↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">systematic↗︎︎</a> forms. These are stages 3 and 4 in his developmental framework. They correspond to the first two paragraphs at the top of this page. The third paragraph expresses nihilistic rejection of politics, which is typical of stage 4.5. The complete stance avoids the errors of both eternalism and nihilism. It relates to stage 5; and in the social realm, it manifests as the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss3')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance. It incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism, recognizing that meaningness is always both patterned and nebulous. Likewise, the fluid mode acknowledges structures of meaning without attempting rigid foundations. Its values are collaboration, creativity, improvisation, intimacy, disposability, aesthetics, and spiritual depth through community participation. [Click for details.]">fluid mode</a>.</p>
<p>I discuss these in turn below, along with suggestions for how we can move beyond unproductive tribal and systematic political conflicts.</p>
<p>First, a discussion of the psychology of political commitment. (If you have followed my previous writing closely, this will mostly be familiar, so you may want skim, or <a href="#extra29_tribal">skip over it</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="extra29_bases">The bases of political cognition</h2>
<p>The “standard theory” of democratic politics goes something like this.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_ewclg99" id="extra29_footnoteref1_ewclg99" title="It may be that no one believes this “standard” theory. It’s roughly what’s taught in a civics class, so everyone’s discourse orients to it, even though it may not reflect any reality.">1</a> Political ideologies are coherent <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systems', 'gloss4')" title="“Systems,” in this book, are conceptual, methodological, and institutional structures that make claims about meaningness.  These include, for instance, religions, philosophies, political ideologies, and psychological frameworks. A system includes a structure of justification, which explains why you should believe its claims, and typically grounds in an eternal ordering principle. I contrast systems with stances, which are much simpler attitudes toward meaningness. [Click for details.]">systems</a> of beliefs about government, based on fundamental moral principles. Everyone commits to one ideology, and its beliefs, based on its principles aligning with their moral values. The ideologies contradict each other’s beliefs, and so people fight about which beliefs are correct. They organize political parties to champion their ideology. From an ideology’s principles, you can figure out what your position on specific policy issues should be.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_yl31pyf" id="extra29_footnoteref2_yl31pyf" title="This folk theory of political conflict is obviously derived from the folk theory of religious conviction. That theory is also wrong, for the same reasons.">2</a></p>
<p>This is mostly wrong.</p>
<ul class="tight_list">
<li>Most people have only a vague understanding of political ideology, and don’t care much about it. They don’t care about ideology because they don’t actually care about government, or about policy.</li>
<li>To the extent that voters care about government, they mostly just want it to act to benefit people like themselves.</li>
<li>People <em>do</em> care about politics—but current politics is mostly <a href="#chap162">not about government</a>. It is about <a href="#chap167_awful">tribal identity and personal status</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="extra29_dont-care">Most voters actively don’t-care about government policy</h3>
<p>Surveys consistently show that voters are astonishingly ignorant of basic facts about how their system of government is organized, about current policy questions, and about the policy positions of candidates and parties. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly a third of American voters think that the Marxist slogan “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need” appears in the Constitution. About as many are incapable of naming even one of the three branches of the United States government. Fewer than a quarter know who their senators are, and only half are aware that their state has two of them.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_6stexbi" id="extra29_footnoteref3_6stexbi" title="Caleb Crain, “The case against democracy.”">3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And similarly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most commonly known fact about George H. W. Bush’s opinions while he was president was that he hated broccoli. During the 1992 presidential campaign, 86 percent of the public knew that the Bushes’ dog was named Millie, yet only 15 percent knew that both presidential candidates supported the death penalty. Judge Wapner, host of the reality-TV series “The People’s Court,” was identified by more people than were Chief Justices Burger or Rehnquist. More people knew who John Lennon was than Karl Marx, and Bill Cosby than either of their U.S. Senators.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_e8utnuy" id="extra29_footnoteref4_e8utnuy" title="Michael Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter, What Americans Know about Politics and Why it Matters, p. 101. Quote lightly edited for clarity. TL;DR: in many cases, shockingly little; although (surprise!) voters from socially dominant demographic categories know more. Perhaps more interestingly, they found that better-informed voters are less likely to vote for their tribal interest, and more likely to favor policies of general benefit. There’s an extended summary of the book here.">4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This might lead to the depressing conclusion that voters are extraordinarily stupid. That would be a mistake, though. The reason people don’t know about government is that they don’t care about it. It is boring, and they believe they shouldn’t <em>have</em> to care about it. It should just work, delivered as a reliable public service like electricity. No one knows how electricity works, because there’s no reason to bother.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IDY9IM/?tag=meaningness-20">Stealth Democracy: Americans’ Beliefs About How Government Should Work↗︎︎</a> finds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the prevailing view that people want greater involvement in politics, <strong>most citizens do not care about most policies and therefore are content to turn over decision-making authority to someone else</strong>. People’s wish for the political system is that decision makers be empathetic and, especially, non-self-interested, not that they be responsive and accountable to the people’s largely nonexistent policy preferences or, even worse, that the people be obligated to participate directly in decision making.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_s2ikep1" id="extra29_footnoteref5_s2ikep1" title="Quote is from the blurb, rather than the book itself. Emphasis added.">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="extra29_interests">Most people vote for their perceived tribal interests</h3>
<p>As I discussed in my page on the <a href="#chap167">culture war</a>, political scientists Jason Weeden and Robert Kurzban found that differing pragmatic interests explain Americans’ political opinions better than differing ideological or moral “values.” (They summarize this research in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KUCTP2C/?tag=meaningness-20">The Hidden Agenda of the Political Mind: How Self-Interest Shapes Our Opinions and Why We Won’t Admit It↗︎︎</a>.) Ideology dresses up naked self-interest in modest, morally attractive and conceptually elegant outfits. Everyone advocates policies that would favor people like themselves—often at the expense of many or most other people—and then rationalize their views in terms of high-sounding universal principles. This is largely unconscious.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_9q80eky" id="extra29_footnoteref6_9q80eky" title="One should be skeptical, at first, about any claims about unconscious psychological processes—because how could we know? Weeden and Kurzban correlate survey data on people’s stated political values, their socioeconomic circumstances, and their stated policy preferences. They find higher correlations between socioeconomic factors and policy preferences than between political ideology and policy preferences.">6</a></p>
<p>In a representative democracy, you vote for candidates, not policies. Most people choose a candidate who seems to be from their tribe, or at least empathizes with their tribe, and who will therefore use government to promote the interests of the tribe. They don’t want to have to know how he or she will go about doing that.</p>
<p>To the extent that they keep track of policy issues, they select a handful that are litmus tests for “will this person advance the interests of my tribe?” Those particular policies need not particularly benefit the tribe; the issues they address might be entirely symbolic. They only need to be a reliable indicator of tribal affiliation.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_stances">Stances trump systems</h3>
<p>Although most people don’t care much about policy, they do care passionately about politics. For many, politics serves as a main source of meaning in life—like religion, ethics, or psychology.</p>

<p>This page applies the same method to eternalism and nihilism. Dropping those might eliminate much political confusion, and along with it much unnecessary political conflict.</p>
<p>This is not a plea for centrism, compromise, civility, or well-meaning tolerance. (I tend to favor those, but that is not the point here.) Political conflict cannot be ended by “finding the truth somewhere in-between.” Partly that’s because it involves conflicts of pragmatic interest; income redistribution benefits some and harms others, and no analysis in terms of meanings or values can change that. But also because both sides are afflicted by the <em>same</em> confused stances. The truth is <a href="#chap13">not in-between</a>; it’s somewhere entirely different: in a complete stance.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_stages">Stages of emotional, cognitive, and moral development</h3>
<p>Kegan describes <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/">three stages of adult development↗︎︎</a>, numbered 3, 4, and 5. We could call them <dfn>tribal</dfn> (stage 3), <dfn>systematic</dfn> (stage 4), and <dfn>fluid</dfn> (stage 5). Each is a complete, consistent way of being, with a characteristic way of approaching relationships, the nature of one’s self, the way one thinks in general, and ethical thinking in particular. Below, I apply this scheme to political thinking.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_h5ha5ce" id="extra29_footnoteref8_h5ha5ce" title="This political application is purely speculative. Kegan’s work is based on extensive empirical study; I’m just waving my hands.">8</a></p>
<p>These stages are not ideologies, or sets of values. They have no content; they are about form. They are <em>ways</em> one thinks and feels, not <em>what</em> one thinks and feels.</p>
<p>The stages are not alternatives that different people adopt according to innate preferences, or due to family or peer-group influence. They are necessarily-sequential steps in personal growth. People who are at a particular stage <em>cannot think or feel</em> in the ways characteristic of later stages. They actually cannot understand explanations given in a later stage’s framework. (And, they mostly cannot understand that they do not understand them.) On the other hand, anyone at a later stage can accurately describe how someone at an earlier stage would think about an issue.</p>
<p>Stage 3 is about <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#communal">identifying with one’s community↗︎︎</a>. What is good for the tribe is good, period. (This is an eternalistic statement.)</p>
<p>Communal ethics seek harmony within a homogeneous social group. That is maintained by empathically monitoring others’ needs and aligning your intentions toward them. You should obey community taboos and shibboleths, even when they are unjustified and senseless. Violating them upsets people, which is not nice. Living up to what other members expect from you to is good by definition.</p>
<p>For stage 3, conflict within the tribe is anathema, but hostility to outsiders is heroic—because they reject the <a href="#chap167_myths">sacred myths</a> of the tribe, which violates harmony.</p>
<p>Stage 4 is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">about systems↗︎︎</a>. In political terms, it is ideological, whereas stage 3 hasn’t yet developed the cognitive capacity to evaluate ideological claims. It understands formal structures, principles, and roles. It operates competently in a rule-driven social organization, such as a corporation or governmental body. These are full of asymmetrical, artificial relationships with specific responsibilities. (A tribal community, by contrast, recognizes only conventional family roles; plus one’s loose, unbounded, reciprocal responsibility to support the collective, and right to be supported by it.) For stage 4, a system is ethical if it treats people impartially: based on rights, responsibilities, principles, and procedures, not personal relationships.</p>
<p>Stage 4 takes <em>one</em> system as correct. It sees principles as absolute truths. If two systems conflict, one must be wrong. That makes it, too, an eternalistic view.</p>
<p>Development beyond stage 4 is driven by seeing contradictions within and between systems. At some point you realize that all principles are somewhat arbitrary or relative. There is no ultimately true foundation on which a correct system can be built. It’s not just that we don’t yet know what the absolute truth is; it is that there <em>cannot be</em> one.</p>
<p>This uncomfortable midpoint of the stage 4 to 5 transition is “<a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#4.5">stage 4.5↗︎︎</a>.” It’s common here to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss21" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'commit', 'gloss21')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up. [Click for details.]">commit</a> to explicit nihilism. Understanding that there is no ultimate meaning, one comes to the wrong conclusion that there are no meanings at all.</p>
<p>Eventually, you notice that meanings continue to operate quite well despite their lack of ultimate foundations. Systems re-emerge as transparent forms. You no longer see <em>by means of</em> systems, but can <em>see through</em> systems as fluid constructions that most people mis-take as solid. Stage 5 is <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">meta-systematic↗︎︎</a>: it can hold contradictions between systems comfortably while respecting the specific functioning and justification-structure of each. It relativizes all ideologies as tools rather than truths.</p>
<p>Stage 5 commits to the complete stance: it recognizes both the nebulosity and the patterns of systems, and so avoids both eternalism and nihilism.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_tribal">Deflating tribal drama</h2>
<p>For stage 3 tribal participants, political conflict is an endless fount of meaning. It offers simple, dramatic narratives, colorful characters, nail-biting battles of Good and Evil, and exciting opportunities for personal heroism and tribal solidarity. These fairy stories and soap operas appear highly meaningful, but are <a href="#chap39">superimposed</a>, with little basis in reality.</p>
<p>Football, Hollywood celebrities’ love lives, and politics are interchangeable entertainments for many. The appeal of sports and gossip also lies in fictional, superimposed dramas of emotional, relational, tribal conflict. That is benign; not so for politics, unfortunately.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_curiosity">Curiosity and realism</h3>
<p>Moving from eternalism <a href="#chap90">to the complete stance</a> starts by deflating imaginary dramas and stripping away fake meanings. Political conflict is inevitable, but inter-tribal demonization is not. Culture warring over symbols is not.</p>
<p>Politics minus eternalism leaves practical conflicts, which are inevitable, because people are diverse. However, practical solutions are usually possible—after dissolving eternalist absolutisms, which make compromise look morally wrong.</p>
<p>Minus overlaid meanings, reality looks dull, seen from the eternalistic standpoint. From a distance, the complete stance seems boring, <a href="#chap90_already">because it is obviously right</a>; and unappealing, because it doesn’t make <a href="#chap31">attractive (but false) promises</a>, like confused stances do. It does not offer <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss22" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Cosmic Plan', 'gloss22')" title="I use “Cosmic Plan” to refer to any idea of an ultimate source of meaning, such as God, the Absolute, destiny, Reason, highest consciousness, or whatever.  All such ideas are inherently eternalistic. [Click for details.]">The Ultimate Answer To Everything</a>. It only removes obstacles to seeing meanings accurately.</p>
<p>Politics <em>should</em> look dull to eternalists. Its legitimate function is to make decisions about policy issues, like highway maintenance, bank regulation, and cybersecurity. These are severely boring topics—unless you have the curiosity to dive into their intricate details. (Then they become fascinating—of their own accord, without imaginary dramas added.)</p>
<p>Open-ended curiosity is an antidote to both eternalism and nihilism, and <a href="/curiosity">a key aspect↗︎︎</a> of the complete stance. When it comes to highway maintenance, bank regulation, and cybersecurity, most people aren’t curious; and there is no reason they should be. But that does imply they shouldn’t be interested in politics.</p>
<p>“Closed-ended” curiosity means seeking the answer to a specific question, within a particular framework. That is characteristic of stage 4 systematic eternalism. Open-ended curiosity requires active enjoyment of nebulosity. It has no beef with meaninglessness, bafflement, and un-knowing. That generosity allows meaning to emerge spontaneously, instead of imposing it. How often in a political discussion do you hear “I don’t know; this is puzzling”? Mostly I hear “That just <em>proves</em> that the correct answer is…!”</p>
<p>Realism is another antidote to both eternalism and nihilism. “Boring” policy topics particularly demand it. Speculative fantasies about cybersecurity are running rife at the moment, and are spectacularly unhelpful.</p>
<p>Everyone feels qualified to have political opinions without knowing anything about policy issues. Everyone feels justified in fighting the culture war without understanding its basis or function. This is stupid, harmful, and morally wrong, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is actively encouraged by popular morality in Western democracies. “You ought to develop an informed opinion about political issues so you can participate effectively in democracy” was a powerfully correct social norm at one time. “Informed” meant understanding the policy issues. That part of the norm has fallen away. Perhaps increasing social, economic, and technological complexity has made that inevitable. It was feasible for voters to understand most policy issues back in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss23" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'systematic era', 'gloss23')" title="The systematic mode attempts to justify all meanings with some explanatory structure. Typically, this system builds on a foundational eternal ordering principle. The systematic mode is eternalistic, claiming to offer absolute certainty, understanding, and control. In the late twentieth century, it became clear that this is impossible, and the systematic mode failed. [Click for details.]">systematic era</a>; it is not now. “Informed” opinion, if the adjective is remembered at all, means you can regurgitate a soundbite or factoid you saw on the news last night. It rarely involves structural understanding.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_restoring">Restoring alternative sources of meaning</h3>
<p>The countercultures <a href="#chap157_monist_monist">merged religion, ethics, and politics</a>. That reduced all three to vague, homogenous, weaksauce pablum. Each of these distinct domains of meaning lost its specificity <a href="#chap157_values">and its bite</a>. That is comfortable—and it was by offering comfort that the countercultures could create mass movements.</p>
<p>But it has also left a vacuum of meaningfulness. So, layers of fictional meaning got added to politics in order to make it do the work ethics and religion used to. The slogans “social justice” and “family values” were pressed into service as ill-suited and inadequate substitutes for morality and religion. Nearly everyone agrees that society should be just, and should honor and support families. Almost no one is against either, which makes them meaningless if taken at face value. As political slogans, they act instead as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Applause_light">applause lights↗︎︎</a> for the whole of the left and right political agendas, respectively.</p>
<p>It is hard to let go of imaginary meanings without better alternatives. Restoring religion and ethics to their proper roles as distinctive sources of value would help. (It would be the right thing for their own sakes as well!)</p>
<p>In the case of religion, both countercultures <a href="#chap160_subjective">merged many dissimilar traditions</a> into the two generic New Age and Christian Conservative brands, neither of which had much content. (Buddhism, which happens to be my religion, got <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/12/31/one-dharma-whose/">caught up in this↗︎︎</a>, and <a href="https://vividness.live/2011/06/10/nice-buddhism/">was reduced to↗︎︎</a> “it’s nice to be nice.”)</p>
<p>I would like religious leaders to proclaim, once again, that different religions, denominations, and sects are importantly different. That doesn’t have to imply sectarian conflict—“different” doesn’t mean “ours is the Only True Way”—but even that might be better than “all religions teach the same truth.” And, in a country that guarantees religious freedom, sectarian animosity would be preferable to the political culture war.</p>
<p>Kegan was particularly concerned with ethics. He observed that adult cognitive development in general, and ethical development in particular, requires social and cultural support. The transition from stage 3 to stage 4 ethics is difficult to accomplish solo. Joining a well-functioning social system that demonstrates systematic ethics in action is hugely helpful. Unfortunately, Western societies have allowed this “bridge” to <a href="#extra12_3-to-4">fall into disrepair</a>, making getting to stage 4 is harder than it should be. Repairing the bridge would be a major step toward defusing the tribal culture war.</p>
<p>It would also help to reinforce additional sources of meaning that have been particularly undercut by <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss24" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'atomization', 'gloss24')" title="The atomized mode of relating to meaningness abandons coherence, but provides access to all of globalized culture via the internet.

<p>Many political scientists have suggested, uneasily, that people who don’t understand politics <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy">shouldn’t be allowed↗︎︎</a> to vote. The logic of this is inescapable, but there are strong obvious objections to putting it into practice—even in principle. My next post will suggest a way to keep politically uninformed, cognitively tribal people from affecting policy decisions, without depriving them of a vote.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_systems">Looking beyond political systems</h2>
<p>A more sophisticated understanding of politics concerns systems: institutions, principles, and rule-governed procedures. Eternalism at stage 4 is the stance that there are <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss26" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ultimately', 'gloss26')" title="“Ultimate” and “ultimately” are words that often turn up in discussions of meaningness. They can be legitimate, but are often advertising hype, obfuscation, or intimidation. [Click for details.]">ultimately</a> correct institutions, principles, and rules. Its fantasy is that there <a href="#chap51">must be</a> some <a href="#chap75">cosmically true system of government</a>, and if only we adopted it, it would solve most social problems.</p>
<p>The <a href="#chap155">1960s-80s countercultures</a> were <a href="#chap156">originally systematic</a>. However, it is hard to hold systems together without the glue of rationality, which both countercultures <a href="#chap160">rejected</a>. They tried to find alternative adhesives, and mostly failed. As a result, the culture war that <a href="#chap167">is their legacy</a> is mainly symbolic, mythic, and emotive; i.e., tribal.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’re now living in the atomized era. That has not only dissolved all coherence, it renders the countercultures senseless because they are archaic relics left over from two modes back. Their waterlogged wrecks are breaking up and sinking into the contemporary sea of atomized meanings.</p>
<p>For those who have a <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#systematic">systematic worldview↗︎︎</a>, a main appeal of culture warring is that political ideology is a source of coherent, structured meanings, which are socially validated as important. In the atomized era, conceptual coherence has become precious and scarce, outside of technical disciplines.</p>
<p>For non-technical people making the 3-to-4 transition, by gradually developing the ability to think systematically, working through the logic of a political ideology can be a lifeline of meaningfulness. Testing one’s arguments in debate is a training ground for rational thought. One can be proud of rising above the meaningless chaotic noise of tribal political discord, and of gaining a seeming understanding of how the world really works, and how society really should be organized.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although it is more sophisticated, systematic political eternalism is as mistaken as the tribal version. Two reasons: there is no correct political system, and political reasoning from first principles doesn’t work.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_no-correct">There is no correct political system</h3>
<p>Arguing about which tidy, rational system is correct—in the abstract—is nearly as irrelevant and counterproductive as arguing about which tribe is correct. Politics doesn’t run on tidy rational systems. And never did—despite the pretensions of the systematic era—and never could. (I’ll explain why briefly below, and in more detail later in the book.)</p>
<p>Systematic, “<a href="#chap63">rational</a>” reasoning about political structures usually ends up in a simplistic, totalizing vision that is logically elegant but ignores obvious practicalities, and which would be a disaster if implemented. Communism, anarchism, and idealized laissez-faire capitalism are typical examples. These systems are also all highly moralistic (whereas the fluid mode recognizes the nebulosity of ethics, and its only-partial coupling with politics, and so can be more pragmatic).</p>
<p>Geeky details of government structure can be important, and structural tinkering may be worthwhile. However, the idea that wholesale replacement with idealized first-principles alternatives would solve most problems is a fantasy. It proved catastrophic in many countries during the twentieth century.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_principles">Political reasoning from first principles doesn’t work</h3>
<p>Deductive reasoning is typical of stage 4 political thinking. “This principle implies that such-and-such a policy would have that outcome, which would be morally right; therefore it is the correct policy.”</p>
<p>The appeal of deductive reasoning is the <a href="#chap32">promise of certainty</a>. If you have found the <em>right</em> political system, and you follow valid rules of logic, you will know for sure what the correct policies are. Also, your position will be unassailable, and you can win all political arguments (so long as your opponents are even vaguely rational). Unfortunately, this is completely delusional.</p>
<p>Reasoning from first principles usually obscures the relevant issues in pragmatic policy problems. Those are typically nebulous: hideously complex, replete with messy practical specifics, and dependent on constantly-changing circumstances. Their effects are highly uncertain ahead of time, difficult to identify after the fact, and of ambiguous value since they benefit some people and hurt others. Deductive logic—which proceeds from clear-cut certainty to clear-cut certainty—fails in the face of such nebulosity.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_lynueah" id="extra29_footnoteref9_lynueah" title="A future page of Meaningness will explain nebulosity’s thrashing of logic in mind-numbing technical detail, for the sake of a certain class of math geeks. For the sake of religious Bayesians, I should mention that it also thrashes probabilistic inference. Uncertainty is not the problem; it is ambiguity.">9</a></p>
<p>Further, in political conflicts, fundamental principles are usually multiple and disagree. If there was only one, or they all pointed in same direction, one policy would be obviously the right thing and people would just do it and there would be no controversy. Stage 4 reasoning has limited resources for dealing with conflicting principles. (Stage 5 has more. Relatedly, stage 5 recognizes, as neither 3 nor 4 consistently does, that your political opponents are not motivated by uncommon malice or stupidity.)</p>
<p>Most policy issues must be addressed empirically, not deductively. Would a Basic Guaranteed Income scheme lead to greater or lesser employment? Would legalizing heroin lead to an increase or decrease in fatal overdoses? Will legalizing gay marriage be good or bad for children of same-sex couples? There is no way to reason these questions out. The only way to get answers is to do experiments and see what happens.</p>
<p>Systematic people are often nearly as ignorant about policy issues as tribal ones are—but for a completely different reason. Tribal people simply find government uninteresting. Systematic people choose ignorance because facts—and especially uncertain facts—wreck first-principles reasoning, and frequently contradict simplistic implications of eternalistic systems.</p>
<p>Michael Huemer, recommending that most people <a href="http://studiahumana.com/pliki/wydania/In%20Praise%20of%20Passivity.pdf">stay out of politics↗︎︎</a>, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that most people who expend a great deal of effort promoting political causes expend very little effort attempting to make sure their beliefs are correct. They tend to hold very strong beliefs that they are very reluctant to reconsider. When presented with new information conflicting with their existing beliefs, these individuals are much more likely to react with anger, as one under attack, than with gratitude…. The evidence thus suggests that politically committed people are motivated more by a desire for a sense of promoting political ideals than by a desire for those ideals themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Productive political debate argues concrete practicalities, not systems or values. In “<a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/02/17/the-seven-habits-of-highly-depolarizing-people/">The Seven Habits of Highly Depolarizing People↗︎︎</a>,” which points toward a stage 5 understanding of politics, David Blankenhorn recommends—among other excellent advice—doubting your convictions, and sticking to specifics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because generalization is both an ally and a frequent indicator of polarization, highly depolarizing people tend to be connoisseurs of the specific. This dedication to specificity can express itself in at least four important ways. The first is a persistent skepticism about categories. The second is to consider each issue separately and on its own terms, as opposed to assuming the validity of a governing ideological framework, such as “conservatism” or “liberalism.” The third shifts the argument away from abstract, often philosophically charged questions, toward specific empirical ones. The fourth is to rely on inductive reasoning, which tries to build conclusions from the bottom up by accumulating specific data points, over deductive reasoning, which tries to build conclusions from the top down by exploring the implications of true general premises or statements.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_ej4tiu3" id="extra29_footnoteref10_ej4tiu3" title="Blankenhorn quote edited for concision.">10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="extra29_modal">The modal muddle</h3>
<p>In terms of Kegan’s stages, the largest group of Western adults are somewhere in the 3-to-4 transition. They have some capacity for rule-governed, systematic rationality, but cannot apply it reliably or in all domains.</p>
<p>Most people’s political arguments display a muddled mixture of tribal loyalty and systematic ideology. Their grasp of political principles is superficial. Typically they invoke ideological claims as support for tribal commitments; but, lacking full understanding of the principles, their argument falls apart quickly when challenged. Their usual response is to keep shifting to different semi-principled justifications for their tribal interest, with no overall logical coherence. This is most of what you get when reading amateur politics on the web.</p>
<p>For someone with a stage 4 understanding, arguing with someone like this can be infuriating, because they don’t seem to actually <em>care</em> about the principles, only to assert them when convenient. (Stage 4 cares <em>passionately</em> about principles.) The modal political junkie doesn’t ever seem to know when they’ve lost an argument; they just keep throwing up new objections that don’t quite work either.</p>
<p>In the page on <a href="/atomized-politics">atomized politics↗︎︎</a>, I’ll suggest that developing a systematic political understanding has become an important status symbol over the past decade. It’s proof of the ability to think coherently, in an era in which coherence has disintegrated. Unfortunately, this has <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/section-1-growing-ideological-consistency/">significantly contributed↗︎︎</a> to the increasing polarization of politics during that period.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_nihilism">Eschewing meta-political nihilism</h2>
<p>By “meta-political nihilism” I mean the stance that politics is meaningless, and therefore should be ignored.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_r6u1twj" id="extra29_footnoteref11_r6u1twj" title="This is unrelated to the political movement called “nihilism,” which advocated revolutionary socialist anarchism, and was not nihilist in the present sense at all.">11</a> Three different insights about political meaninglessness can lead to this view. I’ll explain how are each is partly accurate and valuable, but limited.</p>
<p>The sense that politics is <em>so</em> screwed up that it is hopeless can make you <em>wish</em> that it were meaningless, and so pretend to yourself that it is meaningless. But it is not meaningless—there is much at stake—and not, I think, hopeless.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_nihilism-paths">Three paths to meta-political nihilism</h3>
<p>Centrism can lead to nihilism. Centrists observe, accurately, that often the left and right take extreme views on a policy question only for the sake of general political strategy, rather than for reasons based in the specifics of the issue. A middle position may be better, but both sides are unwilling to compromise, not out of actual conviction, but as a game tactic.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote12_1uycllp" id="extra29_footnoteref12_1uycllp" title="The middle is not always correct; I am not advocating centrism for its own sake. Centrism can be motivated just by aversion to conflict, which may be mere cowardice. However, the more polarized politics gets, the more often centrists will be right on average.">12</a> Partisans may also have been able to convince themselves of extreme positions as a consequence of eternalist absolutism; whereas centrists are more likely to recognize the nebulosity of the issue.</p>
<p>Pointing out the errors in extreme positions often only gets you flak from both sides. Culture warriors <em>already know</em> their tribal positions are wrong, but feel they must defend them; making that explicit just annoys them. Recognizing this dynamic does make politics look like a meaningless squabble between two monkey troupes.</p>
<p>Political scientists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAE-gxKs6gM">have found↗︎︎</a> that, over the past couple decades, American centrists have become less and less willing to express opinions, or to engage with either side. Many have withdrawn from politics. This creates a void, which heightens polarization, reinforces the impression that you must swear allegiance to one tribe or the other, and increases still further both sides’ hostility to the middle.</p>
<p>As a second path to nihilism, many partisans eventually do come to realize that tribal politics is wrong. At some point, you start asking yourself “why do I believe this,” and find the answer “because all Good people do” inadequate. (Often this is triggered by accidentally making friends with someone who is not a member of the Good Tribe, having a non-confrontational discussion of a political issue, and finding what they say is weird, but not what you thought the Bad Tribe believed, and that it seems to have just as much connection with reality as what you had believed.) Rather than moving to the center, you may then conclude that all political opinions are arbitrary, motivated only by tribalism, and adopt the nihilistic stance. This is a “3.5” nihilism, intermediate between the tribal and systematic stages.</p>
<p>Alternatively, at that point, you may start looking for some better basis for political judgement. You ask “so how <em>can</em> I know what is right, if not just on the basis of tribalism?” Then you may adopt a systematic, principled ideology. Rather than arguing with tribalists, you argue with other ideologues.</p>
<p>Eventually, if you are intellectually honest, you will realize that neither your system, nor any other, can provide consistently accurate answers to practical political questions. And this is the third path to political nihilism, if you conclude that politics is hopeless and meaningless because all systems are wrong. That is stage 4.5, post-systematic nihilism.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_nihilism-appeal">The appeal and faults of meta-political nihilism</h3>
<p>The central <a href="#chap79">promise of nihilism</a>—not just in politics but overall—is that <em>you don’t have to care</em>. You don’t have to care because it doesn’t mean anything. When politics looks like a chaotic nightmare full of screaming enraged idiots, the promise that it is <em>just</em> sound and fury, signifying nothing, is highly attractive. Nihilism promises that you have no responsibility. When wading into that insane morass looks hopeless, that promise comes as a great relief.</p>
<p>Nihilism offers cool, quiet simplicity and clarity. Clarity that there is <em>definitely</em> no meaning to be found—in politics, for instance—so you need not try to find it. You need not engage with the maddening nebulosity of social issues: the unavoidable ambiguities of right and wrong, the uncertainties of policy outcomes, the constant change that quickly dissolves the underpinnings of any judgement, the mind-boggling complexity of institutions and their incentives and processes.</p>
<p>Nihilism promises that, since it’s all meaningless anyway, things can’t get any worse. For nihilism, everything is always at the zero point. There’s no hope of improvement, but no need to fear negative developments either.</p>
<p>These promises are so appealing that, I think, most people fall into meta-political nihilism quite often, even though nearly everyone is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss27" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'committed', 'gloss27')" title="Committing to a stance means resolving to adopt it consistently, whenever the dimension of meaningness it addresses comes up. [Click for details.]">committed</a> to some form of political eternalism.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_y0goks6" id="extra29_footnoteref13_y0goks6" title="In fact, political nihilism may motivate systematic political eternalism. Michael Travers’ essay “Three forms of antipolitics” suggests that rationalists, libertarians, and Neoreactionaries all advocate logical systems as a way of avoiding the messiness of political conflict. This seems right. Eternalism and nihilism take opposite stands on meaningfulness, but both are based on rejecting nebulosity—i.e. messiness. Both are obviously wrong, but adopting the complete stance requires you to engage with nebulosity squarely, which is so off-putting that it’s common to jump back and forth between eternalism and nihilism to avoid it. In terms of Kegan’s developmental theory, rationalism and libertarianism both typically exhibit stage 4 (systematic) reasoning. Some Neoreactionaries have moved beyond that, explicitly recognizing the inherent limits of systems. The danger here is falling into stage 4.5 nihilism. The “Dark Enlightenment” branch of Neoreaction has, unfortunately, succumbed to that. Others may be working toward a positive meta-systematic alternative, although none is as yet in evidence.">13</a></p>
<p>But, nihilism is wrong. Obviously so.</p>
<p>Politics matters. There is much at stake.</p>
<p>Politics could get <em>much, much</em> worse. Things look a little sketchy here in 2016—but we need some perspective. Compared with most of the 20th century, it’s practically utopian. The quality of governance globally is <em>massively</em> better now than at any time before this century. Even in the developed world, it’s mostly better than in, say, the 1970s.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_fluid">Developing a fluid, meta-systematic understanding of politics</h2>
<p>Systems of government are important and necessary, and a huge improvement on pre-systematic tribalism. However, getting them right cannot, by itself, solve political problems. Systematic political eternalism imagines that a government is a machine, and if designed correctly, you can just set it running and it will get all the right answers. But governments are not, and cannot be, machines.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the systematic view requires recognizing that governmental systems are always nebulous: ambiguous, incomplete, changing, imperfect, and impermanent. This is not because we have yet to locate the correct system; it’s an inherent consequence of the way all systems work.</p>
<p>The actual operation of government <em>orients to</em> a systematic, legal framework; but cannot, even in principle, be <em>governed by</em> it. Laws, regulations, and procedures always have to be interpreted in a concrete situation; they can never be specific enough to spell out precisely what should be done in every instance. This interpretation is always a matter of continual renegotiation; an ongoing accomplishment of participants in particular circumstances. (This language is the same I recently used in <a href="#chap168_gender">discussing gender</a>—not coincidentally!)</p>
<p>No system can guarantee good government. People run a government, not vice versa. Good government requires good faith.</p>
<p>Good societies are those in which there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">common knowledge↗︎︎</a> that most people—and especially most in government—are mostly committed to <em>doing the right thing</em>, where “the right thing” is not definable ahead of time. “Doing the right thing” cannot be forced by any system, because nebulosity makes it impossible to foresee all future circumstances and specify what would be right to do then.</p>
<p><em>Doing the right thing</em> is always collaboratively improvised in concrete circumstances. Well-designed institutions are powerful resources in that collaborative improvisation. However, they are only tools for doing the right thing, never guarantors of it. There are ways to encourage <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss28" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'ethical responsiveness', 'gloss28')" title="Ethical responsiveness is the stance that ethics are not a matter of personal or cultural choice, but are fluid and have no definite source. [Click for details.]">ethical responsiveness</a>, but no way to enforce it.</p>
<p>Stage 5 sees society as an assemblage of transient, contingent systems, which have relative functional value but no ultimate justification. It sees conflicts between groups with different interests as inevitable, and ultimately as non-problematic, even if sometimes harmful in the short run. Since it sees all values as negotiable—although some are more important than others—it has the capacity to build bridges between competing groups and to help resolve their conflicts. It sees changes in values and structures over time as an inherent feature of all systems, and so seeks to steer them toward positive innovations, rather than insisting on preserving a system’s current self-definition.</p>
<p>That is quite abstract. Producing a specific fluid politics is a massive project, that can only be carried forward by many people in collaboration. I do plan to sketch some aspects of one in the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'fluid mode', 'gloss3')" title="The fluid mode of relating to meaningness is the cultural and social analog of the complete stance. It incorporates the accurate insights of eternalism and nihilism, recognizing that meaningness is always both patterned and nebulous.

<blockquote>
<p>E is the letter in today’s sciences of mind. E adjectives proliferate. Nowadays it is hard to avoid claims that cognition – perceiving, imagining, decision-making, planning and so on – is best understood in E terms. The list is long, including: embodied, enactive, extended, embedded, ecological, engaged, emotional, expressive, emergent and so on.</p>
<p>E-approaches propose that cognition depends on embodied engagements in the world. They rethink the alternative, ‘sandwich’ view of cognition as something pure that can be logically isolated from non-neural activity. Traditionally, cognition is imagined to occur wholly within the brain. It occurs tidily in-between perceptual inputs and behavioral outputs. Cognition is informed by, and shapes, non-neural bodily engagements, but cognition and embodied interactions never mix.</p>
<p>A wealth of empirical findings has motivated various challenges to this traditional view. Experimental work encourages the idea that cognition may depend more strongly and pervasively on embodied activity than was previously supposed. Cognition may depend to a considerable extent and might even be constituted by the ways and means that cognizers actively and dynamically interact and engage with the world and others over time.</p>

<p>First, though, the paper. Here it is, verbatim, except I reformatted the footnotes. Also, I’ve included some minor commentary in the body of the paper, in <i>[square brackets and italics]</i>.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>We believe that <dfn>abstract reasoning</dfn> is not primitive, but derived phenomenologically, developmentally, and implementationally from <dfn>concrete activity</dfn>. We summarize recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of concrete activity which suggest paths for exploring the emergence of abstract reasoning therefrom.</p>
<p>We argue that abstract reasoning is made from the same building blocks as concrete activity, and consists of techniques for alleviating the limitations of innate hardware. These techniques are formed by the internalization of patterns of interaction between an agent and the world. Internalization makes it possible to represent the self, and so to reflect upon the relationship between the self and the world. Most patterns of abstract thought originate in the culture. We believe that ideas such as plans, knowledge, complexity, understanding, order, search, and forgetting are learned. We present examples of everyday planning and analyze them in this framework. Finally, we describe cognitive cliches, which we take to be the most abstract mental structures.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_program">Program</h2>
<p>We want to understand the emergence of abstract reasoning from concrete activity. We believe that abstract reasoning is not innate, but derived from concrete activity, in three senses: phenomenologically, developmentally, and implementationally. We hope that an understanding of the first two senses can guide the development of an understanding of the third.</p>
<p>Heidegger argues that the <dfn>phenomenologically</dfn> primordial way of being is involvement in a concrete activity.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_2zpfkbo" id="extra29_footnoteref3_2zpfkbo" title="Martin Heidegger, Being and Time (1962); Hubert Dreyfus, Being-in-the-world: A Commentary on Heidegger’s Being and Time, Division I (1990). [Dreyfus’s book was listed as “forthcoming” in in our paper; we had a photocopy of his pre-publication manuscript, and it was the single biggest influence on our work.]">3</a> Everyday activity consists in the use of equipment for a specific reason. When this activity is going well, it is “transparent.” An experienced driver does not have to think about driving, he just does it; and he can be doing something else, possibly requiring abstract thought, at the same time. It is only when there is a breakdown in the activity that abstract thought is needed. Only when I have too many things to do do I need to make a plan or schedule, to wonder what order to do them in, how they can be most efficiently combined. And it is only when that too fails that I might give up, become curious, and reflect theoretically about scheduling algorithms.</p>
<p>Several branches of psychology suggest that abstract reasoning appears <dfn>developmentally</dfn> later in individuals than involvement in concrete activity. Jean Piaget’s stage theory of cognitive development traces development from the beginning of infancy, in which there are only blind stimulus/response reflexes with no abstraction, representation, or reasoning.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_l1mq28i" id="extra29_footnoteref4_l1mq28i" title="Jean Piaget, The Origins of Intelligence in Children (1952) and Structuralism (1970).">4</a> “Formal operations”—fully abstract reasoning—appear only around puberty. Psychoanalytic developmental psychology (particularly object-relations theory as found in D. W. Winnicott) sees the infant as a chaotic mass of impulses and fantasies leading directly to action.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_hghta2l" id="extra29_footnoteref5_hghta2l" title="D. W. Winnicott, Through Paediatrics to Psycho-Analysis (1975).">5</a> The infant has no self-representation and so is undifferentiated from the world. Gradually, scattered mental elements are integrated to produce adult rational thought. Crucial to the process of integration is <dfn>internalization</dfn>: getting control over interactions with the environment by bringing them inside yourself. Internalization leads to decreased egocentricity. By representing the relationship between his self and the world, a person is better able to be detached from it. Detachment is never complete; the ability to distinguish self from other, fantasy from reality, continues to develop throughout life.</p>
<p><i>[The following paragraph did not appear in the published version of the paper. I’ve derived this web version from the LaTeX source file, which includes notes to myself and some deleted material. A note here says I removed it as “anthropologically controversial.” I’m not sure whether the substance is still <em>anthropologically</em> controversial. The word “primitive” is probably politically incorrect, though.]</i></p>
<p>There is another way in which abstract reasoning is developmentally derived from concrete activity. Abstract reasoning may be a historically recent development, and culturally specific. People in primitive cultures do not engage in such reasoning, at least not to the same extent and not in as sophisticated ways.</p>
<p>The third sense in which we believe abstract reasoning is derived is <dfn>implementationally</dfn>. <dfn>Constructivism</dfn> is the position, held by many developmental psychologists, that human development occurs roughly in stages, and that each stage is built upon the previous one. We believe that abstract reasoning appears late because it is emergent from, or parasitic upon, concrete activity. We want to understand the nature of this emergence relationship. How, even in principle, can abstract thought be mechanistically derived from simple action?</p>
<h2 id="extra29_concrete">Concrete activity</h2>
<p>Study of the emergence of abstract reasoning must begin with an understanding of concrete activity. We believe that the beginnings of such an understanding are found in Gary Drescher’s work on the machinery to implement infant sensorimotor learning and in Agre’s work on that needed to implement adult routine activity.</p>
<p>Agre’s theory of routine activity describes adult action when everything is going well: the fluent, regular, practiced, unproblematic activity that makes up most of everyday life.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_tnreu4z" id="extra29_footnoteref6_tnreu4z" title="Philip E. Agre, “The Structures of Everyday Life,” MIT Working Paper 267, February 1985; “Routines,” MIT AI Memo 828, May 1985. Philip E. Agre and David Chapman, “AI and Everyday Life: The Concrete-Situated View of Human Activity,” in preparation. [We never finished that paper. A fuller account than the 1985 ones would be Agre’s 1997 Computation and Human Experience.]">6</a></p>
<p>The theory includes an account of the innate hardware, which we believe is, loosely, connectionist. It also includes a description of the sorts of cognition and activity that are most appropriate to that hardware. It turns out that the sort of computation most appropriate to the hardware is also the primary sort of computation that actually transpires in everyday life, namely concrete activity.</p>
<p>Routine activity is <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_cognition">situated↗︎︎</a></dfn>: it makes extensive use of the immediate surrounds and their accessibility for observation and interaction. Rather than using internal datastructures to model the world, the world is immediately accessed through perception. Much of the theory is concerned with the emergence of <dfn>routines</dfn>, which are dynamics of interaction: patterns of activity that occur not as a result of their representation in the head of the agent, but due to a Simon’s-ant<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_4ms8lta" id="extra29_footnoteref7_4ms8lta" title="[“Simon’s ant” needed no footnote in 1987.

The world and the mind interpenetrate.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_gqy7tfs" id="extra29_footnoteref8_gqy7tfs" title="[“The world and the mind interpenetrate” is the essential insight of the “E-word movement.” Amusingly, I attached a one-word note to this sentence in the document source text: “Expand.” This is what rationalists/cognitivists/representationalists have the hardest time understanding. I don’t know if any finite expansion is sufficient to induce the meta-rational cognitive flip.]">8</a> Routine activity is conducted in a society of other people, who provide a variety of types of support, from helping when asked to transmitting cultural techniques for solving classes of problems. Routine activity is concerned with the here-and-now; it rarely requires planning into the future, reflection upon the past, or consideration of spatially distant causes. It rarely involves thinking new thoughts; for the most part existing patterns of activity suffice to cope with the situation. Finally, routine activity takes the forms most natural to the hardware: those that can be implemented efficiently on a connectionist architecture.</p>
<p>The architecture we propose to support routine activity consists of a very large number of simple processors. The connectivity of the processors is quasi-static, meaning that the cost of creating a new connection between processors is very high relative to that of using an existing connection. The connections pass tokens from a small set of values, rather than real-valued weights, as in most connectionist learning schemes.</p>
<p>Such an architecture can represent abstract propositions, if at all, only by adding a layer of interpretation which is very computationally expensive. We think that <dfn> indexical-functional</dfn> representations are used instead. These are fully indexical representations which can be evaluated relative to the current situation very cheaply by virtue of their grounding in sensorimotor primitives. They can be thought of as definite noun phrases: an indexical-functional representation picks out, for example, <strong>the cereal box</strong> or <strong>the tea strainer</strong> from the visual field. The indexicality of such representations is mostly a matter of egocentricity. <strong>The cereal box</strong> implicitly means the cereal box in front of <em>me</em>. Compare developmental psychology’s description of child thought as egocentric.</p>
<p>Indexical-functional representations can’t involve logical individuals or variables; the hardware cannot reason about identity. Traditional AI representations use variables which are bound to constants which in turn are somehow connected by the sensory system to objects in the real world. Each constant is connected to a distinct real world object. So, for example, we can say that <strong>all bowls are containers</strong>, and instantiate this on bowl-259. If the bowl-259 is seen later, it will be recognized as the same one. For indexical-functional representations, things that look the same <em>are</em> the same. All you can do is see if there is a bowl there or not. There is no way to represent permanent objects in Piaget’s sense.</p>
<p>Another consequence of quasi-static connectivity is that introspection is very expensive: you can’t examine your own datastructures unless you built them with extra connections and processing elements for the purpose.</p>
<p>The theory of routines is incomplete; it describes adult mental architecture without explaining how that architecture came about. Drescher gives a theory of sensorimotor development motivated to fine levels of detail by Piaget’s observations of the early stages of infant development.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_beniosi" id="extra29_footnoteref9_beniosi" title="Gary L. Drescher, The Schema Mechanism: A Conception of Constructivist Intelligence, unpublished Master’s thesis, MIT Department of EE and CS, 1985. “Genetic AI: Translating Piaget into LISP,” MIT AI Memo 890, 1986. [His 2003 Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence covers continued work in the same framework.]">9</a> He proposes hardware to support the emergence of the necessary software to account for the first five stages.</p>
<p>Drescher’s architecture, the Schema Mechanism, is quasi-static. It consists of very large numbers of <dfn>items</dfn> and <dfn>schemas</dfn>, which respectively represent properties of the world and the effects of actions in situations. Items are boolean-valued representations of conditions in the world. Schemas are indexical assertions that if certain items hold, after a given action other items will hold. The architecture initially has only sensory primitives as items and no schemas. Various learning techniques create new schemas to represent observed regularities, compound procedures for achieving states of items, and synthetic items, which represent conditions in the world which are not immediately observable. Some of these techniques collect empirical statistics to discover correlations. Implementation of the architecture is in progress.</p>
<p>Drescher presents a hypothetical scenario of his architecture progressing through the first five stages of infant development. Initially, all the representations constructed are purely indexical, but eventually these are partly deindexicalized, so that there develop representations of objects independent of the sensory mode in which they are perceived and then of objects independent of <em>whether</em> they are seen. Similarly, actions are initially represented egocentrically, but come to be represented independent of the actor who performs them.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_emergence">The emergence of abstract reasoning</h2>
<p>Abstract reasoning uses abstract representations and performs detached search-like computations.</p>
<p>Abstract representations differ from concrete indexical-functional representations along several dimensions, and intermediates are possible. They are <dfn>universally quantified</dfn> and so capture eternal truths, independent of the current situation. They are <dfn>general purpose</dfn>: a very broad range of sorts of knowledge can be encoded in a uniform framework. They can involve <dfn>variables</dfn> which must be instantiated in use; this requires notions of identity and difference. They are <dfn>compositional</dfn>: sentence-like, in that the meaning of the whole depends on the meanings of the parts. Natural language spans the range from indexical-functional to abstract. Utterances such as “the big one!” (requesting a coworker to pass a hammer) encode indexical-functional representations; those such as “Everyone hates the phone company” are abstract.</p>
<p>By detached computation, we mean that the agent, presented with a situation and a goal, thinks hard about how to achieve the goal, develops a plan, and then executes the plan without much additional thought. Because the agent is detached from the world, he can not depend on clues in the world to tell him what to do, and he must reason about hypothetical future situations, rather than simply inspecting the current state of the world. Any sort of search in an internally represented state-space is a detached computation.</p>
<p>We believe that abstract reasoning uses the same hardware as concrete activity. It is computationally expensive (in general, and particularly on quasi-static hardware), and since it is not necessary for routine activity, it is resorted to only when routines break down, when reflection or problem-solving are required. Thus, we believe that abstract reasoning is <dfn>perforated</dfn>: it is not a coherent module that systematically accounts for all or even a class of mental phenomena. It is not a general-purpose reasoning machine, as it appears to be, but only a patchwork of special cases. (Later in the paper, we sketch a general theory of special cases.) It appears seamless because people are good at giving post-hoc rationalizations for their actions, but those rationalizations are not causally connected to the activity they purport to explain. Techniques are often abstract by virtue of depending only on the form, not the content, of the concrete problems they apply to.</p>
<p>We believe that abstract reasoning consists of a set of techniques, mostly culturally transmitted, for alleviating the limitations of quasi-static hardware to constrain the ways one organizes one’s activity. These techniques are implemented with the same building blocks used in routine activity, but interconnected in different ways, which generally run slowly and consume much hardware. The techniques mostly act to build static networks to routinely cope with some new type of situation: they compile abstract knowledge into machinery for concrete activity. This is similar to chunking in Soar,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_14ednld" id="extra29_footnoteref10_14ednld" title="John E. Laird, Paul S. Rosenbloom, and Allen Newell, “Chunking in Soar: the Anatomy of a General Learning Mechanism,” Machine Learning, March 1986, Volume 1, Issue 1, pp 11–46.">10</a> the use of a dependency network in Agre’s running arguments,<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote11_kn55qu2" id="extra29_footnoteref11_kn55qu2" title="Philip E.

<p>Though abstract reasoning is emergent from computation, there is no reason <i>a priori</i> to suppose that it is also computational. The nature of a system can change radically across an emergent-implementation boundary. For example, from quantum mechanics there emerge chemical systems, which are not quantum mechanical; from chemistry there emerge biological systems, which are not chemical; from biological and from electronic systems there emerge computational systems, which are not biological or electronic. In each of these cases, when we say that a a system is not of a certain sort, we mean that it is best described in other terms. A program can be reduced to a pattern of electrical impulses, but the only way it can be reasoned about in that framework is by blind simulation. Programs participate in emergent rules that allow us to reason about them efficiently and independently of their hardware implementation. We will not be surprised if the mind is similarly made of a stuff that is not computational, though it emerges from a computational medium. Psychoanalysis and anthropology, to name just two disciplines, have made sophisticated but entirely non-computational models of mind-stuff.</p>
<p><i>[The preceding paragraph did not appear in the published paper. My note to myself was “I got too much flak about this”—from readers of draft versions. I guess I’ll be surprised if I don’t get flak again now.]</i></p>
<h2 id="extra29_internalization">Internalization</h2>
<p>The content of routine activity is not innate; it must be learned. The Schema Mechanism provides one account of this development; we don’t know if it is sufficient. But apart from the hardware required, we can study the dynamics of skill acquisition: <em>in what way</em> is it learned?</p>
<p>The problem is in a way more difficult than earlier approaches such as Sussman’s<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote13_07aoj6t" id="extra29_footnoteref13_07aoj6t" title="Gerald Jay Sussman, A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition (1975).">13</a> suggest, because most interesting activity arises not from the execution of plans, which are accessible datastructures, but from interactional routines, which do not derive from explicit representations. You can, and typically do, participate in a routine without being aware of it. So the first step of improving a routine is to make some aspect of it explicit. As each new aspect of a routine is represented, it can be modified. This process rarely terminates in a complete procedural representation.</p>
<p>The making explicit of routines is a good candidate for the mechanistic correlate of the psychoanalytic concept of internalization. Agre’s “Routines” gives this example of internalizing a routine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An everyday example is provided by the myopic vacuumer of dining rooms who hasn’t thought to describe the process as one of alternating between vacuuming and furniture-moving. Explicitly representing that aspect of the vacuuming process should make one think to move all the furniture before getting started…. Vacuuming is often best characterized as interleaving the processes of moving the furniture, running the vacuum around, and returning the furniture. Sometimes it is better to deinterleave these processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t know how internalization happens in general. For lack of a better idea, we reluctantly suspect that a brute-force statistical induction engine is involved. However, something like Dan Weld’s <dfn>aggregation</dfn> would be very useful in detecting loops such as the vacuuming one.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote14_m6z85pg" id="extra29_footnoteref14_m6z85pg" title="Daniel Sabey Weld, “The Use of Aggregation in Causal Simulation,” Artificial Intelligence, 30:1-34, October 1986.">14</a> Unfortunately, known aggregation algorithms do not scale well with the complexity of the input, and probably will fail in the face of the richness of the real world.</p>
<p>A strong clue that a cyclic process is occurring is a rhythm. The Schema Mechanism can be extended with hardware for rhythm detection. Add to each item hardware which keeps a history of the last several changes in value of the item and computes the variance of the Δ<i>t</i>. If the variance is small, a synthetic item can be created to represent the rhythmicity of the given one, and the state of the synthetic item can be maintained in hardware. These synthetic rhythm items themselves can have rhythm detectors, so that more complex rhythms can be detected. How useful such hardware would be remains to be seen.</p>
<p>One result of internalization is the construction of the <dfn>mind’s eye</dfn>. Imagine that parts of the central system can gain write access to the wires on which the outputs of sensory systems, at various levels of abstraction, are delivered to the central system. Then one part of the central system can induce hallucinations, and another part will do something based on what it implicitly supposes are inputs from the world. In order to avoid actually acting in the imaginary situation, it must also be possible to short-circuit outputs to the motor system. In this way, the ability to consider hypothetical situations begins. If the situation is well-enough understood, the results of imaginary actions can be hallucinated. Iterated, this permits the internalization of routines. The resulting internal representation of a routine is another routine which simulates it, interacting with the sensorimotor interface, rather than the real world. This is, we think, the mechanistic correlate of the introspective phenomenon of visual imagery. The mind’s eye extends to all sensory modalities and to motor actions. Constructed similarly is the internal dialog, the sentences we say to ourselves silently. Computation in this internal world is just like computation in the real one; it is just as concrete and situated, except that the situation is imaginary.</p>
<p>We suspect that early language acquisition is intimately tied up with the first development of abstract thought. Natural language provides a bridge between indexical-functional and abstract representations. Children’s first utterances are single words: “ball!” “Mummy!” “hungry!” The production of these highly-indexical “observatives” might very well be directly driven by indexical-functional representations. There follows a long two-word stage, producing utterances like “give ball,” “more cookie,” and “bad kitty.” There is no real syntax to these utterances, but there are a dozen or so different kinds of semantic relationships between the two words to be mastered.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote15_41c4omu" id="extra29_footnoteref15_41c4omu" title="Paula Menyuk, Sentences Children Use (1969).">15</a> The compositionality makes even such simple sentences less than fully indexical. Production of such utterances both requires and drives the development of abstract thought.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_reflection">Reflection and the self</h2>
<p>Brian Smith, in “<a href="http://www.tark.org/proceedings/tark_mar19_86/p19-smith.pdf">Varieties of Self-Reference↗︎︎</a>,”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote16_ogujwnb" id="extra29_footnoteref16_ogujwnb" title="Proceedings of the Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning About Knowledge, Monterey, California, March 1986.">16</a> makes a useful distinction between <dfn> introspection</dfn> (thinking about yourself by virtue of having access to your own datastructures) and <dfn>reflection</dfn> (thinking about the relationship between yourself and the world). Introspection has traditionally been thought necessary for reflection.</p>
<p>The construction of the mind’s eye gives you partial introspective access in a systematic way. You can observe what you would do in hypothetical situations, but without access to the machinery that engenders the action, you won’t know quite how or why. By varying the imaginary situation, you can induce a model of your own reasoning. This model, however, can only be as good as your ability to simulate the world’s responses to your actions, and so must constantly be checked against experience.</p>
<p>Routine activity does not require reflection; the necessary computation just runs. Moreover, quasi-static hardware makes introspection very expensive. We suspect, therefore, that reflection is not only not used in concrete activity, but also is little used in problem solving. It is primarily useful in long-term development: a relatively crude self-model may be good enough to base long-term planning on. This is compatible with the psychoanalytic understanding of self-models, used in determining basic values and orientations, incomplete, inexact, and in pathological cases completely unlike the self that is modeled.</p>
<p>We believe that reflection, rather than being based on introspection, primarily “goes out through the world.” Just as concrete activity generally uses the real world as the model of the world, so reflection uses the world’s mirroring of the self as a model of the self. Smith gives the example of realizing that he is being foolishly repetitive at a dinner party and shutting up. Such a realization might possibly be made by examining one’s own actions, but might much more likely be cued by signs of boredom on the part of the audience. This again is consonant with psychoanalytic emphasis on the role of the mother in mirroring the infant’s facial expressions and gestures and, in later life, the role of the reactions of others in maintaining self-esteem.</p>
<p>Smith is concerned in “Varieties” with translation between the indexical representations needed for concrete activity and the abstract representations needed for reflection. He proposes the use of the self-model as a pivot in this translation. Deindexicalization consists in part in filling in implicit extra arguments to relations with the self. Thus, to take Smith’s example, the sensory item <strong>hungry</strong> can be used concretely to activate eating goals. But to reason about other people’s hunger, it must be deindexicalized to <strong>(hungry me)</strong>, generalized to <strong>(hungry <i>x</i>)</strong>, and perhaps instantiated as <strong>(hungry bear)</strong>. Similarly, only by deindexicalizing the cereal box representation can cereal boxes in general, or cereal boxes remote in time or space, be considered.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_ideology">Cognitive ideology; planning</h2>
<p>The nature of abstract thought, unlike that of concrete activity, is determined by your culture. (The <em>content</em> of concrete activity is of course also culturally determined, but its <em>form</em> is determined by the innate hardware.) We use the term <dfn>cognitive ideology</dfn> to refer to culturally transmitted ways of organizing activity that involve ideas such as plans, knowledge, complexity, understanding, order, search, and forgetting.</p>
<p>We would like to provide an account of planning, an item of cognitive ideology, as a paradigm form of the sort of abstract reasoning we have sketched above. “AI and Everyday Life”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote17_lb8trd0" id="extra29_footnoteref17_lb8trd0" title="[The paper cites “AI and Everyday Life” as “forthcoming,” but it wasn’t. More about that later.]">17</a> argues that very little planning is done in daily life, and that such plans as are constructed are only skeletal, never more than a dozen steps. The latter is a good thing, because <cite>Planning for Conjunctive Goals</cite><a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote18_7oqh250" id="extra29_footnoteref18_7oqh250" title="David Chapman, “Planning for Conjunctive Goals,” Artificial Intelligence 32 (1987) pp. 333-377. Revised version of MIT AI Technical Report 802, November, 1985.">18</a> shows that planning, even in the trivial sorts of domains considered in the AI literature, is computationally intractable.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section presents first-person anecdotes from the daily life of one of us (Chapman). These anecdotes illustrate sorts of activity that are not well accounted for by current AI planning theories and which must be explained either in giving a psychologically realistic account of human activity or in building a robot that acts in real-world domains. Our partial analyses hint at the form an account of planning in the framework of this paper might take.</p>
<p>Classical planning emphasized the means-ends relationship between plan steps and the discovery of order constraints among them based on interactions between pre- and postconditions. Observation of everyday planning leads us to believe that these sorts of reasoning are unusual. In general, the right way to achieve a goal is obvious. Pre- and postconditions are unknown, variable, too hard to represent accurately, or out of the agent’s control. Ordering decisions are generally made for quite other reasons.</p>
<p>When <cite>Planning for Conjunctive Goals</cite> was printed, I sent about sixty copies out to people who had asked for them. I set up an assembly line for putting copies in envelopes and addressing them. The Tyvek envelopes I use have gummed flaps with waxpaper over them; to make them sticky, you pull off the waxpaper, rather than licking the glue. So I pulled the waxpaper off an envelope, shoved a copy of the report in, and sealed the flap. The second time I tried, the glue stuck to the back of the report as it slid half-way in. I had to tear the report away from the flap, damaging both somewhat, and seal the envelope with tape. From then on, I put the reports in before pulling off the waxpaper. In this example, the two steps must be ordered, but it is hard to give an account of the reason in terms of preconditions. You could say that it’s a precondition for putting reports in envelopes that the flap not be sticky, but that isn’t really true; you can still do it if you’re lucky or careful. Such a precondition seems artificial, because it doesn’t tell you <em>why</em> you have to put the report in first. In any case, if there were such a precondition, I didn’t know about it when I started, though I think I had a pretty complete understanding of envelopes and tech reports. The problem was not in the static configuration of the pieces, but a dynamic emergent of their interaction.</p>
<p>Bicycle repair manuals tell you that when you disassemble some complex subassembly like a freewheel, put all the little pieces down on the ground in a row <em>in the order you disassembled them</em>. That’s because (if you know as much about freewheels as I do) the only available representation of the pieces is “weird little widgets.” They are indistinguishable from each other under this representation. Because quasi-static hardware can’t represent logical individuals, you can’t remember (much less reason about) which is which and what’s connected to what.</p>
<p>This story illustrates several themes of the paper. The manual’s advice is a piece of culturally transmitted metaknowledge that allows you to work around the limitations of your hardware in order to perform activity in a partly planned way. The plan—the order in which the freewheel should be reassembled—is not sufficient to completely determine the activity; you still have to be responsive to the situation to see just how each piece should be put back on. In fact, the plan is not even represented in your head, but externally, as a physical row of objects on the floor. Internalization of such an external representation may be the basis of our ability to remember lists of things to do.</p>
<p>I have a very large spice shelf, which until recently was total chaos. It occurred to me one day while fruitlessly searching for a jar of tarragon to alphabetize the shelf. In the course of doing so, I discovered a number of amazing things, among them that I had fourteen bottles of galangal.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote19_toftg1m" id="extra29_footnoteref19_toftg1m" title="[In retrospect, it seems possible that this claim was exaggerated.]">19</a> Galangal is not an easy spice to come by. I realized that every time I went to an oriental food store, as I do every few months, I would remember that difficulty and pick up a bottle. Using the culturally-given idea of alphabetizing, I was able to overcome my inability to introspect about my spice-buying routines. Since this routine (buying a jar of galangal every time) was certainly nowhere explicitly represented, introspection would not have helped even had my hardware supported it. Only if I thought to simulate several cycles of oriental-food-store shopping and could do so accurately (both unlikely) could I have discovered the bug.</p>
<p>Finding a spice jar on an alphabetized shelf is a search <em>in the world</em>, rather than in the head. Internalization of such searches produces the internal searches of which AI currently posits so many.</p>
<p>Sometimes planned action is fluid and routine. I have observed in more detail than belongs here the way I cope with the routine situation of coming through the front door of my house with a load of groceries on my bicycle, while wearing heavy winter clothing. Immediately after opening the door a dozen actions occur to me. This may seem like a lot; because we know how to cope with it, we underestimate the complexity of daily life. These actions for the most part do not stand in a means-ends relationship to each other; they satisfy the many different goals which are activated as I come through the door.</p>
<p><i>[The following discussion interweaves phenomenological observations of an everyday-life routine with unimplemented technical proposals about how to model it. The technical bits assume understanding of the state of the art of AI action theory as of 1986. So, you may want to skip over all that to the <a href="#extra29_cliches">next section</a>. Or, you might find the phenomenology interesting; it’s probably understandable if you just ignore the technical bits.]</i></p>
<p>I can not do all these things at once. However, this situation is routine in the sense that it happens often and I know how to cope with it without breakdown: it is not routine in that it is sufficiently complex and sufficiently variable that I have to plan to deal with it; I don’t have a stored macrop (canned action sequence) for it.</p>
<p>I can plan routinely to deal with this situation because about twenty arguments about how to proceed immediately occur to me. These are just at the fringe of consciousness. I can make them conscious effortlessly, but typically they flash by many per second, so they aren’t fully verbalized in the internal dialog. The arguments concern the order in which the actions should be done. If we were to encode these arguments in a dialectical interpreter, nonlinear planning would fall out automatically. A set of arguments about action orderings effectively constitute a partial order on plan steps. The argument that <i>A</i> should be before <i>B</i> can simply be phrased as objecting to <i>B</i>, non-monotonically dependent on <i>AI</i>’s not having been done; then nonlinear planning and execution fall out directly.</p>
<p>Of the arguments, roughly half are what might be called <dfn>necessity orderings</dfn>. They are arguments about what order things must be done in in order to work at all. They don’t say, action <i>A</i> has prerequisite <i>p</i>, which is clobbered by action <i>B</i>, so do <i>A</i> first; like the envelope example, they are at a higher level. You have to take off your coat before putting it away because… well, because that’s just the way it is. I must have known the reason once; it just seems self-evident now; and certainly doesn’t have anything to do with preconditions.</p>
<p>Besides necessity orderings, there are optimization arguments. Some of these are orderings; some are in the vocabulary of quasiquantitative time intervals. For example, I should lock the door before leaving the front hall, or I will forget to do it once I’m out of that context. Similarly, I should sign up for grocery money spent as soon as possible, because I often forget to do so, but remember now. Here I am working to overcome my own future immersion in a concrete situation. The door should be closed (as opposed to locked) within about ten seconds, because it’s freezing cold out. Again, I need to take off my coat within about a minute, or I will get hot and sweaty.</p>
<p>In fact, it so happens that the set of orderings is cyclic: there is an argument that I should put my keys (which I am holding) in my pocket first thing, to make it possible to grasp my bicycle and push it through the door; but there is also an argument that I shouldn’t put the keys away until I’ve locked the door, which can’t happen until I’ve closed it, which can’t happen until I’ve pushed the cycle through. This registers phenomenologically as a minor hassle; I feel slightly annoyed. Like cycles in planning generally, it must be resolved by adding another step (a white knight): in this case, it was to put the keys in my pocket now and take them out again later.</p>
<p>These arguments don’t take into account the number of available manipulators. For example, I could take off my coat before putting the bicycle up against the wall where it belongs. There is in fact an argument for that: I want to get out of my coat as soon as possible, while it doesn’t matter just when the cycle gets put away. However, I need about one and a half hands to hold up the bike (with its destabilizing load of groceries), so it would be difficult to take off my coat first. Introspectively, I <em>don’t</em> reason about hand allocation as I build the plan; and when I went to set it down on paper, it became obvious why. It’s absurdly difficult. It’s a pain even for a linear plan; you have to keep track of what’s in each hand at every instant. In a nonlinear plan, it seems to be just about impossible.</p>
<p>So I don’t plan manipulator allocation ahead of time; it’s very easy to deal with during execution, because I can just sense what is in my hands at any given instant. This is another example of the immediacy of the world making reasoning easy. Part of the reason this planning is routine and breakdown-free is that it happens that I never run out of hands. This is a contingent, emergent fact about the structure of the world and my ability to plan and our interactions. I couldn’t make the optimal decision in all cases, but I can do well enough in this one. To prove the former point, on the couple of occasions on which the phone has rung as I came in through the door, I experienced a breakdown. I left the door open and it got real cold in the front hall and my bicycle ended up on the floor with groceries spilling out of it and I left my coat on and I ended up feeling upset.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_cliches">Cliches</h2>
<p><dfn>Cognitive cliches</dfn> are Chapman’s theory of the most abstract structures in the adult mind.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote20_tmlgzyw" id="extra29_footnoteref20_tmlgzyw" title="David Chapman, Cognitive Cliches. MIT AI Working Paper 286, February, 1986.">20</a> These structures are substantially less general than, for example, predicate calculus formulae with a theorem prover. Cognitive cliches support only <defn>intermediate methods, which are moderately general purpose, in that a few of them will probably be applicable to any given task; efficient; and not individually particularly powerful. These structures are useful in representation, learning, and reasoning of various sorts. Together they form a general theory of special cases.</defn></p>
<p>A cognitive cliche is a pattern that is commonly found in the world and, when recognized, can be exploited by applying the intermediate methods attached to it. The flavor of the idea is perhaps best conveyed by some examples: <dfn>transitivity, cross products, successive approximation, containment, enablement, paths, resources,</dfn> and <dfn>propagation</dfn> are all cognitive cliches. In general, a cognitive cliche is a class of structures which are components of mental models, occur in many unrelated domains, can be recognized in several kinds of input data, and for which several sorts of reasoning can be performed efficiently. <cite>Planning for Conjunctive Goals</cite> describes the possible application of cliches to classical planning. If a problem can be characterized in terms of certain cliches, otherwise intractable planning problems can be solved by polynomial intermediate methods.</p>
<p>Developmentally, cliches are abstracted from concrete competences in specific domains. Ideally, instances of, say, <dfn>cross-product</dfn> in many domains would be analogically related and the commonalities abstracted into a single coherent, explicitly represented intermediate-competence module. In fact, it seems likely that not all instances of cross-products are recognized as such, and that several clusters of them might join together, creating subtly different intermediate competence. This competence might not be as general in application as ideally it could be, yet still be useful.</p>
<p>What sort of routine activity might cognitive cliches be abstracted from? We suspect that the most basic, central cliches, the naive mathematical ones such as cross-product and ordering, are abstracted principally from the <dfn>visual routines</dfn> described by Shimon Ullman.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote21_sz2fwmg" id="extra29_footnoteref21_sz2fwmg" title="Shimon Ullman, “Visual Routines,” MIT AI Memo 723, June, 1983.">21</a> In thinking about naive-mathematical cliches, we have a strong sense of visual processing being involved. When we think about cross products, we think of a square array or grid; when we think of an ordering, we think of a series of objects laid out along a line. We suspect that these cliches have been abstracted from visual routines for parsing just such images. There is a specific visual competence involved in looking at a plaid fabric, which is the ability to follow a horizontal line, then change to the vertical, and scan up or down, thus reifying the cross point. The internalization of this visual routine and others like it is the ability to see an array in the mind’s eye and similarly to scan either axis. This ability may serve as the nucleus for the development of all the naive-mathematical competence surrounding the idea of cross-products.</p>
<p>Visual routines are procedures for parsing images that are dynamically-assembled from a fixed set of visual primitives. By Ullman’s account, visual routines are compiled from explicitly represented procedures, but they might also be non-represented routines in our sense. We also suppose that oculomotor actions, as well as early vision computations, might be primitives in visual routines. Visual routines are used for intermediate-level vision: the primitives are too expensive to be computed locally over an entire image (as early vision computations are). The routines are executed in response to requirements of a late-vision object-recognition competence, which are too various to build into hardware. The internalization of visual routines results in a mind’s eye that is very far from an array of pixels, but rather consists of just enough machinery to simulate outputs from the visual routine primitives.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper summarizes portions of a paper, “AI and Everyday Life” we are writing about an emerging view of human activity. The new view starts from the concrete and uses an understanding of it to approach the traditional problems of abstract reasoning. This view is shared, at least in part, by many researchers who have come to it independently from very different perspectives. This gives us more confidence in its necessity. In most cases, researchers have reluctantly given up the traditional primacy of the abstract only in the face of some driving problem. Among these problems are programming a mobile robot, writing reflexive interpreters, deriving an ethnomethodological account of human-machine interaction, programming quasi-static computers, encoding complex concrete real-world problems, working around the computational intractability of classical planning, and developing a computational account of what is known in psychology about human development. We believe that finding coherence among such diverse problems will provide a broad base for work in the new view.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote22_45renu1" id="extra29_footnoteref22_45renu1" title="The paper ended with an Acknowledgments section: “Gary Drescher, Roger Hurwitz, David Kirsh, Jim Mahoney, Chuck Rich, and Ramin Zabih read drafts of this paper and provided useful comments.

<h2 id="extra29_afterword">Afterword, 2017</h2>
<p>This paper is part of a century-long conversation that re-thinks <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'meaningness', 'gloss0')" title="“Meaningness” is the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless. It has various dimensions, such as value, purpose, and significance. This book suggests that meaningness is always nebulous—ambiguous and fluid—but also always patterned. Confusion about meaningness results from denying nebulosity or fixating pattern. [Click for details.]">meaningness</a> and what it is to be human.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote23_8x74dww" id="extra29_footnoteref23_8x74dww" title="The conversation begins, arguably, with Heidegger’s Being and Time, published in 1926, but begun several years earlier.">23</a> Some ideas in it were original to Agre and/or myself; but as the footnotes make clear, we took most from diverse disciplines outside of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>There was an extraordinary flowering of this conversation in the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-1980s, when isolated researchers in seemingly unrelated fields realized they were addressing the same issues in similar ways. A key sentence in the paper is: “This view is shared, at least in part, by many researchers who have come to it independently from very different perspectives.” The synergies produced rapid progress and startling results.</p>
<p>Five years later, the movement fizzled out, and the era seems to have been forgotten.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote24_yemuub5" id="extra29_footnoteref24_yemuub5" title="I hope to write more about it soon. Particularly, the central role of Lucy Suchman, who was uniquely able to cross disciplinary boundaries and explain different fields to each other.">24</a> Many, but not all, of our ideas have been rediscovered since, without awareness of this prehistory. “How Embodied Is Cognition?” dates the beginnings of the E- movement to the 1990s, but its central ideas were fully formed in 1986.</p>
<p>The fizzling was, as far as I can tell, due to a series of unfortunate historical accidents, rather than intellectual flaws. We each dropped the research program for reasons of personal circumstance, mainly.</p>
<p>“Abstract Reasoning as Emergent from Concrete Activity” may be the best overall summary of Agre’s and my joint work. (For a dramatically different, more recent overview, see “<a href="#extra5_AI">I seem to be a fiction</a>.”) The paper was a presentation at a conference on models of action. I wrote it as an informal explanation of the conceptual framework for our research program, rather than as a report of results. As a conference paper, it was up against page limits, which may make it dense and difficult to follow.</p>
<p>All our other papers are available on the web, and have been cited several thousand times. This one seems to have been cited only twice. Presumably this is because the proceedings volume immediately disappeared into obscurity. Advice to young researchers: do <em>not</em> bury your most important work in a conference proceedings! It barely counts as an academic publication.</p>
<p>The Conclusion section promises a forthcoming paper “AI and Everyday Life: The Concrete-Situated View of Human Activity.” That was supposed to be the full-length version, with much more explanation, plus detailed reports on technical results. We never finished it. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521386039/?tag=meaningness-20">book versions of Phil’s↗︎︎</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262031817/?tag=meaningness-20">my PhD theses↗︎︎</a> were the most detailed accounts of our research, but they concentrated on technical results rather than the philosophical framework.</p>
<p>I evangelized the concrete-situated (“embodied, enactive, extended, embedded, ecological, engaged, emotional, expressive, emergent”) view at numerous conferences in the late 1980s. Some people <em>got it</em>; most didn’t. There was significant momentum for a while, but once we stopped pushing, cognitive “science” mostly reverted to its comfortable rationalist/representationalist ideology.</p>
<p>It seemed difficult to get the point across. I hope to do better now. Maybe there’s better explanatory technology available!</p>

<p class="meta_para">[I wrote the following in 1992, while I was working on “<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>.” I hope its relevance to that project is obvious.]</p>
<p class="intro_para"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/">Francis Bacon↗︎︎</a>, the ideological founder of modern science, constructed an extensive and explicit analogy between science and rape. Nature is a woman whom the boldly masculine scientist forces to yield her secrets by sexual domination. </p>
<p>Feminist philosophers of science, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Fox_Keller">Evelyn Fox Keller↗︎︎</a>, have suggested that many scientists still see their work this way.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_30utii0" id="extra29_footnoteref1_30utii0" title="But see also counter-arguments from, e.g., Alan Soble.">1</a> They argue that, besides being icky, this approach is unlikely to lead to good science, for the same reason it is unlikely to lead to good sex. One may achieve domination over nature (as indeed we partly have) but one is unlikely to achieve understanding, respect, or (most importantly) delight.</p>
<p>Keller suggests that alternative sexual metaphors are possible. We can not only deconstruct but supplant the Baconian system. Her contribution is the notion of “wet data.” She suggests that the term “hard data” has an obvious underlying sexual sense. Hard data are worshiped by many scientists. As hard as possible: you want to force out of the instrument every decimal place you can get. More interesting, she thinks, are wet data: ones that may be preliminary but lead in intriguing, if perhaps still ambiguous, directions.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I’ve been thinking for a long time about how to describe the way I think research is best done. I’ve taken inspiration from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226950077/?tag=meaningness-20">Hermetic natural philosophers↗︎︎</a>, who like their contemporaries Bacon and Descartes conceived of science sexually, but as ecstatic union rather than as rape.</p>
<p>I’d like to suggest that the process of good research is like cunnilingus.</p>
<p>For the Baconian, one’s attitude toward the phenomenon is one of contempt or enmity. One is unlikely to approach cunnilingus this way. Some other scientists describe their attitude as humility; they are awed by the vastness of the world and of what is unknown. This I think is more likely to foster learning, but perhaps typically of relatively superficial, detailed facts. The best research, I think, is engendered by taking the phenomenon as a respected equal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sch%C3%B6n">D. A. Schön↗︎︎</a> described this as “<a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/pub/uploads/DesignThinking/schon-reflective-conversation-article-1992.pdf">a reflective conversation with the situation↗︎︎</a>”; conversation is only possible with an equal.</p>
<p>To do good work, one must get up-close and personal with the phenomenon. Scientists sometimes talk about “not wanting to get their hands dirty” and about the distasteful necessity of doing so. I would rather say: you have to be willing to get your face wet. The revulsion some scientists have for getting too close to the subject matter does seem parallel to the revulsion some people have for going down. Of course in both cases unless you are seriously hung up you are liable to find, when you try it, that you like it.</p>
<p>Not getting too close to the phenomenon is often justified in terms of “objectivity.” The supposed value of objectivity is that one’s personal prejudices are eliminated. I have not observed this to be the case in practice; and in any case, I believe it is undesirable (as well as impossible) to eliminate the personal from research. I suggest, rather, that one must do research with respect for both the phenomenon and oneself. One must be willing to approach the phenomenon it on its own terms, and one must also honor one’s personal and quirky way of working. Neither of these is encouraged by contemporary scientific ideology.</p>
<p>To give good head you must not lean too heavily on what you already know. Every woman is different, and different each time. An attitude of “I’m going to make you come because I have great technique” is very similar to “I’m going to make this experiment work because I am so brilliant,” and neither works well. This setting aside of one’s existing skills and knowledge and hopes and fears is parallel to objectivity, but distinct. The aim is not to distance oneself from the phenomenon, nor from oneself.</p>
<p>Beyond respect, one must <em>care</em> about the phenomenon. It seems to me that most academic intellectuals I talk to do not genuinely care about their subject matter. They are more interested in getting papers out of it than they are in learning about it. Analogously, many people in approaching sex are more interested in getting something out of someone than they are in learning about another person (and themselves).</p>
<p>A research program typically starts out well, with some exciting preliminary and superficial explorations; and cunnilingus often starts with a relatively brief phase of gentle touching that seems very exciting at first. But then you settle down to serious licking, and this phase is usually frustrating. Often for a long time it seems as though nothing much is going to happen. Your neck hurts and your tongue aches and you wonder if you are ever going to get anywhere. Research is mostly like this. You keep working away at it and you get nowhere, even though you are pretty sure you are doing the right thing. The key thing here is to be attentive to the feedback you are getting from the subject matter. If you keep on mechanically doing the same thing, following recognized procedures, you may get a publication but you won’t learn anything. You have to interpret subtle shifts in the subject matter as telling you what to do differently. (Keller, writing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_McClintock">Barbara McClintock↗︎︎</a>’s work on maize transposons, terms this “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805074589/?tag=meaningness-20">a feeling for the organism↗︎︎</a>.” It’s the same whether the organism is an ear of corn or another person.)</p>
<p>Presently there comes a point at which you realize you are definitely onto something. Often you can’t tell quite where your investigations are taking you, but you get a strong sense that the subject matter is going somewhere. Pieces of a story start to emerge; while the shape of the eventual discovery is as yet unclear, you are confident that it is on its way. Similarly, there is usually a distinct point at which her breathing or muscle tension changes to tell you that yes, she’s going to come. It’s not clear yet when or what it will be like, but it’s on its way. At this point, with a sense of excitement, you renew your commitment to the task. It can still happen that, frustratingly, you never get anywhere, but the signal itself is still clear: something real was happening, and if you return to that point on another occasion, as one often returns to a half-written paper a couple years later, you will be given another chance.</p>
<p>Finally there is that exhilarating moment when the subject matter grabs your head by the legs and pulls you along on a wild ride. This can be frightening and uncomfortable, but you have to go with it, not try to control it, let the subject matter take over. The myth of the sober scientist is hooey; if discovery is not intoxicating, you are doing something very wrong. Very suddenly the project you have been working on for months takes off: you have a rush of discoveries that lead in unexpected directions, all the pieces fall into place, the shape of the whole becomes apparent. Hard work is rewarded.</p>

<p>Here are ten quite different ways you could argue it is not true, or that we don’t really know:</p>
<!--break-->
<ol>
<li>One should never hold any belief with absolute certainty. We can say that “George Washington was the first President” is <em>probably</em> true, and we can use evidence to calculate that probability. However, it’s misleading and meaningless—or outright wrong—to claim that it’s simply “true.” One can only ever say “given such-and-such observations, the probability that Washington was the first President is 0.99” (or whatever the correct number is). If you are too lazy to do the math, then at the absolute minimum you must always explicitly acknowledge “this is probably true, but it could be false, too.”</li>
<li>The first President was John Adams, and no one questioned that at the time. In the 1830s, there was massive rewriting of history to justify Andrew Jackson’s coup against the Adams Dynasty. That was so successful that only a few historians—now dismissed as cranks—know the truth.</li>
<li>“Presidency” is an essentialist delusion. There is no set of objective features that correspond to “being President.” If you dissected Barack Obama, you could not find his supposed “President-ness” anywhere. The same would have been true of Washington. This is not merely a limitation in our knowledge; “Presidency” simply isn’t a physical property of some people. There’s no separate non-physical reality, so there’s no such thing as a “President.”</li>
<li>“Presidency” is a subjectivist delusion. It’s an objective fact that almost everyone <em>believes</em> Washington was the first American President. When we know more neuroscience, we’ll be able to find those beliefs with brain scans. But mere collective belief can’t make something exist; nearly everyone used to believe in ghosts.</li>
<li>Washington was the <em>second</em> President. You cannot step in the same river twice: because the river is never the same again, but more importantly because <em>you</em> are never the same person again. Likewise, you cannot elect the same person President twice. The first President (1789–1793) was also <em>named</em> “George Washington,” but he had not yet evolved into his final form. The true George Washington was President from 1793–1797.</li>
<li>George Washington no longer exists. Anything you say about a non-existent object is necessarily meaningless, not true or false. You might as well make claims about colorless green ideas.</li>
<li>“The United States” does not refer to a solid, distinct, changeless, clear, well-defined entity. The term is necessarily unclear in some ways, and the thing itself is necessarily somewhat <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulous', 'gloss0')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulous</a>. The phrase certainly meant something quite different in the 1700s than it does now. We cannot make durable, definite claims about fluid, indefinite entities.</li>
<li>Due to technical irregularities, Washington was not elected in full compliance with Constitutional procedures. Although he acted <em>as if</em> he were President, and everyone regarded him as President at the time, he actually wasn’t. The true first President, elected in full conformity with Constitutional requirements, was John Adams.</li>
<li>Although Washington was the first President <i>de jure</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe">William Howe↗︎︎</a> earlier exerted sufficient authority throughout Anglophone America that he ought to be recognized as the first President <i>de facto</i>.</li>
<li>The Revolutionary War was an illegitimate rebellion against a legitimate government, and so cannot have established a genuine state. The British Crown remains the legitimate government of North America, and “The United States” is a propaganda fiction. America has never had a “President.”</li>

<h2 id="extra29_meta-systematic">Getting meta-systematic cognition wrong—and right</h2>
<p>All these objections are silly and wrong.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_3dpd1q9" id="extra29_footnoteref1_3dpd1q9" title="They are also fun; it’s tempting to add to the list. Maybe you’d like to do that in the comments?">1</a> How and why?</p>
<p>Each uses some system of reasoning that, while sometimes valid and helpful, is worse than useless <em>in this case</em>. There’s nothing wrong with any of the systems; they are just wrong ones to apply here.</p>
<p><dfn>Judging whether or not a system applies</dfn> is the simplest form of <dfn><a href="#extra12">meta-systematic reasoning</a></dfn>. Meta-systematic reasoning is the cognitive aspect of <a href="https://vividness.live/2015/10/12/developing-ethical-social-and-cognitive-competence/#fluid">Kegan’s “stage 5”↗︎︎</a>, the <a href="#chap149">fluid mode</a>, or the <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'complete stance', 'gloss1')" title="Complete stances acknowledge the nebulosity and pattern of meaningness, avoiding the errors of fixation and denial.  They are more difficult to adopt than confused stances, but are more workable in the long run. [Click for details.]">complete stance</a>. (These are different terms for more-or-less the same thing.) I have suggested that broader understanding of meta-systematicity is <a href="#extra12">currently critical</a> to the survival of civilization, so I plan to be helpful by saying more about it. This post is a starting point—beginning with the simplest manifestation.</p>
<p>My hope is that the ridiculous examples start to give a sense of what “meta-systematicity” means. Eventually I hope to say much more, across many web pages. For now, perhaps some readers can extrapolate to other aspects of meta-systematicity, or even to the whole thing.</p>
<p>(Some other forms of meta-systematic cognition are figuring out <em>how</em> to apply a system in a concrete situation; combining systems, or parts of them; and creating new systems. Also: systems generally apply more-or-less well, and never quite perfectly, so the judgement is of whether a system applies <em>well enough</em>. For clarity and simplicity, in this post I analyze atypically silly examples in which a system fails to apply at all, or is drastically mis-applied, so the judgement can be quite definite.)</p>
<h3 id="extra29_neither">Judging is neither determining nor intuiting</h3>
<p>“Judging” is a careful choice of word: it is neither “determining” nor “intuiting.” “Determining” would be systematic, and “intuiting” would be anti-rational. </p>
<ul>
<li>Some systems come with systematic criteria for whether they apply. For instance, some programming languages can handle parallel processing, and some can’t. In such cases, we can definitively <dfn>determine</dfn> whether a system applies, using systematic rationality. Although that is reasoning about a system, it is not “meta-systematic,” in the sense I use the term. “<dfn>Meta</dfn>-systematic” means using systems in ways that are not themselves systematic.</li>
<li>Meta-systematic judgement is not some sort of Romantic intuition, mystical insight, or super-Turing woo. Often, it is easy. I made the ten objections deliberately ridiculous to show how obvious and down-to-earth it can be. Meta-systematic cognition does not reject either common sense or systematic rationality. In fact, it depends on both.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it is easy to explain why each of the ten objections mis-uses a system, the reason each is silly is specific to it, and to Washington’s Presidency. The <em>form</em> of each objection is valid when applied to other claims. None of the objections is formally illogical. None is irrational according to any systematic theory of rationality. </p>
<p>What is hard is to say <em>in general</em> when a system of reasoning is applicable. Judging applicability is <dfn>human-complete</dfn>, in fact. By that, I mean that there is no aspect of human beingness that is not potentially relevant. (I do not mean that humans are somehow special, so that we can resolve questions of judgement by magic.)</p>
<p>Judgement cannot be reduced to any algorithm, or set of determinate criteria.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_rz33wni" id="extra29_footnoteref2_rz33wni" title="You might object that every human, being a bounded volume of spacetime, is fully described by physical laws, and therefore algorithmic and systematic. This is arguably true, but not in an interesting or relevant sense. This post does not explain what I mean by a “system,” because that would be a long story. Roughly, I mean something humans can reason with. A particle-level specification of a macroscopic quantity of matter is not that. An algorithm, by some definitions, is “an effective procedure.” An “algorithm” that consists of a Unified Theory of fundamental physics plus the quantum state of a person is not meaningfully effective, even if it fits the mathematical definition.">2</a> In general, there is no end to the kinds of evidence and kinds of reasoning that might go into a judgement. Each has to be evaluated on its own, idiosyncratic merits. In many cases, this means that a judgement cannot be made, or can only be tentative. In others—such as the question of whether Washington was the first American President—a judgement can be quite certain.</p>
<p>This implies that epistemology is also human-complete. There can be no systematic “scientific method.” The best we can get is meta-systematic judgement among alternative lines of investigation.</p>
<p>That is a larger claim than I can justify in a blog post. However, I hope this post will help you see why it might be true.</p>
<h3 id="extra29_analyzing">Analyzing ten meta-systematic failures</h3>
<p>The rest of this post goes through each of the ten objections and:</p>
<ul>
<li>explains what system is being misapplied;</li>
<li>explains that it’s a perfectly sensible system that is often useful;</li>
<li>explains why it doesn’t apply to Washington’s Presidency;</li>
<li>begins to explain why its range of applicability cannot be specified systematically.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t attempt to <em>prove</em> that any of these systems lacks systematic applicability criteria. An argument about that could be unboundedly complex and difficult—precisely <em>because</em> it’s meta-systematic, and therefore human-complete.</p>
<p>My discussions of applicability will be brief and vague; this post is quite long even so. For some of the systems, the analysis may still get more technical than you want to read. In that case, it’s safe to skip ahead to the next.</p>
<p>Among the ten objections, the first two are <dfn>epistemological</dfn>: they claim we have inadequate evidence to know that Washington was the first American President. The rest are <dfn>ontological</dfn>, concerning the fundamental nature of things. Objections 3 and 4 challenge the reality of meaningness: is there even any fact-of-the-matter about who the President was? The next three point out the fundamental <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nebulosity', 'gloss2')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">nebulosity</a> of all objects. And the last three rely on the nebulosity of social institutions specifically.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a misapplication of probabilistic reasoning.</p>
<p>Probability theory is one of the most valuable systems of formal rationality. It is central in many fields of science, engineering, medicine, economics, business strategy, and public policy analysis. Everyone should learn the basics of probabilistic reasoning in high school.</p>
<p>Probability theory is also completely useless in most everyday situations, and also in many fields of science, engineering, and so on. In the case of Washington’s Presidency, attempting to compute a probability would be completely meaningless. Also, it is so close to 1.0 that even if it could be computed accurately, it wouldn’t be useful. Most of the time, trying to reason probabilistically is dumb.</p>
<p>Under what circumstances is probability theory useful?</p>
<p>Some things—like Washingon’s Presidency—are too certain. Most things are too uncertain. I started laying the groundwork for a broad analysis of “too uncertain” in “<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/igv/probability_knowledge_and_metaprobability/">Probability, knowledge, and meta-probability↗︎︎</a>” and “<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/igw/probability_and_radical_uncertainty/">Probability and radical uncertainty↗︎︎</a>,” but unfortunately haven’t gotten around to finishing that sequence of posts.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_804314f" id="extra29_footnoteref3_804314f" title="Partly because LessWrong imploded. Maybe I should finish them here?">3</a></p>
<p>Applicability can’t just be reduced to a restricted range of degrees of certainty, however. In “<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>,” I suggested that there are many different kinds of uncertainty. Any particular situation typically involves several, some more amenable to probabilistic modeling than others. This makes questions of <em>whether</em> and <em>how</em> to apply probability theory complex.</p>
<p>I have a draft post on judging when probability theory will work. (This might help un-stick those who want to believe it’s always the answer to everything.) What features of a situation allow you to assign meaningful probability estimates? There are many <em>heuristic</em> considerations that can go into that judgement. Recognizing these can be valuable in practice. On the other hand, they are necessarily vague, domain-dependent, and unbounded. (<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'Nebulous', 'gloss3')" title="Nebulosity is the insubstantiality, transience, boundarilessness, discontinuity, and ambiguity that (this book argues) are found in all phenomena. [Click for details.]">Nebulous</a>, in other words.) There can be no precise, general, systematic answer.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=4127">recent satire of Bayesianism↗︎︎</a> turns on this unboundedness. Applying probability theory requires circumscribing the hypothesis space (as I explained in “<a href="#extra9">How To Think Real Good</a>”), and there is no systematic way to do that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s widely known that Washington wore false teeth, made of wood. This <a href="http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/false-teeth/">is false↗︎︎</a>; none of his dentures were made of wood.</p>
<p>It is also widely known that the story about young George and the cherry tree is a myth. The fable was generally accepted as fact during the 1830s, however. Even now, it is not widely known that it was <a href="http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/cherry-tree-myth/">fabricated by a historian↗︎︎</a>, in 1806, to promote a particular political program.</p>
<p>It is widely known that Buddhism is the religion taught by the historical Buddha, named Siddhartha Gautama, who lived about 2500 years ago. This is false. There is <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24039898/The_Idea_of_the_Historical_Buddha_Presented_at_17th_Congress_of_IABS_Vienna_August_2014_">no good historical evidence↗︎︎</a> of Gautama’s existence. If he did exist, there is insufficient evidence to determine what he taught. We do know for sure that most of Buddhism was <em>not</em> taught by him, because it can be reliably dated to much later eras. Most of “Buddhist history” has been shown by recent mainstream scholarship to have been fabricated, in various centuries after the supposed events, to justify then-current political movements.</p>
<p>This is closely parallel to the claim that Washington’s Presidency was fabricated to erase from history the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_political_family">Adams family↗︎︎</a>’s hereditary monarchy. It’s just that Gautama’s teaching <em>was</em> invented later, and Washington’s Presidency <em>wasn’t</em>. How do we know?</p>
<p>Some details of what mainstream experts currently believe about Washington may be wrong, because they have mistakenly accepted evidence from fabricated historical documents. I hope you will agree, though, that it is not meaningfully possible that his entire Presidency was fabricated. How do we know?</p>
<p>There’s two questions here, actually: how do <em>historians</em> know, and how do <em>we</em> know that they know? This is an instance of <dfn>socially distributed knowledge</dfn>. We <em>do</em> know Washington’s Presidency couldn’t have been fabricated, but we know that only in dependence on a community of experts. No single historian knows independently, either; each of them depends on the rest.</p>
<p>Professional historians use a wide variety of technical methods for evaluating different kinds of evidence, and coming to conclusions based on them. All these methods involve judgement, however. You cannot systematically assign a numerical “strength of evidence” to a hand-written letter signed “Geo. Wash.”, a painting of the First Inauguration, and a 1794 newspaper article, add it up and declare “p&lt;0.05: we <em>know</em>.” There is no end to the considerations that might be relevant to whether any such things may have been faked. In some cases—including this one—rational certainty can be reached, however.</p>
<p>(By the way, the painting at the head of this page is <em>supposedly</em> of Washington’s First Inauguration in 1789. It hangs on the wall in Federal Hall. However, reliable-sounding sources suggest it was painted a century later, in 1889, by one Ramón de Elorriaga. Other reliable-sounding sources suggest that this attribution is dubious, so maybe no one knows where the painting came from. Based on a casual web search, it seems that there is no surviving depiction of either of Washington’s Inaugurations that was created within his lifetime. I’m not sure, though!)</p>
<p>The question of how we know the experts know is still more nebulous—although no less certain. Entire professions full of mainstream experts can be <a href="#chap72">totally wrong</a>, as in <a href="#chap73">the case of nutrition</a>. I personally know almost nothing about what sort of evidence for Washington’s Presidency is available for professional historians. Instead, my judgement is that if there were any meaningful chance that they were wrong, I would know about it. It is hard to say what that judgement rests on, though!</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism">Essentialism↗︎︎</a> is a ubiquitous metaphysical error. It features in theories according to which meanings are objective, or inherent in the things that have the meaning. It is closely related to <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss4')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalism</a>, and is harmful for many of the <a href="#chap37">same reasons</a>.</p>
<p>One current manifestation is the increasingly acrimonious debate over whether trans people are male or female. Most participants, on both sides, agree that trans people are <em>inherently, objectively, essentially</em> one sex or the other. They only disagree about which sex that is, and what the criteria are for determining this objective truth! This seems plainly wrong to me. Sex (like everything) is somewhat nebulous. There are irreducible gray areas. Insisting that there is a clear-cut objective fact about whether some people are male or female is politically-motivated metaphysical nonsense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, vacuum cleaners do objectively, inherently suck. If you disassemble one you can see how and why. And in most cases, it’s clear what sex someone is, in ways that depend largely on physical facts, not social agreements. However, there is no sharp boundary between the gray areas and the clear-cut cases. One might say that “transness” is a matter of degree, and continuously graded; but even that would be a gross oversimplification.</p>
<p>Back to Presidency. The “dissection” objection is quite right that it is not an objective, inherent property of a person. This is an important point. I will make a similar argument in “<a href="#chap106">A billion tiny spooks</a>,” against the claim that knowledge is an objective, inherent property of a person. The <dfn>representational theory of mind</dfn> says that my knowing Washington was the first President consists of having that written down in my brain somewhere. This can’t be true, partly because (as I wrote above) that knowledge is socially distributed.</p>
<p>But then what? The following objection points out, also correctly, that Presidency is not a matter of subjective agreement. If Presidency is neither objective nor subjective, that might seem to cover all bases. And if it is not a property of an individual, nor a social agreement, what sort of a thing could it be? Should we conclude that it does not exist?</p>
<p>One could say that “Presidency” exists “in the domain of meanings”—although that is also misleading. The book will eventually explain how meanings can be <a href="#chap110">neither objective nor subjective</a>, but real just the same. They are also not non-physical, or “mental.” They are non-local interactional dynamics.</p>

<p>When the objective, <dfn>correspondence theory of truth</dfn> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691141320/?tag=meaningness-20">started to break down↗︎︎</a>, philosophers advocated various alternatives. One was the <dfn>consensus theory</dfn>, that truth is simply a matter of agreement. In the case of physical facts, this is obviously idiotic. (Although some “spiritual” people do still apply it.)</p>
<p>In the domain of meanings, the consensus theory is also wrong, but less obviously so. It is common for otherwise-intelligent people to explain social institutions as “collective hallucinations.” A hallucination means a mistaken perception of something that is not <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss5')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.

But are we mistaken to believe that there is such a thing as a President? Clearly not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the objection is right that everyone believing someone is President does not make him so. Let’s say John Adams XIV, the popular Party Planner of the college Glee Club, was voted in as President of the Club. Naturally, everyone (including John XIV) believed he <em>was</em> President. A few months later, the Treasurer discovered that, in XIV’s former Party Planner role, he had been skimming cash from the amounts entrusted to him for beverage purchase. Clearly he had to be removed as President, but no one knew off-hand what the official way to do this was. Someone remembered that the Club had an ancient set of bylaws, which no one had looked at in years. Reading through them carefully, the Club’s other officers discovered that the section on elections stated that the winner of an election was the person who got the most votes, unless they had committed “moral turpitude in respect of the purposes of the Club.” Embezzlement is mentioned as an instance of “moral turpitude.” Under the wording of the bylaws, it’s irrelevant to the election outcome whether anyone <em>knew</em> about it—only that it had happened. Thus, XIV had <em>never been</em> President—even though everyone had thought he was.</p>
<p>Beliefs play important roles in most meanings, and most social institutions. However, they don’t fully constitute either. The roles beliefs do play are generally complex, nebulous, and not understandable in systematic terms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“The same river” is a theme of the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who emphasized constant change. Famously, he said “πάντα ῥεῖ”: everything flows. But what he said about the river was more complicated than usually remembered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ποταμοῖς τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἐμβαίνομέν τε καὶ οὐκ ἐμβαίνομεν, εἶμέν τε καὶ οὐκ εἶμεν.</p>

<p>When has something changed enough that it is no longer the same thing? This is the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-relative/#2">problem of transtemporal identity↗︎︎</a>. Another ancient Greek formulation is “the ship of Theseus.” Suppose that, as a result of a series of repairs, every board in the boat is eventually replaced; is it still the same one? Suppose the ship’s carpenter saved all the worn boards and later assembled them into the same form as the original ship (albeit rather beaten-up-looking). Would that be the same boat? It is and it is not.</p>
<p>There can be no general, systematic, or definite answer. There is no fact-of-the-matter about whether the Truckee River is the same river today as when I stepped in it last week. There is no fact-of-the-matter about whether I am “the same person” today as when I stepped in it last week, or when I first did decades ago. Same in what way?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we can often make judgements about whether something is the same thing <em>for particular purposes</em>. Although no systematic criteria apply, we can say quite firmly that it’s silly to claim that the President of 1789 was not the same person as the President of 1793.</p>

The main motivation was to reject religious claims about non-existent objects such as God, souls, and Heaven. In general, this is sensible and right. You might as well say “colorless green ideas sleep furiously” as “the Holy Ghost proceeds from God the Father.” Both are meaningless—in some sense—because they refer to objects that we can’t observe and therefore don’t exist.</p>
<p>However, no one has been able to make positivism into a coherent system. The <dfn>logical positivism</dfn> of the early 20th century said all statements were unambiguously true, false, or meaningless, and ones about non-existent objects were definitely in the third category. This makes sense, but fails on some examples.</p>
<p>George Washington does not exist—not in 2016. We cannot observe or measure him. Accordingly, some positivists backed themselves into the corner where they were forced to say that statements about past objects are meaningless. This, obviously, is silly—but it’s hard to explain precisely why.</p>
<p>I said that none of the ten objections were formally irrational. Might this one be an exception? There is no logical fallacy, but one could reasonably argue that a metaphysics of transtemporal predication must be part of any general theory of rationality. On the other hand, I don’t know of any credible account. (Dealing with the problem of transtemporal identity would be only one of several difficulties.)</p>
<p>In fact, we <a href="#chap69">don’t have</a> any general theory of rationality. Logical positivism was the last serious attempt to develop one. By the 1960s, it had unambiguously failed, for several reasons, any one of which would have been fatal.</p>

<p>There is another slippery slope here. George Washington does not exist, but it is straightforwardly true to say that he was the President.

That we can make definitely false statements about Gandalf does imply we can make meaningfully true ones too. Unfortunately, this suggests “the Holy Ghost proceeds from mayonnaise” is definitely false, which suggests that “the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father” is also true in some sense.

<p>“The United States” does not refer to a solid, distinct, changeless, clear, well-defined entity.

<p>This is a misapplication of the nebulosity-and-pattern framework described in <cite><a href="/#contents">Meaningness</a></cite>!</p>
<p>According to that framework, <em>nothing</em>, even a steel ball, is perfectly solid, distinct, changeless, clear, or well-defined.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_syex9p7" id="extra29_footnoteref6_syex9p7" title="These five characteristics are the fixations of the five aspects of form (pattern) according to Vajrayana Buddhism. I’ve alluded to the Buddhist framework for historical and humorous reasons only. The five-fold structure is a surprisingly useful heuristic, but is not seriously included in the Meaningness analysis of nebulosity and pattern.">6</a> Much less so a country. The United States is unquestionably intangible, fuzzy, changeable, vague, and ambiguous. </p>
<p>In fact, the ontological status of a state is deeply mysterious. We think we know what sort of thing a steel ball is: a “macroscopic physical object.” What <em>that</em> means is <a href="#chap95">more mysterious</a> than you might suppose, but at least we have a word for it.</p>
<p>What is a country? Maybe it is a “social institution,” which somehow lives in the intangible realm of meanings. But a country also has a geographic extent, unlike institutions such as a glee club. That geographic extent, nevertheless, is somewhat vague. As you can see from the map above, the boundaries of the United States were unclear in 1789, and have changed frequently since. Even now, its boundaries are disputed, and there are many places that are part of the United States for certain purposes and not for others. Puerto Rico and Guantanamo Bay are two quite different examples. </p>
<p>The transtemporal identity of countries is even vaguer than that of rivers or people. China, like the ship of Theseus, was disassembled in its 1949 Civil War, and the pieces reassembled into the Republic of China (“Taiwan”) and the People’s Republic of China, which may or may not be two different countries, either or both of which may or may not be the same country that existed before 1949.</p>
<p>For those of a positivistic bent—and I include myself in that category—it’s tempting to throw up our hands and say “states are collective hallucinations; they are metaphysical spooks; they don’t <a href="#chap96">really exist</a>.” But this is <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss9" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss9')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning.

Denying the existence of the United States is silly.</p>
<p>“We cannot make durable, definite claims about fluid, indefinite entities” is often importantly true. Social justice is a standard example. It is not meaningless and not non-existent, but it is highly nebulous. Claiming that social justice has unchanging and absolute implications is a common move in current political discourse, but it is usually silly. It is a form of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss4" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss4')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.

<p>Granting the existence of the United States, <em>and</em> granting that it is fluid and indefinite, can we make durable and definite claims about it? Yes. “Washington was the first American President” is a durable claim: it will still be true in a thousand years, even if the United States has ceased to exist. It is a definite claim: it was George Washington who was President, not Martha Washington, and not George William Frederick.</p>
<p>So when can we make durable, definite claims about fluid, indefinite entities, and when can we not? That is a matter of judgement, and unbounded considerations may be relevant.</p>

<p>Due to technical irregularities, Washington was not elected in full compliance with Constitutional procedures. Although he acted <em>as if</em> he were President, and everyone regarded him as President at the time, he actually wasn’t. The true first President, elected in full conformity with Constitutional requirements, was John Adams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably factually false; I just invented technical irregularities in Washington’s election.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_sgx7r8u" id="extra29_footnoteref7_sgx7r8u" title="I don’t know that there weren’t any, though.

It’s a misapplication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_constructionism">strict constructionism↗︎︎</a>, the idea that the only thing that counts is what the Constitution says. If there <em>had</em> been a minor procedural glitch in Washington’s election, it wouldn’t matter. But there are many cases in which technicalities do count. Discovering them may reverse the result of an election that had been thought settled—as in the case of John Adams XIV.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_ax5rbrt" id="extra29_footnoteref8_ax5rbrt" title="There’s an entertaining, although silly, argument that David Rice Atchison was President for one day in 1894, due to a procedural glitch.">8</a></p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson was one of the first advocates of strict constructionism. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party">His Republican Party↗︎︎</a> opposed the growing power of the national government, and supported state’s rights. The Constitution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">says↗︎︎</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefferson argued that it meant what it said, and the United States could not do anything the Constitution did not specifically say it could. His former friend John Adams, a Federalist, argued that the Constitution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_powers">implied powers↗︎︎</a> it didn’t expressly mention.</p>
<p>Both positions are reasonable, but seem incompatible. The bitter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800">election of 1800↗︎︎</a> pitted the two men against each other as candidates for President—and their Constitutional interpretation philosophies against each other as candidates for the national political ideology. This election <em>was</em> marked by multiple technical irregularities. It was also perhaps the most divisive in American history. Jefferson feared that Adams intended to found a hereditary monarchy; Adams feared that Jefferson intended to break up the Union. Both may have been right.</p>
<p><em>Strictly</em> strict constructionism is actually impossible.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_kislf0c" id="extra29_footnoteref9_kislf0c" title="And “strict constructionism” is not well-defined itself. It’s related, in ill-defined ways, to several similar ideas: textualism, originalism, and judicial restraint. None of those is well-defined either. These are important and useful concepts nonetheless.">9</a> Laws are not like computer programs, which causally engender exactly the computations they describe. There is no such thing as an entirely literal and context-free meaning of a text; human languages doesn’t work that way. Applying anything written in a human language always, necessarily, requires interpretive judgement in a concrete situation. Interpretation always, necessarily, depends on unbounded considerations, and so cannot be reduced to a system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some legal interpretations are more literal, and others more contextual. In practice, courts have to steer between the Scylla of literalist myopia and the Charybdis of judicial activism.</p>
<p>So, when do electoral technicalities count? Why should we apply a “strict” standard to John Adams XIV and a “contextual” one to George Washington?</p>
<p>This is a judgement, for which an unbounded set of considerations may apply. There can be no systematic answer; one can only say that most of the considerations, or the stronger considerations, point one way or the other. Here are a few, offhand, in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Electoral College’s vote was unanimous both times Washington was elected. If a procedural error had been found and the vote repeated, we can be reasonably certain Washington would have won again. We can be reasonably sure that if a new vote were held, John Adams XIV would lose. In neither case is there any legal basis for a re-vote, but the outcome of the thought experiment is a relevant consideration.</li>
<li>The system under which Washington was elected was brand new, and unlike anything that had been tried elsewhere.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_67ocbqb" id="extra29_footnoteref10_67ocbqb" title="With the interesting, but dubious, possible exception of the Iroquois Constitution.">10</a> Complicated new systems inevitably have minor bugs, which get ironed out quickly with experience. In a new system, the designers’ intent matters more than texts or precedent. There is no question that the writers of the Constitution wanted Washington as President. On the other hand, in a long-standing system that is known to work generally well, stability is more important than the designers’ intent, which may be forgotten or irrelevant to new conditions. The Glee Club bylaws were “ancient” and also were probably similar to those of similar organizations; they can be assumed to have been mainly debugged and therefore functional.</li>
<li>The stakes were much higher in Washington’s case than John XIV’s. Doubts about whether Washington was actually President could easily have torn the Union apart. (Consequences count.) Washington <em>acting</em> as President of the United States (whether he “<a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'really', 'gloss5')" title="“Really” is a weasel-word.  It is used to intimidate you into accepting dubious metaphysical claims.  When someone uses it, substitute “in some sense,” and then ask “in what sense?” [Click for details.]">really</a>” was or not) was enormously significant; XIV acting as President of the Glee Club was not.</li>
<li>Indeed, Washington in part <em>defined</em> what it means to be an American President, by example. He was elected to an office whose nature was only vaguely specified in the Constitution. The Electoral College mostly just wanted <em>him</em> in charge; they elected a person, not an official.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these is a strong argument; but taken together, I think the case is reasonably clear.</p>
<p>(Before we move on: the story of Adams and Jefferson’s friendship, their subsequent enmity, and their eventual reconciliation is fascinating. <a href="http://www.georgetowner.com/articles/2013/jul/03/adams-jefferson-july-4-1826/">Here↗︎︎</a> is a brief account. The two men both died on July 4th, 1826, fifty years to the day after the signing of the Declaration of Independence that they co-wrote.

<figcaption class="ctrimgcaption">The Right Honorable Viscount General Sir William Howe</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Washington was the first President <i>de jure</i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe">William Howe↗︎︎</a> earlier exerted sufficient authority throughout Anglophone America that he ought to be recognized as the first President <i>de facto</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>de jure/de facto</i> distinction is key to understanding systematic social institutions. A non-systematic institution (such as a hunter-gatherer band) has no <i>de jure</i> aspect; a systematic one does, by definition. However, every systematic institution also has a <i>de facto</i> aspect, which is more or less discordant with the <i>de jure</i> one. The relationship between the two is always nebulous: complex, variable, and ambiguous.</p>
<p>To understand a systematic social institution, you have to analyze both aspects, plus their relationship. It is often true, though, that the <i>de facto</i> aspect is the one that primarily matters. For example, the <i>de jure</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Syria">Constitution of Syria↗︎︎</a> states that “The political system is based on the principle of political pluralism, and rule is only obtained and exercised democratically through voting,” but the facts on the ground suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for someone to be President <i>de facto</i> but not <i>de jure</i>, for any of several reasons. For instance, if the <i>de jure</i> President is non-functional, but it would be inconvenient to remove them from office <i>de jure</i>, someone else may do the job <i>de facto</i>. Some mainstream historians consider <a href="http://www.woodrowwilson.org/assets/docs/edith%20wilson.pdf">Edith Wilson↗︎︎</a> to have been the <i>de facto</i> President of the United States for a year and a half, after her husband Woodrow’s incapacitating stroke. </p>
<p>Another common reason is that the supposed country of which someone is <i>de facto</i> President is new, and only a <i>de facto</i> entity itself. Leonid Tibilov is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Ossetia">currently described↗︎︎</a> as the “<i>de facto</i> President of South Ossetia” because South Ossetia is only a “partially recognized state.” <i>De jure</i>, it is nebulous whether South Ossetia even exists, and <i>de facto</i> it is nebulous whether it is a genuine state or a Russian puppet. However, Tibilov exerts sufficient authority throughout the territory of the supposed state that he ought to be recognized as the <i>de facto</i> President.</p>
<p>Similarly, perhaps, William Howe? He was Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in America from 1775 to 1778. It is nebulous whether the United States existed then either <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>. However, Howe was the most powerful man in America for much of the period. Should he be considered <i>de facto</i> President?</p>
<p>No, that would be silly. But why? You will now be unsurprised to hear that this is “a matter of judgement, with unbounded considerations that may be relevant.” Here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>The American President is head of government, and subordinate to no one other than the citizens collectively. Howe was several levels down in the British military chain of command, which was in turn subordinate to Parliament and the King.</li>
<li>Although the American President is Commander-in-Chief, the Presidency is primarily a civil, not military, office. Howe made no attempt to run a civil government; his activity was purely military.</li>
<li>Britain, and so Howe, did not recognize a unified political entity in North America, only a collection of colonies. Howe couldn’t hold an office, even <i>de facto</i>, in an entity that neither he nor his superiors considered to exit.</li>
<li>The term “President” was rarely, if ever, applied to heads of governments before the office was created by the United States Constitutional Convention, a decade after Howe left. Calling him “President” would be anachronistic. If Howe were considered <i>de facto</i> head of an American government, he should be called a “Prince” or “Governor” or something.</li>
</ul>

<li>Some things have some finite meaning, but nothing is <em>ultimately</em> meaningful.</li>
<li>Some things (food, sex, survival) obviously have materialistic meanings to us as animals; but “higher” meanings are pious fantasies or lies.</li>
<li>Nothing is <em>inherently</em> meaningful. Objects don’t have meanings inside them, as essences; physics doesn’t support that.</li>

<li>Subjective “meanings” are relative to the observer. There’s no way to resolve disagreements about them, so they aren’t good for anything.</li>
<li>Space aliens might have completely different ideas about what counts as meaningful, which shows nothing is really meaningful at all.</li>
<li>You can’t <em>prove</em> anything is actually meaningful.</li>

<li>Some things falsely seem meaningful, but when viewed from the perspective of the universe <em>as a whole</em>, they are revealed to be meaningless.</li>
<li>Some things in life—its contents—seem meaningful; but looking at your life <em>as a whole</em>, you realize they don’t add up, and it’s meaningless.</li>
<li>When you think about why things seem meaningful, <em>in the final analysis</em>, you realize they aren’t meaningful after all.</li>
<li>To see what is really meaningful, you’d have to stand outside the universe, like God. But there is no God, and we can’t do that.</li>
<li>Subatomic particles have no meaning, and everything is made of subatomic particles, and nothing adds meaning to them, so there’s no meaning.</li>
<li>Everyone used to believe in spirits, but we couldn’t measure them, and we now know they don’t exist. Same for meanings.</li>
<li>Meanings would have to be made of some non-material substance, but there’s strong evidence nothing like that exists.</li>
<li>Meanings would imply mind/body dualism, which we know is wrong. Science shows that consciousness is just a neurochemical process.</li>
<li>There’s no credible theory that explains how meaning could actually work.</li>
<li>We know how “meaning” works—it’s just produced by neurons—so it doesn’t actually exist.</li>
<li>We hallucinate meaning as a result of the evolution of the brain, but evolution is a random, meaningless process, so meaning is illusory.</li>
<li>There was no meaning in the universe at the moment of the Big Bang, and there’s no process that adds meaning, so there’s no meaning now.</li>
<li>You can’t prove anything is worth living for. Life is mostly suffering, and has no real value.</li>
<li>Meanings are just made-up, like stories. They’re not real.</li>
<li>Sure, you could choose to label some things “meaningful,” but that doesn’t mean anything. You could call some things “yixxy” too.</li>
<li>You can’t define “meaning,” so it doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>Any argument that something is meaningful would have to justify it in terms of the meaningfulness of something else. But this can’t work; either there is an infinite regress, or it’s circular, or you come to something whose meaningfulness can’t be justified.</li>

<p class="intro_para">Across centuries and continents, mountains are major sources of meaning—of inspiration and insight—for human beings. Why is that?</p>
<!--break-->
<p>The color scheme of this web site—cobalt blue, dark green, and golden brown—was inspired by the tree in the photograph above. It stands on a desert mountain, ten thousand feet above sea level, within walking distance of my home. It is highly meaningful—to me.</p>
<p>I love mountains; I live and walk among them when I can.</p>
<p>I don’t know why mountains matter. Many reasons, maybe. This metablog post collects some observations and speculations.</p>

<p>I was inspired to write this by “<a href="https://theviewfromhellyes.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/the-mountain/">The Mountain↗︎︎</a>,” a recent post by Sarah Perry on her blog <cite>The View From Hell [Yes]: the search for patterns and the thickening of meaning</cite>. She thinks and writes, brilliantly, about many of the same topics I do.</p>
<p>She points out that among William James’ collection of others’ accounts of mystical experiences, many occurred in mountains. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period of intimate communion with the divine. These meetings came unasked and unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the <strong>temporary obliteration of the conventionalities</strong> which usually surround and cover my life…. Once it was when from <strong>the summit of a high mountain</strong> I looked over a gashed and corrugated landscape extending to a long convex of ocean that ascended to the horizon, and again from the same point when I could see nothing beneath me but a <strong>boundless expanse of white cloud</strong>, on the blown surface of which a few high peaks, including the one I was on, seemed plunging about as if they were dragging their anchors. What I felt on these occasions was a temporary <strong>loss of my own identity</strong>, accompanied by an illumination which revealed to me a <strong>deeper significance</strong> than I had been wont to attach to life.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_xlakzs7" id="extra29_footnoteref1_xlakzs7" title="Anonymous source quoted in William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience. Emphasis added by me.">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was written by a Christian, but sounds quite Zen, or perhaps Taoist.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_72tnhyz" id="extra29_footnoteref2_72tnhyz" title="Direct influence is possible. Buddhism was fashionable and widely-professed among hip American intellectuals in the 1890s (an interestingly little-known fact). James published in 1902, and described this informant only as “a man aged twenty-seven.” But then, direct influence in the opposite direction is also possible. This account sounds even more Romantic than it does Christian or Zen; and what we now know as “Zen” extensively incorporates European Romantic themes. The image at the head of this section, Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, is famous as a paradigm of Romanticism. I suspect the account quoted by James may have been influenced by the painting.">2</a></p>

<p>Will Buckingham, another of my favorite thinker-writers, has <a href="http://willbuckingham.com/great-images-non-objects-and-fog/">recommended and reflected on↗︎︎</a> a remarkable book: François Julien’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226415317/?tag=meaningness-20">The Great Image Has No Form, or On the Nonobject through Painting↗︎︎</a>. It is about cloudiness, both as reality and metaphor for non-object-ness, expressed in Chinese painting and Chinese philosophy. It is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>about vagueness, about that which is indistinct, about the mist and fog that swirls through Chinese painting, about the <strong>mountains</strong> that simultaneously arise out of, and are dissolved into, the cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#chap9">Nebulosity</a> (literally “cloudiness”) is the first concept of <cite>Meaningness</cite>. Second, my book examines the <a href="#chap95">nebulosity of boundaries</a>.

Two confused stances deny that nebulosity. <a href="#chap107">True self</a> hardens the self-other boundary, as in the dualist conception of the soul. <a href="#chap108">Selflessness</a> rejects the self as harmful, or rejects the distinction between self and other. Selfless attitudes are typical of ascetic philosophies, such as <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/11/22/renunciation-in-buddhism/">most traditional Buddhism↗︎︎</a>.</p>
<p>Self and other are never either perfectly distinct nor perfectly unified; and so the self is not such a problem. Buckingham quotes Julien:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003ZDNYWA/?tag=meaningness-20">Zhuangzi↗︎︎</a> teaches us to de-occupy ourselves, but not because the “self” is detestable and we must flee it or ascetically deny it, but because we need to recover from the consistency of the subject, to rid ourselves of it and “forget” it, in the terms of the Zhuangzi… in such a way that we no longer have to posit the world as an object opposite us, to be known and manipulated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mystical mountaintop revelations often involve “a temporary loss of one’s own identity, accompanied by an illumination which reveals a deeper significance.” But that identity was never more than a “conventionality”; a taken-for-granted idea that does not accurately represent typical felt experience—if we bothered to check. Buckingham writes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the deeply strange German philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, suggests that most of the time our experience is simply not that of being a subject, separated off from the world, confronting a world of objects that is opposite us. We only become a subject (“I”) looking at an object (“a tree”, perhaps) when somebody says “what are you up to?” and we say, “Oh, I’m looking at a tree…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a mountain-shaking mystical epiphany, no <em>peak</em> experience, but quite ordinary. That is a major theme in Martin Heidegger’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B928VUE/?tag=meaningness-20">Being and Time↗︎︎</a>, a work that Buckingham, Perry, and I all cite as formative inspiration for our thinking.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote4_js6o5g1" id="extra29_footnoteref4_js6o5g1" title="I don’t know whether Rosenzweig influenced Heidegger. I do know that Heidegger and 20th century Zen did both influence each other.">4</a></p>
<p>Heidegger’s example is a carpenter using a hammer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We achieve our closest relationship with a hammer not by looking at it, or by some detached theoretical study of it, but by manipulating it. While engaged in trouble-free hammering, the skilled carpenter has no conscious recognition of the hammer, the nails, or the work-bench, as independent objects, in the way that one would if one simply stood back and thought about them.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only is the hammer not part of the engaged carpenter’s world, neither is the carpenter. The carpenter becomes so absorbed in his activity that he has no awareness of himself as a subject over and against a world of objects. There are no subjects and no objects; there is only the experience of the ongoing task (e.g., hammering).<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote5_zwmkufe" id="extra29_footnoteref5_zwmkufe" title="This is a paraphrase of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on Heidegger. Being and Time is virtually unreadable. The Stanford Encyclopedia is not all that readable, either, so I’ve edited it for concision and clarity. ">5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not that “the boundary between self and other breaks down”; it is that the distinction is irrelevant and useless here. So it is no more present than the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky, or between reptiles and amphibians.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_flow">Flow, on and off the path</h2>
<p>Perry’s post describes running on specific mountain paths in Los Angeles. Of one, she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I find it very difficult not to stick my arms out airplane-style on this part of the run, out of pure joy…. The descent begins gently, but quickly gets steep, so that maintaining a running pace requires full concentration, frequently producing the mental state known as “flow.” It is the most thrilling part of the run, resembling what I imagine to be the experience of steering a Star Wars air motorcycle through the forest. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mountain running is, for me also, one of the most reliable ways to induce flow. It requires extended physical exertion, close proprioceptive attention to the workings of one’s own body and to the irregularity of the ground, rhythmic movement, and enjoyment of natural beauty. All contribute to the flow state, which is quite like Heidegger’s description of expert hammering. Flow is non-conceptual, but not a state of mindless automatism; rather, of heightened awareness.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote6_gspe41a" id="extra29_footnoteref6_gspe41a" title="As the Stanford Encyclopedia article puts it: “Crucially, it does not follow from this analysis that Dasein’s behaviour in such contexts is automatic, in the sense of there being no awareness present at all, but rather that the awareness that is present (what Heidegger calls circumspection) is non-subject-object in form.”">6</a></p>
<p>I’ve written about the connections <a href="https://vividness.live/2012/06/27/tantra-and-flow/">between flow and Buddhist Tantric ritual↗︎︎</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Flow” occurs when you are totally immersed in an activity that consumes your full attention and skill. It’s described by athletes as being “in the zone,” and by musicians as being “in the groove.” It’s highly enjoyable; often the best thing in life.</p>
<p>Flow is closely related to Buddhist Tantra; but there are important differences. These help explain the “path” aspect, or methods, of tantra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://approachingaro.org/on-the-spiritual-path">Elsewhere↗︎︎</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiritual paths are not much like the paths in a garden or city park. Instead, I want to compare them with hiking trails in remote, rugged mountains. The terrain of religious experience can sometimes be uncertain, difficult, or even dangerous, making this an apt analogy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being on a path can put you in the groove. I find mountain hiking most interesting when I’m <em>off</em> the path, though. This is also a valuable metaphor for more difficult explorations of meaningness. I’ve written about that <a href="https://approachingaro.org/off-the-spiritual-path">here↗︎︎</a> and <a href="https://vividness.live/2013/12/12/emptiness-zen-tantra-dzogchen/#dzogchen">here↗︎︎</a>. I’d like to say more now, but it would risk our getting lost…<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote7_ps8saj7" id="extra29_footnoteref7_ps8saj7" title="One of Heidegger’s major works is titled Off the Beaten Track. Like me, he did most of his thinking while hiking, and “path” was a complex and productive metaphor for him too.">7</a></p>
<h2 id="extra29_vastness">Vastness</h2>
<p>Mountains are big. Bigger mountains are better; more meaningful.</p>
<p>The sky is big. It is bigger in the mountains. You can see, in the photo at the head of this page, how at ten thousand feet the thinner atmosphere makes the sky darker blue.</p>
<p>Experiencing vastness often transforms into an intense experience of religious meaningfulness. I do not know why. No one can say what the meaning is.</p>
<p>The emperor of China asked Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen: “What is the first principle of the holy truth?”<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote8_7y4xx9r" id="extra29_footnoteref8_7y4xx9r" title="I’ve written about this story before.">8</a></p>
<p>Bodhidharma replied:</p>
<p style="color:#0F31A0;font-family:athelas-1;font-size:42px;font-style:italic;padding:0">No holiness —</p>
<p style="color:#0F31A0;font-family:athelas-1;font-size:128px;font-style:italic;padding:0;margin-top:-18px;margin-bottom:-18px">Vastness!</p>
<p>The emperor did not understand. So Bodhidharma wandered off into the mountains; and could not be found.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_sky">So I can see the sky</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when asked why I meditate, I say: “so I can see the sky.”</p>
<p>I suspect many people rarely see the sky. Perhaps some people never <em>have</em> seen the sky.</p>
<p>When I don’t meditate, what I see—if anything—is “the sky,” not the sky. “The sky” is not interesting. The sky is vastly larger than “the sky.” It is too big to see unless I meditate.</p>
<p>Heidegger wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sky is the vaulting path of the sun, the course of the changing moon, the wandering glitter of the stars, the year’s seasons and their changes, the light and dusk of day, the gloom and glow of night, the clemency and inclemency of the weather, the drifting clouds and blue depth of the ether.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stripping out his purple prose, this boils down to “there’s some weather and stuff up there.” Perhaps not a revelation? But maybe his point was: look at it!</p>
<p>There’s no point looking at “the sky”; all you’ll see is weather and stuff, and you’ve seen that a million times. If you look at the sky, you’ll see something you’ve never seen before.</p>
<p>… That’s not quite true. (I’ll explain why, later.) So let’s try again.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_earth">Sky and earth</h2>
<p>Seeing the sky allows you also to see the earth.</p>
<p>The sky is above you; the earth is beneath you. You might not consider this news. It’s treated as a profound truth by several intriguing systems of meaning, however: Heidegger’s, <a href="https://vividness.live/2014/01/09/shambhala-training-was-secular-vajrayana/">Shambhala↗︎︎</a>, Neopaganism, and Vico’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002XHNO2O/?tag=meaningness-20">New Science↗︎︎</a>—to name a few.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vico regards the first men as beginning to think by becoming aware of the sky. They called the sky Jove, the first god. This awareness of the sky is the first distinction of thought. Through it a distinction of sky and earth can be made. Such a distinction allows the first men to live in a world.</p>
<p>Jove is not the name for the whole in the sense of all there is, everything. The thought of Jove allows not only the first men’s eyes to turn toward the sky for the first time, but also allows them to discover that they are of the earth.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote9_4xi77ja" id="extra29_footnoteref9_4xi77ja" title="Quote lightly paraphrased from Donald Phillip Verene’s Vico’s Science of Imagination, p. 84.">9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Jove is <em>not</em> the name for the whole in the sense of all there is, everything.” That would be monism. It is because earth and sky are different that we live in a world—not in undifferentiated milky Oneness. We live on the earth, and are <em>of</em> the earth, not of the sky. Monism wrongly denies <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss5" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'pattern', 'gloss5')" title="Pattern is the quality that makes phenomena interpretable: regularity, causality, distinctness, form. [Click for details.]">pattern</a>—the inseparable consort of nebulosity.</p>
<p>Buckingham writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fog hung over the lake. In the distance—it was impossible to say how far off—were the dark smudges of trees, appearing through the mist and disappearing again. I tried to trace the point at which the ripples of the water faded into the fog, the dividing line between one thing and another; but found all such attempts to draw boundaries came to nothing.</p>
<p>And yet, this was not some kind of notion of oneness along the lines of certain <a href="#extra27">vacuous new-age ideas</a>, because this itself is a notion that itself is far too clear, far too distinct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monism is an <a href="https://approachingaro.org/aro-gter-emptiness">extreme view↗︎︎</a>; the absolutist, hard-edged, aggressive denial of the obvious reality of differences. That is its appeal: it promises to annihilate all the troublesome, complicated details that make life difficult.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_noreason">No reason for a mountain</h2>
<p>Looking at mass-produced objects in artificial environments, you see mainly labels, concepts, functions, “conventionalities”; and this becomes a habit. Even walking in a city park, you see “trees.” They are there for a reason; <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">they are legible↗︎︎</a>, catalogued, rationalized, managed.</p>
<p>If you walk long enough on a mountain, the labeling habit—mainly useless there—falls away. The effort of <em>running</em> on a mountain accelerates that dissolution; you don’t have enough oxygen for both.</p>
<p>Then you do not see “a tree”; you see a tree.</p>
<p>It was seeing the specific tree pictured at the top of this page that led to my color scheme. There is nothing special about that tree. However, I saw <em>it</em>, not “a tree”; and that was meaningful at the time. It was, in fact, an experience of <a href="#chap141">non-referential sacredness</a>.</p>
<p>Buddhist, Hindu, Romantic, and New Age monisms cast concepts as the enemy. Intellectual distinctions—reasons, labels, conventionalities—are the source of all our trouble, they say. Murder your discursive mind and just perceive reality directly.</p>
<p>This springs from an important truth, but it is another simplistic, absolutist stance, and wrong for several reasons. One is that the boundary between concept and perception is itself nebulous. The no-thought school of mysticism implicitly asserts that concepts are <em>themselves</em> a clear and distinct category. It imagines that there is, at any moment, a fact-of-the-matter about whether or not you are applying a concept, and which one. And this is not true.</p>
<p>Do you see “a mountain”—a concept—or a mountain? These can be very different, but not always. We might say that this difference is a matter of degree, not kind; or that it is sometimes indistinct, like the non-boundary between the lake and the fog. (Which is why what I said about seeing and not-seeing the sky is not quite true.)</p>
<p>Buckingham continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was rather a question, as I stood by the lake, of a kind of de-occupying, de-positing, de-representing… It was a matter, that is to say—in this sketched world of blur and indistinct boundaries—of becoming sketchy myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operation of one’s self, the machinery of perception, the application of concepts—these too are a borderless interplay of pattern and nebulosity. As Julien said, “we need to recover from the consistency of the subject”—the idealized and impossible coherence of the self. </p>
<h2 id="extra29_overturning">Overturning form and emptiness</h2>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">
<img alt="Japanese sumi-e ink painting: mountain above, sky below" height="681" src="https://meaningness.com/images/mn/mountain_above_sky_below.jpg" width="511"/>
</figure>
<p>When you stand high on a steep mountain slope, looking out over the gulf, you see vast space <em>beneath</em> you; turning, you see vast earth <em>above</em> you. This inversion induces vertigo, which stops the mind.</p>
<p>The Chinese landscape painting tradition that Julien describes accomplishes the same overturning by girdling mountains’ midparts in modesty: clouds below, rocks above.</p>
<p>In Zen it is said: “First there is a mountain; then there is no mountain; and then there is a mountain.” The mountain is form; no-mountain is emptiness. The mountain after no-mountain is the same mountain, and not the same. (I wrote about this at length in “<a href="https://vividness.live/2013/12/12/emptiness-zen-tantra-dzogchen/">Beyond emptiness: Zen, Tantra, and Dzogchen↗︎︎</a>.”)</p>
<p>The sky, symbolically, is emptiness. We are form; we are of earth; but in non-ordinary experience, we can upset the two and become the sky.</p>
<p><em>Dwelling</em> in the sky is <a href="https://vividness.live/2012/05/03/your-self-is-not-a-spiritual-obstacle/#skygod">probably not possible↗︎︎</a>, and certainly not useful. There’s nothing to do up there. We return to form; but we are not the same, because earth remains mixed with sky. Mixed not (<i>pace</i> certain Tibetan texts) like water and milk. Form and emptiness, rather, bleed into each other, irregularly, like the margins of mountain and sky in a <i>sumi-e</i> inkwash painting.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_withoutclouds">Mountains without clouds</h2>
<p>Clouds in mountains are a misleading metaphor, though. Clouds are adventitious and contingent. </p>
<p>The metaphor suggests a limitation of epistemic access: that we cannot see the mountains properly because clouds are in the way.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote10_s597bmh" id="extra29_footnoteref10_s597bmh" title="This might be interpreted in terms of Kant’s thing-in-itself, or the masking of reality by conceptual categories. Both these are unconnected (I hope) with “nebulosity” as I use the term.">10</a> However, a sunny day can burn away the fog. Even if clouds were <em>always</em> present, the invisible reality of the mountain remains.</p>
<p>Nebulosity, in the sense of <cite>Meaningness</cite>, is an ontological fact, not an epistemic one. The point is not that we cannot find boundaries, but that they are not objectively determined.</p>
<p>The mountains in the photograph at the top of this page are in a high-altitude desert. Trees and rocks stand out in the sun, brilliant and sharp-edged. It is hard to miss their specificity and uniqueness. Are we seeing them shorn of nebulosity? Not at all.</p>
<p>If you think of a rock now, reading this, what comes to mind is probably a not a rock, but a concept of a rock. Your image may be of a domesticated rock; perhaps even an indoor rock. Tame rocks are tidy and well-defined. They have clear and distinct surfaces; boundaries. Usually they are taken from rivers or beaches; they are water-polished.</p>
<p>The wild rocks high on mountainsides are not there for any reason. They just are; and so you can see them.</p>
<figure class="ctrimg_not_first">

</figure>
<p>The rocks beneath my tree are granodiorite: an unusually hard mineral, similar to granite, formed under vast pressure many miles underground. If you pick one up and look closely, you will see that many surface irregularities are loose. Some bits, little larger than dust, come off just if you blow gently on them. Some grains you can rub off with your thumb; some flakes you can pry off with a fingernail. Which are “part of the rock” and which are “adhering bits of dirt”? There is no answer to this question. There is no fact-of-the-matter about where the rock ends and its matrix of soil begins. The sharp-edgedness of a desert rock is limited, when you actually look. Even rocks are nebulous.</p>
<h2 id="extra29_real">Mountains are exceptionally real</h2>
<p>Nebulosity is not a state of incomplete existence. Metaphysicists have <a href="#chap96">often confused themselves about this</a>. Rocks are nebulous, but unusually real.</p>

<p>Throughout life, every experience, moment-to-moment, is accompanied by a constant undertone of “how real this is.” (I do not know why.) Everyday life is mostly modestly real. Sometimes, when depressed, it <a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/philosophical-zombies-fMRI#degreesofzombitude">seems unreal↗︎︎</a>. Sometimes, at peak moments, life seems exceptionally real.</p>
<p>The desert mountain is silent, but it is not the quiet of peace. It is the silence of coruscating energy, like a wound spring; like a gigantic electric guitar chord that is overwhelming yet inaudible.</p>
<p>The vastness, precision, specificity, and energy of the mountain induces a sense of <em>intense realness</em>, which creates great meaningfulness.</p>

<p class="intro_para">The New Age promised an Aquarian Revolution: a total, global transformation of consciousness. It has not delivered, as yet.  I suspect, on the contrary, that the Age of Aquarius is drawing to an end.</p>
<p>The New Age was a response to particular historical circumstances that have passed.  Understanding its appeal and limits may cast light on the emerging “pop spirituality,” which is similar in some ways and critically different in others.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote1_l0hql4z" id="extra29_footnoteref1_l0hql4z" title="What I write in this page is impressionistic, and unsupported by any specific evidence.  This may be dangerously careless.  On the other hand, I am not really interested in the New Age for its own sake.  Instead, my goal here is to differentiate it from what I take to be its successor, what I am calling “contemporary pop spirituality,” about which I’ll say much more later.">1</a></p>
<!--break-->
<p>The New Age developed as an alternative to the restrictive, consensus 1950s world-view the Baby Boomers grew up in. In religion, the only 1950s choices were Christian and Jewish sects. In politics and economics, the only choices were capitalism and communism, which were seen as monolithic opposing ideologies. In society, the ideal was a nuclear two-parent heterosexual family with 2.3 children.  Advances in science, technology, and industrial production made the idea of material Progress as an inevitable force compelling.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote2_7bdocbg" id="extra29_footnoteref2_7bdocbg" title="Of course, there were some people who rejected all these. However, they were a tiny marginal minority; whereas by 1990 alternatives had mass appeal.">2</a></p>
<p>Although some of these systems are superficially opposed, they all are forms of <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss0" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'eternalism', 'gloss0')" title="Eternalism is the stance that sees the meaning of everything as fixed by an external principle, such as God or a Cosmic Plan.  It forms a false dichotomy with nihilism, which regards everything as meaningless.  The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">eternalist</a> <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss1" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'dualism', 'gloss1')" title="Dualism is the confused stance that everyone and everything is a clearly distinct, separate, independently-existing individual. [Click for details.]">dualism</a>.  “Eternalist” means that they see meaning as provided by an unchanging transcendent order.  “Dualist” means that they uphold various hard-line distinctions. People are individuals clearly separated from each other; from nature; and from divinity. Definite choices must be made between competing systems, which must be either right or wrong. Social groups—classes, countries, races—are immutably different, and inherently conflicting.</p>
<p>Many in the Baby Boom generation rejected this consensus, and sought other systems.  Mostly, the alternatives they found were forms of eternalist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss2" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'monism', 'gloss2')" title="Monism is the  confused stance that All is One; that my true self is mystically identified with the Cosmic Plan; that all religions and philosophies point to the same ultimate truth. [Click for details.]">monism</a>.  These systems also see meaning as derived from a transcendent order (eternalism), but assert that the supposed separations of dualism are illusory (monism). Among dozens of other systems, astrology, parapsychology, eco-spirituality, quantum mysticism, and naturopathy—despite addressing quite different subjects—share this underlying philosophy. The phrase “New Age” was popularized as an umbrella term to cover them all.  Despite the “New” in the name, these systems mainly developed in Nineteenth Century Europe, influenced by <a href="#extra1">German Romantic Idealism</a>.</p>
<p>These monist systems are based on accurate insights into the errors of dualism. None of the separations dualism imposes are absolute.  Insisting that these lines cannot be crossed is a major source of misery.</p>
<p>Alternative models of healing were a major part of the New Age’s appeal.  Mainstream medicine’s ideology is dualist <a class="glossed" id="extra29_gloss3" onclick="simple_glossary_onclick(event, 'nihilism', 'gloss3')" title="Nihilism is the stance that regards everything as meaningless.  It forms a false dichotomy with eternalism, which sees everything as having a fixed meaning. The stance of meaningness recognizes the fluid mixture of meaningfulness and meaninglessness in everything. [Click for details.]">nihilism</a>. The body is a machine that sometimes needs adjustment; the mind is entirely separate from it and irrelevant to its function; spirit is non-existent.  Conversely, dualist eternalism sees the body as inherently morally corrupt; something to be disciplined, neglected, or repudiated.  Both approaches came to seem quite wrong.</p>
<a id="extra29_problem" name="problem"><h2>The problem with the New Age</h2></a>
<p>The problem with the New Age is that you have to believe and do stupid things.  Mostly its specific systems are silly, if you take details seriously.  This has limited its growth.  Most people have little patience with crystal healing and angelic spirit guides from Atlantis.  (Or whatever is happening in the <a href="http://failblog.org/">FAIL photo↗︎︎</a> at the top of this page.<a class="see-footnote" href="#extra29_footnote3_lfr1re2" id="extra29_footnoteref3_lfr1re2" title="This is an internet joke meme: superimposing “FAIL” on images illustrating idiocy.">3</a>)</p>
<p>A few New Age adherents are seriously committed to a specific system.  They spend years studying a complex, intellectually pretentious theoretical framework.</p>
<p>Most New Agers, though, hold to individual systems only lightly.  They flit from one alternative healing method to another; they claim to believe in several incompatible religions at once; their actual lifestyles have little to do with their professed ideals.</p>
<p>For most New Agers, details are irrelevant.  The specifics are, in fact, Nineteenth Century historical baggage.</p>
<p>For the client of a New Age healer, the mumbo-jumbo doesn’t matter.  What is important is the healer’s recognition of the client as a whole person—body, mind, and spirit—who is also inseparably connected with all living beings.  What qualifies the healer is not conceptual knowledge of astrological charts, maps of energy channels, or the pairwise interactions of flower essences.  What qualifies the healer is her deep intuitive connection to the Cosmos as a whole.</p>
<p>Allegiance to the New Age is based on rejection of the only apparent alternatives: eternalist and nihilist dualism.  If those are wrong, it may seem that monism must be right; and until recently, the New Age was the only available form of monism.</p>
<p>The sticking point is that it is not possible to participate in the New Age without adopting (however lightly or temporarily) one or more of the silly systems that make it up.</p>
