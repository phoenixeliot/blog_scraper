<p><em>Ward is the second work in the Parahumans series, and reading</em> <strong><a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/">Worm</a></strong> <em>first is strongly recommended. A lot of this won’t make sense otherwise and if you do find yourself a fan of the universe, the spoilers in Ward will affect the reading of the other work.</em></p>
<p><em>Ward is not recommended for young or sensitive readers.</em></p>
<p><em>The Glow-worm chapters were a teaser event leading up to Worm 2. They aren’t required reading but offer flavor and additional angles by which to view certain characters. They take the form of forum posts, chat conversations and emails.</em></p>
<p><em>They’re best described as a kind of a post-epilogue, pseudo-prologue bridge between the series. Those who read them on the Worm site shouldn’t feel the need to read them again &mdash; they’re included here for convenience’s sake, with a few readability improvements.</em></p>

<p>To call the efforts of everyone involved heroic would be grossly understating things. This IT project required the efforts of seventy eight PHO staff members, employees of Stateside Online, former officials of the US government, former members of the United States space program, members of international space programs, the Guild (Masamune in particular), and numerous independent experts and volunteers. At a time when we’re all stretched thin and there is an incredible amount of work still to be done, seven hundred and eight individuals devoted spare time and valuable resources to get us and six other partners online.</p>
<p>Things will be clunky and frustrating. For most, with congestion being what it is, things will be slow enough that people can get a cup of coffee and come back to find the page hasn’t fully loaded. We’ve stripped away a bit of the polish and the gloss: the header images, badge graphics and the ability to include video or images are gone for now, to keep things simple and easy. We will be moderating very carefully to ensure nobody disrupts anyone’s ability to access the site. It will be painful. Help each other, be patient, and contribute the best you can.</p>
<p>In so many ways, things will be frustrating, slow, and painful. Care, helpfulness, patience, and contribution will make literal worlds of difference. In so many ways.</p>
<p>But we’re back. Stay tuned for bigger, better things. Bear with us as we sort through it all.</p>

@ Dgators &mdash; Generally, you want to be careful because you won’t get any updates to OS360 or other PC OSes, no patches to your phone. There is no tech support and there is little recourse for anyone hit with malware. Plausibly there’s a lot of desperate people out there who see that the defenses are down and we’re in early days. It’s probably easier for someone to come up with new means of attack than it is for anyone to roll out a proper patch. Presumably if they wanted to infect systems or get access they would want to do it now when it would probably let them get access to things that follow.</p>

Library project is moving ahead! Plenty of people brought laptops and phones and we’re piecing things together by loading from cache. It is more zombie net than real net but we’re finding things. There are more coming but people want to delete their search histories before they hand their computers over. Because porn.</p>

I have access through the portal at the east of the city. When I go through I’ve been doing loops through the old neighborhoods to see what I can scrounge up. If you need something to fill major gaps I can try looking. If not, I’m going to see if I can round off my collection. Would be nice to have a good excuse if I get accused of smuggling or looting tho</p>

<p><em>[Transcribed from print] Conrad James Freed and his family could tell a harrowing tale of their trip across Earth Bet’s America. They have finally reached the Northeastern Bet-Gimel portal, hearing rumor of wait times, only to be told there is a possibility they may not be allowed in at all.</em></p>
<p><em>They had been driving, hitchhiking and hiking for four months.</em></p>
<p><em>“They aren’t giving us answers,” he told Bulletin News on Saturday.</em></p>
<p><em>Their family had been trying to subsist on their rural property in Wisconsin when the weather took a turn for the worse. Though it was June, Conrad says he saw snow falling on the fields where he had planted the first crop of the season.</em></p>
<p><em>Two days later, there would be a knock at his door. Authorities had flown over and saw the lights of his house. They warned him the snowfall and the groundwater was contaminated. It would be the last straw, as the unseasonably cold weather had cut into the already thin initial harvest.</em></p>
<p><em>Conrad says the authorities wanted him and his family to leave right away. “They didn’t give us a chance to pack. One of the men even grabbed my daughter. He bruised her wrist, he held her so hard. I promised I would cooperate if he would only give us five minutes. I was in shock.”</em></p>
<p><em>He and his wife decided to make the harrowing trip to the nearest portal without the assistance of authorities, a decision he says he made on the spur of the moment, after the manhandling of his daughter and the manner in which he was forced from his home. “I came to regret that decision.”</em></p>
<p><em>Conrad’s story is far from unique. Evacuation is still underway even two years and two months after Gold Morning. Where things took a turn for the worse for Conrad and his family, and where an undisclosed change in policy may affect uncountable refugees from Earth Bet, is that the border agents have apparently ceased processing refugees.</em> </p>
<p><em>Tensions are rising and as the number of people in the refugee settlement slowly climbs and resources are stretched thinner, people are speaking out. Conrad says, “We know there is more than enough space on the other side. We see people coming and going but they won’t let us through or even meet us to answer our questions. We’re willing to settle outside of the city. I know agriculture and I know they desperately need farmers. Even if they give us a minimum of supplies and tools, it has to be better than this.”</em></p>
<p><em>Bulletin News reached out to authorities and received no response.</em></p>
<p>&mdash;Thoughts? Anyone know what was up?</p>

They’re letting people through again now, and they’re letting a lot through. Speculation might have been right. Article might have been more about political pressure than anything else.</p>

Official word is that they wanted to pause and get organized so they could double the number of people coming through. Doesn’t make a lot of sense when it comes to their silence until now.</p>

lots of capes stationed at the portal.<br>
some thinkers like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Squint</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Danger Zone</strong></span> are there.<br>
pretty sure if you watch how they rotate in and out there will always be one thinker on duty.<br>
screening refugees?</p>

</strong>@ Nakyak &mdash; could be. Could be that it means less need for pain in the ass background checks with internet running at 33K. Danger Zone sees likelihood a person commits violence to each and every person around them, recency, flavor of violence. Squint sees contraband, possible other hazards. Skip background check, move people along.</p>

</strong>Speaking of security, there was another thread where someone said something about rock &amp; a hard place? It’s apparently being talked about a lot among the refugees.</p>

<strong>Replied on August 17th, Y1<br>
</strong>@ Boosher &mdash; <strong>This</strong> article, search for Nancy Y’s statement. People traveling across the US to get to portals are being warned about multiple threats. Word on the capevine is that with everyone having pulled out, all former quarantine zones are breached. In the US and elsewhere. Nilbog is the one everyone knows about. He’s in custody, his children aren’t. If you’re paying attention to hero groups and their movements, they’re making lots of trips out. They’re tired and people say they’re aloof.<br>
I say they’re fighting a hard fight and they’re keeping their distance from public and media because they don’t want us to know it.</p>

</strong>they don’t want to tell us a lot of things. what even happened? the world ended and nobody is willing to explain.</p>

<strong>Replied on August 17th, Y1<br>
</strong>@ Boosher &mdash; a big part of what was being talked about in other similar articles was the threat of bandits, bad weather, the wasteland and chasms, unstoppable robot armies, the food shortages. Edit: Nutty beat me to it. Slow internet sucks. I think boaty is a good example of why they’re aloof. People want to assign blame. Assign the blame to the man who did this. In times of crisis, look to the people who are helping. Support them or try to be one of them.</p>

</strong>I agree for the most part, Point@, but it’s more complicated than that. I gotta side with boaty. We made a covenant with the capes. We put up with a lot. In exchange, they were supposed to protect us. It’s pretty clear they didn’t. Maybe it was impossible. That’s fine. But let’s not ignore that they broke their end of the contract. Let’s not ignore that the PRT is gone, we no longer have non-capes in charge of them, and they have more proportional power than ever. Let’s not ignore that they’re making a new PRT without any of the key rules that defined the last one. Less communication, no oversight.</p>

Posted on August 18th, Y1:</p>
<p>PHO is back on and they are letting the chats run. That’s where we usually meet, but I’ve been warned it’s choppy and slow. I’ll be there.</p>
<p>This took me three hours to just get started with. It’s hard.</p>
<p>It is with the heaviest of hearts that I inform you that Coiffure did pass. When Gold Morning arrived, we suspected something might have happened, given the reports. She was killed in one of the initial strikes on the East coast. She was a friend, a teammate, and she was a true hero. She elevated others around her to be better people by the standards she lived by.</p>
<p>Coiffure is survived by only her father. Her mother was one of my favorite adults. She was kind, she was cool, and she was a genuinely good mom to Coiffure. When we went back to school in the fall, she gave us really cool back to school supplies. It remains in my memory as one of the most randomly nice things a relative stranger has done for me.</p>
<p>You’ll also remember her siblings Arthur and Cal, though you might not remember their names. When the family came by, Arthur would be the one curled up in the big chair near the front desk, with one of his game things. Cal would be watching over his big brother’s shoulder. I always thought it was hilarious how uninterested they were in capes.</p>
<p>We can expect they all died instantaneously. I’ve talked to Coiffure’s father. I would suggest that if you happen to run into him, leave him be. He doesn’t want reminders.</p>
<p>Furcate decided to fight on that monumental day and that says so much when not everyone was brave enough to do that. Furcate was wild and tortured and beautiful. They were a handful and yet they rewarded us with ten positive things for every negative we had to overcome. I’d like to think they got something out of putting up with us in much the same way.</p>
<p>I want what I say here to be honest. I did not get along with Furcate the vast majority of the time. Furcate did not get along with me. I still respected them immensely. They said one word for every thousand the rest of us said and yet they could convey so much in their actions. I keep saying those things, using math like ‘ten times over’, but it’s so very Furcate. They overflowed, they swelled. The cup runneth over. I look back and I’m dazed by how much of a place they found in my heart and my thoughts.</p>
<p>It might be crass to say, but I don’t know if anyone’s going to have words for them. Scritch and Scratch were the closest thing we had to a nemesis. They had their scummy moments. They also kept to the rules. They were killed during one of the lulls in the fighting, by a group I won’t name.</p>
<p>The fates of Tribute, Boundless, Capricorn and Steamwheel are yet unknown. I hope you guys are okay.</p>
<p>I’m alive, obviously. Figurehead is alive but you all should know his issues with being controlled. The events really shook him. He’s retired in large part, he’ll be doing something capey, but he’s said he isn’t coming on PHO. He asked me to wish you all the best.</p>

<p>[A18 11:30:33] <strong>Cap:</strong> I get that<br>
[A18 11:30:35] <strong>Cap:</strong> doesn’t answer my question<br>
[A18 11:30:40] <strong>Cap:</strong> will it carry on? what happens?</p>
<p>[A18 11:43:50] Moonsong: It won’t. I don’t think so anyway. There’s a lot of hero teams out there and its hard for a sponsored team to get traction even without people feeling betrayed.</p>
<p>[A18 11:44:02] <strong>Cap:</strong> yeah</p>
<p>[A18 11:46:14] Moonsong: A lot of teams are gathering under the Wardens. PRT-like. They’re walking a fine line between emulating PRT and being PRT. Lots of teams under the umbrella. I’m not sure it’s working. I don’t know if I want to get on board with that. I don’t know if the others would.</p>
<p>[A18 11:46:23] <strong>Cap:</strong> that’s fair</p>
<p>[A18 11:47:50] Moonsong: I will always be a member of Reach. Even if the team has dissolved.</p>
<p>[A18 11:48:42] <strong>Cap:</strong> I like that<strong><br>
</strong>[A18 11:48:53] <strong>Cap:</strong> since when were you so good with words?</p>
<p>[A18 11:50:37] Moonsong: Since when did you pay attention to anyone but yourself?</p>
<p>[A18 11:50:43] <strong>Cap:</strong> …</p>
<p>[A18 11:51:12] Moonsong: ?</p>
<p>[A18 11:52:36] <strong>Cap:</strong> 45 minutes of something approaching civility has to be a record for us</p>
<p>[A18 11:52:57] Moonsong: I see. Yes. It could be.</p>
<p>[A18 11:53:06] <strong>Cap:</strong> I would have liked to keep that streak going<br>
[A18 11:53:20] <strong>Cap:</strong> oh well</p>
<p>[A18 11:54:31] Moonsong: Are you well, Tristan?</p>
<p>[A18 11:55:21] <strong>Cap:</strong> I see we’re going straight to the barbs</p>
<p>[A18 11:56:32] Moonsong: No barbs. I genuinely want to know.</p>
<p>[A18 11:57:14] <strong>Cap:</strong> how uncharacteristicaly nice of you</p>
<p>[A18 11:58:23] Moonsong: Do I need to worry about you?</p>
<p>[A18 11:58:45] <strong>Cap:</strong> no<br>
[A18 11:58:56] <strong>Cap:</strong> you “helped” more than enough</p>
<p>[A18 12:00:19] Moonsong: I don’t know.</p>
<p>[A18 12:01:08] <strong>Cap:</strong> don’t you?</p>
<p>[A18 12:02:07] Moonsong: I’ve spent a lot of time hoping you died.</p>
<p>[A18 12:03:34] <strong>Cap:</strong> WOW<br>
[A18 12:03:58] <strong>Cap:</strong> geez</p>
<p>[A18 12:04:06] Moonsong: *shrug*</p>
<p>[A18 12:05:27] <strong>Cap:</strong> geez. there is no humanity in there at all is there?<br>
[A18 12:05:51] <strong>Cap:</strong> just takes the world to end beforeI get a glimpse of the real you</p>
<p>[A18 12:06:45] Moonsong: Lets not pretend, Tristan.</p>
<p>[A18 12:07:01] <strong>Cap:</strong> pretend what?<br>
[A18 12:07:42] <strong>Cap:</strong> you decided you hated me before you ever got to know me<br>
[A18 12:08:37] <strong>Cap:</strong> you’re really your fathers daughter. two-faced. anyone reading between the lines can see what you really thought about furcate</p>
<p>[A18 12:10:39] Moonsong: I meant what I wrote.</p>
<p>[A18 12:11:47] <strong>Cap:</strong> a thinly veiled outline of furcates many problems<br>
[A18 12:11:56] <strong>Cap:</strong> you couldn’t resist saying you didn’t like them</p>
<p>[A18 12:11:23] Moonsong: Are you done?</p>
<p>[A18 12:12:13] <strong>Cap:</strong> you made furcate more miserable than anyone</p>
<p>[A18 12:12:26] Moonsong: Apparently not</p>
<p>[A18 12:12:29] <strong>Cap:</strong> you never once tried to understand them just like you never once tried to understand me<br>
[A18 12:13:12] <strong>Cap:</strong> you had your notions of how everyone was supposed to behave<br>
[A18 12:13:36] <strong>Cap:</strong> how everyone was supposed to be<br>
[A18 12:13:45] <strong>Cap:</strong> you know what they call people who come to judgment about people before they have the facts?<br>
[A18 12:14:19] <strong>Cap:</strong> the label applies, moonsong<br>
[A18 12:14:29] <strong>Cap:</strong> you wedged yourself into a situation you didn’t understand and you made it so much worse<br>
[A18 12:14:48] <strong>Cap:</strong> what guts me is you think you were right to do it.</p>
<p>[A18 12:16:39] Moonsong: I didn’t like furcate. I did love and respect him as a teammate.<br>
[A18 12:16:51] Moonsong: I damn well held him at the end. For a long time. I talked to him the entire time.<br>
[A18 12:18:23] Moonsong: Motherfucker.<br>
[A18 12:18:41] Moonsong: I’m crying now.<br>
[A18 12:19:04] Moonsong: And no. I don’t know if I was right, Tristan.</p>
<p>[A18 12:20:08] <strong>Cap:</strong> moonsong admitting she might be wrong? Did the world end or something?</p>
<p>[A18 12:21:12] Moonsong: Go fuck yourself, Tristan. That wound is too fresh.</p>
<p>[A18 12:22:13] <strong>Cap:</strong> …<br>
[A18 12:22:24] <strong>Cap:</strong> yeah<br>
[A18 12:22:29] <strong>Cap:</strong> I’ll own up to that</p>
<p>[A18 12:23:43] Moonsong: You’re admitting you’re wrong? What happened to you in these past few years?</p>
<p>[A18 12:23:50] <strong>Cap:</strong> not enough. not nearly enough.</p>
<p>[A18 12:24:48] Moonsong: Guess not. What a shame.</p>
<p>[A18 12:25:23] <strong>Cap:</strong> that wound is fresh in its own way<br>
[A18 12:25:56] <strong>Cap:</strong> just so you know</p>
<p>[A18 12:26:54] Moonsong: Alright.</p>
<p>[A18 12:27:45] <strong>Cap:</strong> fuck<br>
[A18 12:28:20] <strong>Cap:</strong> this is a mess. we should keep our distance</p>
<p>[A18 12:29:17] Moonsong: Do I need to come after you?</p>
<p>[A18 12:30:38] <strong>Cap:</strong> no<br>
[A18 12:30:57] <strong>Cap:</strong> fuck you. no<br>
[A18 12:31:40] <strong>Cap:</strong> what the fuck was that about not thinking you were right?<br>
[A18 12:31:48] <strong>Cap:</strong> don’t answer that. do me a favor and shut up for a second.<br>

<p>X29V5n: you’re the latino kid?</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: yeah. how does this work?</p>
<p>X29V5n: You into memorabilia then?</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: sure. memorabilia. I miss my old collection</p>
<p>X29V5n: The person who referred you should have explained most of it</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: some</p>
<p>X29V5n: Let’s say you’re into commemorative plates. Plate with a hero or a villian’s face on it. You care a lot about the plate and its delivery</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: sure</p>
<p>X29V5n: We ensure you get the result you want.<br>
X29V5n: Insurance</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: sounds like just what I need</p>
<p>X29V5n: We offer tiers. Different tiers for various degrees of thoroughness.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: can you give me a quick rundown?</p>
<p>X29V5n: Most basic tier, you throw a few hundred our way, depending on who is involved, who we put forward and who you expect is going to need to hear it, words. We talk, we let them know we’re serious about wanting X, Y &amp; Z. No hassle. We throw our weight around a bit. Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: yeah</p>
<p>X29V5n: Maybe you want to ensure that plate ends up in the most ideal condition. A thousand or a few thousand covers a bit of roughing up. Scratch on the face, scuffing, the sort of thing that can be fixed up.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: can we maybe not talk about commemorative plates? maybe action figures? plates make me think of my abuela</p>
<p>X29V5n: If you want more coverage for your action figures, depending if we’re talking b-lister or a-lister or something bigger, we might be talking upwards of five, ten thou for more severe damage. Ruined leg, arm, the sort of damage to the face that would take an expert to restore.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: getting pretty steep</p>
<p>X29V5n: We’re talking cape shit. It’s in high demand, limited supply. Prices climb.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: just observing. is there a higher tier? what’s the highest tier?</p>
<p>X29V5n: Highest tier covers complete and total destruction. Pulling out all the stops. Starts at twenty thou, but I gotta warn you, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: that sounds good</p>
<p>X29V5n: Good.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: would you be willing to let me pay half upfront? we’d keep you guys in reserve? particulars get complicated</p>
<p>X29V5n: We work with complicated. Yes. That could be workable.<br>
X29V5n: We will need to negotiate pricing. Did they tell you how to send the image of the product?</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: u5zxN8wEXAKpbBeqzvzy.i</p>
<p>X29V5n: Perfect.<br>
X29V5n: No wait.<br>
X29V5n: You got the instructions very wrong, kid.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: it’s fine</p>
<p>X29V5n: You’re sure? There’s something deeply wrong with this.</p>
<p><strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: why don’t we meet for the rest? I’ll send you the first half now<br>
<strong>3A::u@T_Enki</strong>: there</p>
<p>X29V5n: Alright. Let’s talk meeting places.</p>

<p><strong>♦ Topic: Amnesty &amp; The Devil We Know<br>
In: Boards ► News ► Events ► Gimel.US<br>
</strong><strong>E.S.Reaver</strong><br>
Posted on August 19th, Y1:</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few articles and wanted to compile them. There’s a narrative here, if you don’t grasp it then bear with me an I’ll sum up my thoughts at the end.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article: Strange Reversals: Villain to Hero</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forum Thread<br>
</span></strong>The number of heroes is rising. Multiple known villains have shucked off the black capes for white ones. Which is a good thing, right?</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Article: No Witnesses Remain</span></strong> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forum Thread</strong></span><br>
The article identifies three villains who we know about in heroic groups &mdash; two with the Wardens and one with Shelter. They committed crimes, we have some limited information or scraps of wiki articles, but the witnesses of those past crimes are either dead or yet to establish themselves. We established standards for amnesty, but sometimes those standards can’t be met. The ex-villains find places on the team with nobody to naysay.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Article: Two Black Raincoats</strong></span> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forum Thread</strong></span><br>
Let’s get to the examples. Four youths tried to get superpowers by working off of the ‘trigger’ theory of power gain, and became a newsworthy case in 2004. The event got out of hand, one boy and one girl took charge and preyed on the two younger members of the group, torturing them over the course of a weekend. Nobody gained powers, the search for the missing children led to the two older children being identified as they went into town on the Monday to get food and buy power tools, including a circular saw. They revealed the location of their victims; one of whom apparently lost fingers as the wire that was used to attach them to the toilet tank was too tight. Unnamed Boy was sent to juvie. Unnamed Girl was sent to psychiatric care. Both gained powers while in care, both were released in or around 2009. Reuniting, now with powers, they killed three people, wearing black raincoats to keep the blood off, and were not caught. They have been spotted in several locations at the Rochester span, wearing the black raincoats.</p>
<p>“For the time being, the amnesty applies,” Chief Armstrong stated to the media. “We know where they are and we’re keeping tabs.”</p>
<p>Good enough?</p>
<p><strong>Article: “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rended”, “Torn Up”, “Dismembered”</span></strong> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forum Thread</strong></span><br>
Written after Miss Militia and Vista, heroines under the Wardens, were seen on several occasions in the company of Hellhound, also known as Bitch or Rachel Lindt. Raises questions about the moral compromise the amnesty has wrought and the longstanding allegations that the Protectorate team in Brockton Bay was cooperating with the local villains. Once the relationship is established and we’re reminded of the past examples, the article devotes the latter half to reminding us of some of Rachel Lindt’s deeds when she was working with a group of warlords to seize Brockton Bay.</p>
<p>“Every day, I wake up and I try to move my leg. The wind gets knocked out of me when it doesn’t move like it should. If I’m active at all during the day, then the pain hits me in the evening.”</p>
<p><strong>Article: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fallen: What You Need To Know</span></strong> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forum Thread</strong></span><br>
The Fallen operate as a cult and they’re one of the largest cape groups around. The article doesn’t talk about it directly, but the forum thread has some great posts on the subject (see page <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3</strong></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>12</strong></span>). Their recruitment numbers are swelling and I (and others!) think it’s the amnesty that’s letting them get away with it. There’s a lot of talk of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lachlan Hund [article linked]</strong></span> elsewhere and there might be a court case revolving around what others are saying was a powers-assisted abduction. Totally Fallen M.O. for years prior, family says Lachlan never showed any pro-Fallen sentiment before this.</p>
<p><strong>Article: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> No Cost</span></strong> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Forum Thread</strong></span><br>
Same article author as ‘No Witnesses Remain’. Following up on several villains who didn’t turn hero, the author finds two villains, both anonymous, who claim they received accommodations, at a time when many were still living in the tent cities. They got ahead of the ‘line’, they got basic apartments and utilities paid for, and they contribute nothing except the fact that they aren’t (as far as we know) committing crimes these days. It’s like we’ve caved to extortion.</p>
<hr>
<p>We need to have a dead serious conversation about the amnesty. Justice shouldn’t fall by the wayside. Absolutely horrific individuals get their second chances but they get them at the expense of the safety and peace of mind of others. They get things easier.</p>
<p>We heard the arguments why at the start. We had other things to think about and deal with. Heroes had other things. We thought. We dealt. The heroes handled the biggest needs. That was then.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m not buying into the anti-cape sentiment you see here and there.</p>
<p>But I’m anti&mdash;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">these</span>-capes. I’m anti&mdash;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">this.</span></p>

What’s wrong with extortion? What’s wrong with taking measures?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you stand at the bottom of a hill and a car starts rolling down it with nobody in the drivers seat what do you do?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The way some of you imbeciles are talking about this I can’t help but think you would stand there bitching about the situation until the car hits you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Get out of their way first and then make sure it wasn’t one part of bigger problem or disaster.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then and only then do you address the problem with your indignation and sense of injustice cold, clear, and gripped in steady hands. Find some weapon or power and take action.</p>

@ Mangled_Wings<br>
1) villains aren’t cars. villains are humans. they’re accountable for their actions.<br>
2) we have more choices than ‘get out of their way’. We’re part of a greater society. We have the choice of catering to them or treating them like the scumbags they are. we’re accountable for how we respond to them. our government is accountable for how they respond to them.<br>
3) ‘imbeciles’ isn’t helping foster good discussion<br>
4) can someone please ban mlekk? They’re in every other thread. Admin said they would deal with low-investment content<br>
5) why the fuck is mlekk one of the only people with working badges?</p>

There are three kinds of villain. There are villains at rest that don’t do anything unless bothered and they may be easy to bother. Don’t bother them unless you’re sure you’re stronger than them. If you don’t have powers you aren’t stronger than them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are villains in motion. They want something or they’re going somewhere. Don’t get in their way unless you’re a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lot</span> stronger than them. Catch them from the flanks or from behind if you’re strong and clever enough.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These two kinds of villain don’t budge. I’ve known a lot of them. I know how they operate. It takes a lot to move the ones at rest and it takes a lot to change the course of the ones in motion. You can’t do either. Don’t try.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The third kind is the kind worth paying attention to and they’re the ones that are changing or that can change. Objects in motion stay in motion and objects at rest stay at rest and the times and situations to watch out for are when they change states.</p>

You act like you’re the only one who understands the situation<br>
What guarantee is there that they’re ever going to handle things?<br>

Like me, New_Ohmstar. I have worked with more than twenty villains. I am a villain. When I give you recommendations about leaving sleeping dogs alone I am referring to myself. When I tell you that you want to get out of the way if I have something I want? Referring to myself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am not one of the leeches. I pay for my own apartment. I make no trouble. Yet. Yes I am talking to the heroes. They keep their eye on me and I keep my eye on them. There are other factors. This makes degrees of sense you are not equipped to comprehend. For now it is fine and you should take my word for it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’m aiming to get stronger. I’m aiming to get smarter. I am not the only one doing this. If you spend your time bitching on the internet instead of doing the same then you’re one of the imbeciles because things are changing and you will fall behind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I can verify any of this if I must but I don’t know how as I am new to this site.</p>

<p>♦ <strong>Private Conversation with Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> You said you’d help.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Hello to you too.<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Click on your username while reading any thread you’ve posted in. Go to the Help panel. There will be a list of options. Third box, second option, badge verification You might want to open a new window so you can go back from this convo to that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> It says import image.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Take a picture of yourself in costume and a piece of paper with your username on it. Connect phone or camera to computer. Find the image and select it, hit the ‘select’ button on the bottom corner of the window.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> I don’t have a phone or camera.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Does your computer have a camera built into the monitor?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: OS360?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> Yes. I think.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Draw the circle in the center of the desktop to open the radial menu. Hit ‘C’ and camera should be something visible. Open it, wait for your image to appear. You’ll want to be in costume. Hit space.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> It made a shutter sound.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: You were in costume already?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> It’s fine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Sure. You’ll find the picture in the ‘pictures’ bubble</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> Thank you. I found it. I imported it. It wants me to put in a label before I hit select.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky:<strong> ‘</strong>Villain’, I guess. I don’t know if you really want to do that. You might want to go ‘Cape’ if you want to fly under the radar. People are sore about villains these days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> I don’t fly under the radar. I know what I am and I know what I’ll be, if I don’t die first. Thank you for the help. I respect this more than I respect the more self-pitying of the invertebrates out there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Alright.<br>
<strong> Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I’m unfortunately afflicted with desire to help people.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> A dire inflection, that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: 0:) I don’t know if you’re at rest or moving or if you’re open to change, but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Things will go smoother if you don’t call them invertebrates or imbeciles<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: And maybe stay at rest a little longer, given the chance?<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: I think they really need it<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: We all need it.<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Also. It just occurred to me. If you connect at a library, you’ll want to delete the image before you go. Overwrite it once it is deleted to be sure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> You kill more flies with vinegar in reality.<br>
<strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> A person can rest only so long. I’m restless.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: What a pity.<br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky: Spend more time online. Geek out. Learn! Less time spent being bad!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> I am not averse to learning. We will see if there is any pity to be had.<br>
<strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> I am at a library. I will do that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Point_Me_@_The_Sky: You can draw the circle and hit ‘o’ to find overwrite.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mangled_Wings:</strong> I already found it. Thank you. Goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>♦ Topic: [JRPNA] Use of Cluster Powers, Serial Powers, Matched Powers, and Nth-generation Powers to identify ‘Hinge Points’ in Power Expression &mdash; 1998<br>
In: Boards ► Parahuman Science<br>
Azavael</strong> (PRT Science)<br>
Posted on : June 4th, 2002</p>
<p><strong>[Article]</strong> Studies into Parahuman abilities presently catalogue studied powers into three major databases: the PRT database in the US, the Cambridge Parahuman Studies facility, and the EUJP International Listing. The lists are formed by way of interview and laboratory studies with each institution using universally standardized forms in addition to supplementary material. Each of these three institutions have stated an express or strongly-implied desire to understand and predict expressions of power and tie these expressions to the inciting incidents. However, a longstanding problem in this process is that powers expressed, inciting incidents, and contextual factors can be dramatically different across individual cases. While some common themes can be drawn out, derived results are traditionally very big-picture. It is only recently that databases have begun to include sufficient numbers of special-case triggers that allow more focused study of how powers are expressed. We identified cluster powers, serial powers, matched powers, and Nth-generation powers as the special cases to focus on in more focused examination of how power instances can be mapped and we posit a ‘Hinge Point’ illustration of power expression and theory.</p>
<p><strong>[Definitions]</strong> • Cluster powers are defined as powers wherein multiple inciting incidents occur either simultaneously or within a minute of one another. Such parahumans will have a collection of smaller powers related to the others. • Serial powers are defined as cases where an individual or multiple individuals in longstanding proximity to a parahuman will develop powers…</p>

<p><strong>♦ Topic: Multi-Trigger Case Studies &mdash; Parahumans 303 Class Notes (Spinky) &mdash; September 15th 2009<br>
In: Boards ► Parahuman Science ►Non-Articles<br>
Rightsector</strong><br>
Posted on : September 17th, 2009</p>
<p>From Wednesdays with Prof Spinky. Posted with permission. Cleaned up where I could</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: What are clusters?<br>
Other names are mosaic p. expression, grabbag, multi<br>
Effect on resulting power<br>
Why important &amp; Importance to study.<br>
Case studies<br>
Greater effects, things to keep in mind</p>
<p><strong>Pt. 1</strong>: What are clusters?<br>
2-6 people trigger at same time or very close together. Each gets a suite of powers. Person A gets Person A primary power and fragment of B, C, D, E, F.<br>
Person B gets Person B primary power and fragment A, C, D, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Pt 2</strong>: Effect on resulting power<br>
Term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">secondary expressions</span>. Weaker or subtle power. Can be conditional.<br>
Primary powers may be weaker than if they had triggered alone?<br>
Powers inspired by others but not identical. Relation may be tertiary.<br>
Example given firebreath &mdash;&gt; fire <span style="text-decoration: underline;">something</span> or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">something</span> breath<br>
Prof stresses this is very basic example<br>
Term for staying element is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hinge</span> (old) or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dominant</span> (current). Relates to 1998 article.</p>
<p><strong>Pt 3</strong>: Why important &amp; importance to study<br>
Suggests powers aren’t 100% predetermined. Certain elements are highlighted or made dominant.<br>
We can extrapolate from studies like this &amp; serial triggers to work out key elements of existing triggers. What changes &amp; why = what factors are important in standalone non-special trigger?</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies:</strong> two cases &amp; how we look at them<br>
Two case studies. Interview, self-reporting, examination</p>
<p><strong>Case Study #1</strong>: Sunder Bros<br>
Take note for future week: matched powers. We come back to this.<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brother #1</span> &mdash; Destruction caused to objects ripples out indefinitely, stopping at clear demarcations (images included in lecture notes). Weapon extension without limit (except convenience)<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brother #2</span> &mdash; Weapon sweep extension &mdash; some range extension &mdash; wider arcs, shockwaves left/right of swing. Stomp to destroy ground in immediate area.</p>
<p>Class pauses, prof asks &amp; responds to input re: dominant factors in each power.</p>
<p>Cute girl in red top finally comes up with answer that satisfies Spinky. Destruction &amp; weapon attack augmentation dominant/staying/hinge factors. Question of range vs. breadth between brothers. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not</span> very lopsided in power difference b/w primary &amp; secondary power. Spinky’s stress on not.</p>
<p>We get some slides of brother’s recreation of trigger circumstance. Distance from threat. Prof Spinky highlights personality traits brothers used on forms they filled out. All as reasoning for different power expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Case Study #2</strong>: Fowl &amp; Fair (foreign capes, names that follow are badly translated)<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oxfair</span> &mdash; Physical augmentation; size, strength, speed, agility (&lt;&mdash; primary), deafening roar, transfer harm from falls/some impacts to nearby others, pain resistance/faster healing<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ramfair</span> &mdash; Emotion affecting chant, size increase, some ability to heal very recent damage of others listening to chant/that touching, gather strength/concentrate &mdash;&gt; giant leaps<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foulcock</span> (yes, the class laughed) &mdash; Flight with build-up of speed over time, speed is transferred to touched others, interrupting flight to deliver high-impact blows. Increased agility, deafening shriek, fast recovery of smaller wounds (scratches yes, no recovery of larger wounds).<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foulpig</span> &mdash; Personal biokinesis, swell into flesh bubble with fast recovery/personal mutations if not ‘popped’ in time. Some strength &amp; size increase, but slower while grown. Ability to ‘roll’ with incoming impacts (mover expression? Turns into boulder). Guttural noise (flatulence? Burps?) to interrupt thought processes &mdash; turn off others’ brains momentarily.</p>
<p>Discussion of dynamic. Fair &amp; foul on opposite sides post-trigger. Only fair provided answers &amp; allowed power testing, rest has to be inferred. Handouts.</p>
<p>Some discussion of trigger event (see <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>slides</strong></span> for images), some discussion of resulting ‘package’. Powers for each individual distinct but play off each other in semi-complementary way. Reflective of personality? Or ‘guiding hand’ principle?</p>
<p><strong>Pt. 4</strong>: Greater effects &amp; things to keep in mind &mdash; things touched on in homework reading:<br>
Kill / Kiss &mdash; more on this in parahuman psychology class in a few weeks<br>
Personality Bleed &mdash; personality traits bleed over from 1 individual to other? Messy<br>
Higher incidences of paranoia, confrontation, aggression, PTSD. Less bounce back?<br>
Higher rate of death post-trigger. Kill / kiss again. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Graph</span></strong><br>
Prof Spinky stresses emotional states may play into the above. Triggers that are sufficient to draw in multiple individuals are worse than average. Can’t jump 2 conclusions. Correlation =/= causation.</p>

<p><strong>♦ Topic: [EUJPR] Relationship Entanglement in Cluster-Triggers &mdash; 2005<br>
In: Boards ► Parahuman Science<br>
Jr_Max</strong><br>
Posted on : February 18th, 2005</p>
<p><strong>[Translation]</strong> Colloquially known as the kill/kiss dynamic, in cluster-triggers, there is a very high tendency toward passionate relationships, either hostility or partnership. Clusters have a 40% chance of one member murdering another, rising to a 50% chance when including attempted murder, 25% chance of a partnership forming, and a 10% incidence of partnership and murder coinciding. The term partnership is used for romantic pairings in instances where sexuality and gender allow, and close friendship or formed teams with members in other cases. In some (10% of) cases of close partnerships forming, the romantic pairing occurred despite one’s typical sexuality. The relationship entanglement study looks at existing cases and clusters to investigate why.</p>
<p>The most dramatic case in recent memory is the S<span lang="cs">táj, also known as the Stable, or the Foul and the Fair. The Good Ox was turned into a grisly display […]<br>

<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: If you were one of mine.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> I’m going to do what my friends said and block you if you don’t explain.</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You’re clearly looking for info on multis.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> Yes<br>
<strong>of5:</strong> I am.</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I can provide.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: We can collaborate.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Is important to have others to watch your back</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> I’ve found some people.</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Unless you are a member of a very new cluster, limited # of people you can be.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I found most of the group at I-275. Rest of them wouldn’t be searching online like you are.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I found two members of the shipwreck group. They might be doing what you’re doing with the searching but they know the code. They’re friends of mine. Third member of that group is dead.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The lecture hall: if you were one of them, you wouldn’t be so naive.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: That leaves three options. The Kansas Cornfield massacre: 3 dead, 1 alive with no reason to care about multis. He ate the rest of his cluster.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> Ate?</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The book fair. Only ones still alive there are within spitting distance of me.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Ate. I know why, too. I can share, but not for free.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Leaves two good options. I can skip one because it’s mine.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You’re part of the new cluster from the mall.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> No comment.</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I found one of you already. I reached out to him first. He said no. Bad for him. Lucky for you.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> Lucky?</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The one I talked to said there’s a woman, two boys, and him. I’m going to assume you’re the one I’ve termed the runt. The smallest, easiest target.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: The woman is gathering funds to hire mercenaries and come after you. The one I talked to hired an information broker to find you. Her name is Tattletale. She’s good. She has resources. including the mercenaries I just mentioned. She’s also preoccupied for now.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: A favor from me to you.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: That leaves you &amp; the last one. It sounds like all 3 are coordinating vs. you.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: I can just about guarantee the people they’re gathering together are better than the ones you got.<br>
17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You need help. You’ve got a case of Kiss/Kill like I never saw and I don’t think they’re reaching for the chapstick.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> You’re wrong</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: About the need for help?</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> It isn’t Kiss/Kill.<br>
<strong>of5:</strong> I’ll take any help I can get.<br>
<strong>of5:</strong> Provided I can get some clue you’re legit.</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: Glad to hear.</p>
<p><strong>of5:</strong> and some idea of what you’re really after</p>
<p>17593Q183H17953R9713E714693: You. And a chance to deal with some mutual enemies.<br>

<p><span lang="cs">[<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>…</strong></span>] We were ultimately unable to stop them, as they had two capes we had no information or records on. The first of the capes may have been a thinker, likely the same that shot down our flier. We were unable to glean much more from them, other than the fact they wore fur in the midst of a heatwave.<br>
</span></p>
<p>The second individual seems to be a grab-bag cape. She was a woman with a fanged mask covering her lower face, and a form-fitting dress with a slit up the side of one leg. She displayed a <strong>mover power</strong> [fourth term] with the ability to run on walls. She produced an <strong>emotion-affecting</strong> [third term] roar, which broke the ranks of one of the cooperating teams, and had metal <strong>claws</strong> [second term] which looked to be of tinker make. These claws may have been what enabled her to <strong>tear</strong> [First term not met, but within allowance] down doors and other barricades with the ease she did. We have the beginnings of a work-up going online shortly.</p>
<p>The attack on the store opening was a failure on our side. We were late to the scene due to geography and we lacked full knowledge of our adversaries. It is our belief that with PHO in working order and more collaborative tools and measure being put in place every day, that we will succeed next time where we failed this once. We are working with authorities to keep an eye out for the stolen merchandise.[…]</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Your Nilles University Application<br>
August 21st, Y1<br>
</strong>Dear Applicant (Point_Me_@_The_Sky@mail)</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that your application for graduate study in our department was turned down. We look at each application and applicant as a whole and decisions are based on a composite of information including your previous academic performance, referrals, relevant professional activities, proposed research statements, and test scores.</p>
<p>Due to a high volume of applicants, this message has been partially automated. Your application was received by paper and email and discussed by me and one other faculty member. We responded by email as per your preference. We would like to stress, for your particular application:<br>
• That we would very much like you to apply again in future years.<br>
• That we would encourage you to use the same email address, as we can easily tie it back to this application.<br>
• We felt your academics were very strong.<br>
• We felt your extracurriculars were exceptional.<br>
• We felt your references were exceptional.<br>
• In a time when records are often lacking and references may be hard to identify or contact, your application stood above and beyond in how complete and thorough it was.</p>
<p>Nilles is one of three Universities serving an estimated population of fifty million on Earth Gimel and its associated territories, and it is the sole post-secondary institution offering graduate studies. Over one and a half million bright and eager minds have applied to Nilles in avid hope of starting or resuming their educations, and regretfully, with our current facilities, we cannot accept more than twenty thousand.</p>
<p>Although these circumstances mean we must regretfully send you an unfavorable response, we appreciate your application. We wish you the best in your future endeavors and look forward to hearing from you next year.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br>
Dr. Marilyn Ginbar<br>
Graduate Advisor</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I’ve been thinking about it all day. Made a list. Lots of unreasonable answers that are semi-possible. sentiment / reference backstabs me / people with ties to uni staff get in first / uni tied to gov + gov wants specific focus for research<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I could go on. I know some of those sound crazy<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> + all of that? If true then no reason to think next year will be different. Last year was a third the number applicants, they accepted 2.5%. This year, what? 1.4%?</p>

<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Today I have stuff to do. I work and think.<br>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> hello?</p>
<p>A_real: Hello. Thank you for the prompt response. I’m Sydney</p>
<p>Curious_Cephalopod: I can guess what this is about</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: According to our systems you have 32 individual accounts that you’re rotating through.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> this is true</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Is it really needed to have one individual account for each day of the month and one for what I assume are holidays?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> not what I was doing…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …but would be amusing with some reshuffling…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …assuming it was allowed…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …I’m guessing you will say it isn’t</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Duplicate accounts are of concern when it comes to tracking action across accounts</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I see</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Isn’t that a hassle to manage 32 separate accounts?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I use a program to copy over settings</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I see.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I checked ToS. I don’t think any of this is against the rules</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: But why do it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> security. I’m being surveilled…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …doing this lets me find out things</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Surveilled?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> yes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: On PHO?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> if they were stalking me elsewere and not here where it’s stalker central then they would be bad at what they do…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> *elsewhere…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong>  …and they aren’t</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: If you’re trying to obfuscate, I have to question why you use a chain of names that connect to one another.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong>  I’m not trying to hide. I’m trying to find out things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Do I need to notify authorities? If you’re joking, you need to tell me now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> that would cause more problems than it fixes…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …can we just say I’m joking and you agree and you can tell me what my punishment is…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …or what I need to do to fix this issue?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I remain concerned.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> how about this?…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …one second…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …there. It should be in my user images.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Verification_For_Sydney.i<br>
A_real: I see it. I see. I’m assuming that in a matter of days, if you’re an avian of some sort…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> Insect. Yes, I could supply a different verification image…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …so can we chalk this up to a peculiarity of mine? Powers weirdness?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I’ll have to discuss with others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> alright</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I’m not wholly satisfied with this resolution. Either you were joking about something serious<br>
A_real: Or you’re being cavalier about something serious</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> Or I’m being watched and I’ve been under various kinds of observation for some time…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …and this isn’t that serious. Consider me a curious sort of multi-limbed invertebrate who would be happy to be left alone…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …except there’s always someone on the other side of the glass, tapping or taking notes. Ears pressed up against the walls. constant whispers…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …things moved in my habitat when I’m not looking…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I think I have a sense of what you’re getting at.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …anohd thgis poartiocular obdserver is benign</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: ?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I see.<br>
A_real: I’m putting you down as a verified cape, with some notes. I’m not going to make this available to anyone looking at your profile unless you want it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I don’t</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I would like to link all of your 32 accounts together. This might take a few hours of fiddling on my end. It would only be info available to us and to you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> and to any outside parties with access to my computer?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: I would avoid letting anyone have that access, if possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> that will be fine. I will try and I’m fine with being linked up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A_real: Thank you for cooperating. Have a good day.</p>

<p><strong>♦ Topic: Multiversal Travel Warnings<br>
In: Boards ► Gimel.US<br>
Khain</strong> (Guild Staff)<br>
Posted on August 22nd, Y1:</p>
<p>The Guild is presently established in three facilities outside of the city in Gimel.US, supporting authorities and serving as bodyguards and representatives for the onetime denizens of Earth Bet, as new areas are surveyed and contact with new cultures is made.</p>
<p>The process is exciting and interesting, and we report back as much as we are able, but it does have its hazards. After two recent incidents, we have decided to reach out to those we are familiar with, who are familiar with us. This forum is one of many places we’ll be striving to communicate needs and necessities.</p>
<p>Humans are explorers by nature. Our best count right now, excepting areas we cannot fully access, is that portals, devices, and tears between realities are currently allowing access to forty-seven Earths. Six of those Earths have been blocked off due to implicit threats or are fundamentally inaccessible. Two more have been closed off at the request of their denizens. Earth Aleph, which most Earth Bet residents are or were familiar with, has been blocked off as well.</p>
<p>Speak with authorities before making any trips to territories unknown. We don’t and can’t mount effective rescue operations if someone leaves and fails to return, but we have some ability to do so if and when authorities know where you’ve gone and you’ve stuck to the established route. People got lost or stranded in the wilderness on Earth in 2012, with all that world’s satellites. It can and will happen in new universes.</p>
<p>Do not travel to inhabited worlds. Absolutely do not make first contact. The first of the two incidents noted above was one where a family traveled across Earth Chamesh and happened across a settlement we were currently talking to. Much confusion and concern was had and we are still recovering.</p>
<p>The second is to please stick to charted territories. Exploring the uncharted is exciting, but if you aren’t equipped, you can come to harm, even if the world is uninhabited. One ex-Bet government (which shall remain unnamed) sent one expedition to Earth Achat. The Europe of that world was home to an invasive species, which grew as a tubular mold in dark, shadowed spaces, particularly in forest. Eating food exposed to the spores these molds created causes stomach cramps that progress to reflexive vomiting over the course of two to five days. The vomiting then lasts another two to five days, causing death by dehydration for any who don’t receive care.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware:</strong><br>
• <strong>Earth Gimel</strong> has been partially explored and checked by thinkers. There are no guarantees. Except for some rare indigenous colonies, it is unsettled. Gimel has five major points of settlement, with civilization finding its foothold around these points. The City, as of yet unnamed, is the primary US point of settlement and one of the primary waypoints. The City is a <b>megalopolis</b> with a commonly cited population of fifty million. A rough map (one month out of date) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>here.</strong></span><br>
• <strong>Earth Mem</strong> has been partially settled by others from Bet. We are currently trying to establish some kind of communication and link.<br>
For novice explorers and those looking to settle new territories, we would encourage Gimel and Mem as largely safe options.</p>
<p>• <strong>Earth Bet</strong> has been deemed uninhabitable. Contrary to popular belief, radiation is not a major concern. However, many industrial sites were either destroyed or have weathered the last two years of neglect poorly, with chemicals leeching into groundwater and settling in valleys. Terrible numbers of deceased humans and other living species have led to other health concerns, particularly in previously heavily settled areas that received heavy damage. There will always be those who attempt to hold onto what we have lost, and many persist in trying to maintain some existence on Bet. However, new incidents arise on what seems to be a weekly or twice-weekly basis, with one in three having to do with powers, the powered, untended tinker technology, masters, and lingering threats. We may one day return to Bet, as some groups have fervently expressed a desire to do, but we have a great deal of work to do before this is possible. It may not happen in our generation or our children’s generation. Be aware that if you choose to return to Bet (and most authorities agree you have the fundamental right to do so) you may have to re-apply for entry and you will very likely be putting your well being in peril.</p>
<p>Speak with authorities before traveling to any other worlds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>More information on multiversal threats.</strong></span></p>
<p>More information to be disclosed about outside threats and cultures as we have it.</p>

It’s about concentration. The fight happened near here. Scion attacked. We don’t know why but it might have had to do with the Slaughterhouse Nine, going by the news reports and what some have said. It might have had to do with the Simurgh. It could have been something else altogether. But things wrapped up near here. People came through and most of us picked two worlds to settle in, with Gimel as the big one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But a lot of people fought. A lot of capes. Many were foreign. The fight ended… and then? We are doing or did our best to get them home, but not all want to go home. Or Scion didn’t leave them a home to go back to. A lot of them have gathered into like groups. That’s where we get the weird corner-world settlements.</p>

the corner world places aren’t inherently bad tho, right? we (my family) just got into the city one month ago. right away pressure pressure. we can move into city but standardized rent and we need to earn wage and we may be asked to move. best option is to move to city periphery and farm. they say they will give us tools and resources to get started but good spots are taken or very far away and farming isn’t easy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">corner worlds are closer in a way. go to noon, go to wherever from there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">if we aren’t reconstruction or farming we aren’t wanted. so why become cogs in the city’s machine? we can strike off on our own. minor risk but total freedom</p>

@ Venturain &mdash; that was our mindset. My family tried it.<br>
We had the bad fortune of settling at one corner settlement. Two points removed. We got off to an okay start. Shelter up, food out, basic needs covered. Regular trips to the city to supply up and cover more advanced needs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Winter of Year Zero caught us off guard. We thought we were ahead of what we needed but staying warm gets hard and getting warm means chopping wood, which means physical effort, which means needing more food.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was handling most trips into the city. I was worn out and got real sick. My brother handled one trip, asked for help, came back with capes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">They helped, yeah. Then they took over. It was bad. You can find my photo diary on my user page.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My brother went out and asked for help again. The second time around, the capes were willing to fix the problem and leave. Most of us moved back to the city. Bitter feelings.</p>

@ Venturain &mdash; there’s need for other work. doctors. teachers. there’s a need for people that are good at finding and vetting the skilled labor. finding qualified doctors and getting them to hospitals, finding teachers and helping to establish new schools.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">organization is the hardest part.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">many injured, many with special needs. i’m in robotics and prosthetics and there’s no shortage of need. my friend is a radiologist and he’s in high demand.</p>

Many of those things require education. Letters started arriving yesterday. Rejected, rejected, rejected. No education. My friends are saying government is holding off on setting up schools because there is so much need for physical labor, industry, agriculture.</p>

Right now we don’t seem to have many threats at home. Things are quiet. The monsters are out there if they’re even alive. Sleeper is still in Zayin and seems contained there. The Birdcage was abandoned and we don’t know if the residents were left to starve. Few of the real monsters seem to be here. The dictators don’t have the infrastructure. Our best capes are off doing good work and seeing what’s out there. Our capes at home are calm and quiet. I’m okay with that.</p>

Not all of the dictators. Not every place was ruined. There are monsters out there who I will not name out of fear for my safety. They were kept in check back on Bet and nothing holds them back now that much of the world has evacuated. The weather may be bad there but they may not have had industry or other problems to taint things. Things are looking up here but there I think it may be hellish for the citizens. Who can help them? Is difficult. If calamity comes in plague or bugs or rats then the people suffer, but dictators will not let them escape. I make calls every day.</p>

<p>♦ <strong>Joined Group Conversation: Cap, Heart_Shaped_Pupil,</strong> <strong>of5, Mangled_Wings</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: I don’t know that much</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: You know some. You were a corporate hero.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Share. Don’t be shy. 😉</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: I was a man on the ground in a flashy costume. I was told to do things and I did them. my mental energy went toward figuring out what I would do when I had discretion.<br>
Cap: Some of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: I know what you mean about mental energy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: right? time management is a nightmare even without complications. add family, team drama, having to look good for the cameras and magazines and I wasn’t exactly thinking about upper management. I listened to the boss and I winked at the intern with the cute butt sometimes.<br>
Cap: I didn’t dwell on the ins and outs. so if you want me to supply info on the ins and outs of how the corporate capes work as a business, I can’t. I don’t even want to dwell on it. those were bad times for me. there’s a reason I left it behind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: I hope you can share what you do know at some point.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: Of course.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Spending a lot of mental energy lately, R?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: I might have to go to ground. I may not be able to travel to the next town to use library hookup until our next meeting. I have some indications that some people are after me. More than they were the day before yesterday.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: do you need me to come? My brother and I can visit, hang out, offer you some backup. I might not remember much about the nuances of the corp team, but I have pride in my ability in a scrap</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: I appreciate that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: it could be fun. you’re the closest thing I have to a best friend atm, so we might as well hang at some point.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Oof. Yes. We get along best, out of the group. It would be good in other times, maybe. But I don’t know what vectors they can use to attack or track me. This whole thing is a mess.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with the cluster-trigger clusterfuck</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Amen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: Agreed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Easiest if I just drop off the radar for a bit. We can touch base later. I might check in to see if S showed and we can go from there. Otherwise I see you in a few days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: help is available if you need it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: i was going to say. i’d ♥love♥ to be of help</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: I’m safe where I am for now. in a sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: With family?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Mostly. Obviously not when I’m here. Hard to strike a balance. It’s not good times.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: My sympathies.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: C. good to see you stepping out of the shadows.<br>
Cap: I wondered if you would speak up</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> the shadows are where it’s comfortable and safe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: The shadows are where the real monsters lurk</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> that too, A…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …that too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: why are you curious, out of curiosity?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Doing research?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> curious in the british sense…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …odd, quirky, eccentric…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …I was doing research, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: On?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> figuring out the landscape. looking at maps. where we want to set up.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: and?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> and it feels like the A-listers are busy. everyone else is in the shadows…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …waiting for someone else to break the peace and take the hate when they get blamed…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …the problem is we’re so geographically spread out. even if we discount R.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: I’m aiming to move into the city. There are complications</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: your friend</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: a lot of things.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong>  the megalopolis makes for bad logistics.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: I do hope you’ll step out of those shadows more, c.<br>
Cap: it’s been interesting talking to you online and seeing how talkative you are here.<br>
Cap: I like what you contribute when you speak up</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong>  that’s me being an introvert.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: that’s fixable</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I think you badly underestimate my introversion, T…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Okay, hold on.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: A!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> Ah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Good things good feelings. I’m psyched because this all feels positive.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> maybe</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: On the topic of positivity…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> ? Did you disconnect?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: So I was thinking we should meet in the city. You were talking about logistics and I was thinking about where eveyrone was. you’re closest to me and we’re the same age I think? So I was thinking we could meet and talk strategy over fast food. We could even do something after and build team bonds and things like that. Maybe a movie or arcade. Whatever you want to do.<br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil: No pressure.<br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Sorry. I wrote and rewrote that three times</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> You mean a date?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I didn’t say a date.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> But you mean a date.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Maybe. Sure. Springtime of youth and all that pizazz.<br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Or pre-springtime. Tweentime of spring? The thawing of the slush doesn’t have the same conotations</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> I think there are about a hundred different reasons why I should say no to that. actually…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …make that two hundred. I legitimately think I could name two hundred reasons why that’s a terrible idea.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Really? Two hundred?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> The more I think of it, the more reasons I come up with…<br>
<strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …no, K.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Can I ask why?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> because you’re you and I’m me…<strong><br>
Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> …no and don’t ask again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Ok. 🙂<br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Can I ask another question?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Curious_Cephalopod:</strong> will I regret saying yes?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: When you were talking to Ms. Sydney earlier<br>

Heart_Shaped_Pupil: What was it?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Hi H.T.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Hi Kenzie.<br>
Houndstooth: I’m in the middle of a conversation with Ave. She said you reached out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’m keeping an eye out for my old teammates.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’m glad you’re alive, houndstooth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I’m glad you’re alive too, Kenzie.<br>
Houndstooth: What are you up to these days?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’m looking at joining a team. Kind of. We’re still figuring a lot out. It’s exciting. they’re neat.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: That’s really good to hear<br>
Houndstooth: I’ve talked to some of the others offline. We made out better than most. The only question mark is 10-59, but I’m suspicious they’re okay.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I already found them. they’re alive and well.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Did you? ok. good. great. Then we only lost Pigeonhole, but you knew about them. We made out better than most.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> it’s great. I’m so relieved.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I really liked the team. Everyone was so cool.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> It was an important time for me. Coming back to Baltimore to join the team was the first time I got to stop and settle down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Yeah</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> It was home<strong><br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> so it means alot to me to hear you say **we** when talking about us making it out mostly okay.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: You know that was then, don’t you?<br>
Houndstooth: Back in the past. Things have changed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> uh huh</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: You got a bad deal, Kenzie. Not the worst I’ve seen but I’ve seen a lot of people get better hands than what you got. You tried as hard as anyone and you did really good work.<br>
Houndstooth: You were a better hero when you were four and a half feet tall than some adult capes I know today</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’ve heard this speech before H.T.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> variants of it<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> you gave me a version of it once<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> you don’t have to let me down easy. I’m tough. 🙂<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> just cut to the chase. 😉</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I think you shouldn’t contact the others.<br>
Houndstooth: They have their own things to work through. They’re rebuilding. Everyone’s looking forward.<br>
Houndstooth: You have a new team. That’s great.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> huh. was i really that bad?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: You weren’t bad okay?<strong><br>
</strong>Houndstooth: You weren’t bad.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> but?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: But…<br>

<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> iv’e grown up some<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> i was there for the end of the world<strong><br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> i did stuff. i actually really helped</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Absolutely<br>
Houndstooth: I keep typing responses and deleting them<br>
Houndstooth: People are gunshy</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> gunshy?<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> of me?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Shit. Now I feel bad.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Don’t<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> i’m disappointed is all</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I can’t stress enough that I have a lot of respect for you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> thank you 🙂<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> can you give me one shot then?<strong><br>
Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> not even as friends. it can be business. I’m useful. you’ve been prasing my work ethic. I’m smart. I have a kind of team. If you do me the favor of giving me a shot I can do you one favor for free.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I don’t know</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> you’re a smart guy and you were a good leader. you know how these things work. you know my power has its uses. others would kidnap me for it. I am offering myself to you and you would be stupid to turn me down. use me. please.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> if you respect me so much then let me prove myself</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Okay.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Yes?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: Sure. Absolutely.<br>
Houndstooth: I can contact you here?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> ok</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I will also talk to the others. I will leave your contact info with them. If they are comfortable with it they can reach out to you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> got it<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’ll cross my fingers. <strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Houndstooth: I have to run.</p>

<p>♦ <strong>Private Conversation with</strong> <strong>Shower</strong> (Admin)<strong>:</strong><br>
<em>Please note that conversations with site administrators may be recorded and reviewed.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: I’d like a moment if you can spare it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: Thank you for the prompt response. I’m Graham. I’m with the PHO IT team. You can call me by my name or just ‘shower’.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: Hi Shower. What can I do for you?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: We had some unusual search activity that seemed to be causing congestion. Would you happen to know anything about this?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: I might. It would have been during off-peak hours though.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: We update infrastructure during off-peak hours. it slowed us down. It stalled us for three hours last night.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: oh that’s not good.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: You’re piggybacking off of our servers?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: I was trying to help. We’ve been updating the wikis as much as we can and three-fifths of the work is gathering data that’s helpful to others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: We?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: It was a stupid hobby project. I was thinking of what everyone wanted the most and information seemed most critical. I had some guys I knew from way before and I thought I’d get everyone up to date and on the same page.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: We often encourage hobby projects on PHO, though we cannot when resources are as tight as they are, and it would depend on scale and the amount of mess created. How easy is this to dismantle, and do I need to talk to anyone else?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: Nobody else. It was me alone. I can fix it right now.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: How bad of a problem is this? Is there any leeway?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: It’s interfering with others’ ability to access things. It might not seem like a problem here, because you’re close to the home node, but there are people on the periphery or far-flung regions and they’re going from satellite to ground to satellite to here, across several Earths.<br>
Shower: I think it’s best if you clean up as much of it as you can.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: I think that since you’re a chat member in good standing, we’d be willing to let this slide with a warning if it can be promptly dealt with without any mess.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil</strong>: I’ll have to reboot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shower: I’ll talk to you shortly.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: they mock me?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I’m sorry.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> You’ve gone quiet. You shouldn’t reply to them, you know.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> You’re still quiet. I don’t think the internet suits you, A.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I think you are beautiful and stunning and terrifying in person. In a good way, I think. Because you and I are on the same side.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Your voice doesn’t translate well.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I think you’re intimidating and you want to be intimidating on the internet and that doesn’t work at all. C is the intimidating one here. Somehow. He has that knack. That atmosphere. The skill.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: C is?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Funny, isn’t it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: I think I hate the internet to the very center of my being.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> If you think about it, with powers and all, the center of your being could include the vast monster in another dimension that’s all hooked up into you. Passenger stuff. The center of mass could be in the middle of an alien god monster the size of a mountain or moon. I imagine it has the energy of a small star stored in it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: This serves to illustrate the depth and energy of my hate for a setting where C might be more intimidating than I am.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> I think I might agree with you on the hate thing. I want to meet face to face and hang out with S and you and maybe C and definitely Cap and R. I want that to work out.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> If that fails, I dunno.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: I am always serious.<br>
Mangled_Wings: We’ll handle this project. I aim to learn all I can. When or if it falls through, I will be an independent villain again. I aim to be a successful one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> Hm.<strong><br>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: What?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> people run scared from me. it seems even non-people run from me, if I pay attention to what happened in the last hour.<br>
<strong>Heart_Shaped_Pupil:</strong> you aren’t running</p>

</strong>Thank you so much! I am having another problem. I’ve been getting caught up on my PMs/DMs/Emails and there is a lot of abusive content. All of the recent messages are very hostile or vulgar. It seems to have started before I even signed back on. I don’t know why. I’m so sorry to raise problems when I’m probationary.</p>

</strong>Graham here. I looked at the incident log and found one major incident that another site admin handled. An article came out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>here</strong></span>. Two groups online identified the people in that article and shared out their screen names and other information. We took action when people used PHO resources (direct messages, email) to harass one of the individuals in the article. We took action and removed them, but they may be returning with the use of new accounts and expanding the number of people targeted.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you could report any or all of those involved, it would help us a great deal. For solutions, I can think of three options: you can continue to report so we can continue to take action (as these are not the people we want on PHO) and we can hope this quiets down, you can move to a new account and start fresh, or you can agree to give PHO staff access to your private messages so we can take action. This would involve us reading anything private in the conversations, and it would mean anyone messaging you was notified that PHO staff can read your things. We would limit this to only recent and new senders, so your friends and pre-existnig conversation partners would stay private. As a bonus the notification could help stem the influx.<br>

<p>♦ <strong>Topic: [Article] Weld to Warden<br>
In: Boards ►</strong> <strong>News ► Events ►Gimel.US<br>
Ball-Chan</strong><br>
Posted on August 23rd Y1:</p>
<p>[Article Text, Editorial]His list of credentials starts off good. A two year tenure as a member of the Boston Wards with no offenses or misconduct reported to the media. He was the third monstrous cape to feature as an actor on a television show, the first to make a second appearance on TV, and the first monstrous cape with an onscreen kiss. He was the subject of a viral online image, released with various humorous captions, and it was a combination of this and arguably his small-network television appearances that gave him his popularity. He rode this success to a position as the first monstrous cape to be the team leader of the Wards. Ambitious fellow, isn’t he?</p>
<p>Weld’s popularity and time in the spotlight made him a figure of interest when, following undisclosed events in Brockton Bay, he turned from the established heroes and brought the vast majority of the monstrous capes in the Protectorate and Wards with him. Speculation flew as to why, and Weld was cagey when asked. No comment, the teenager said.</p>
<p>Weld’s team was dubbed ‘The Irregulars’ in a play on the term for unconventional military squadrons and on the team being wholly made up of monstrous capes. At this stage, it was still possible to praise Weld for his efforts. He reached out to monstrous parahumans both American and international, and he kept his team together while carrying out deeds for the camera. Maintaining a group of such size isn’t an easy task when its numbers are swelling like his group’s did. He wasn’t too open about his methods or his team’s motivations.</p>
<p>Things take an ugly turn from here. When Chevalier announced that the PRT was mending its ways and that the person at the heart of the organization’s corruption had been defeated, Weld’s irregular team of monstrous capes kept away and kept silent. Heroes called for unity, the Suits answered that call, sending many members to America to serve, following a schism of their own.</p>
<p>Even the defeat of Behemoth or the appearance of the new Endbringers didn’t serve to bring Weld back into the fold. If anything, Weld seemed to note that his team’s numbers were dropping. He and the monstrous capes serving under him stopped making as many public appearances. We don’t know what he started doing at this time, but his team was still recruiting. No comment, Weld said.</p>
<p>It’s telling, too, that Weld’s appearance changed. He decorated himself with horns and scales. To those with an eye for the symbolic, Weld was a monstrous cape who was embracing the monster and turning his back on the cape side of things.</p>
<p>More time passed, and more silence followed. No comment, he said, on the rare occasions when he appeared in front of the cameras. No comment.</p>
<p>On that Thursday, June 20th, 2013, Scion took our world from us. He took almost everything from us. Based on our limited accounts of what happened, Weld was there for the initial foray, an organized series of attacks mounted from an oil rig. He was not there after, leading a substantial portion of his team to other venues. There’s no indication of what he was doing, but we do know he wasn’t there for the skirmishes on other worlds, against other major organized groups of parahumans. We do know he wasn’t there for the follow-up confrontation on the beachhead.</p>
<p>Many will argue it was a chaotic time. No reports are wholly accurate, the world was ending, and the number of parahumans fighting was no doubt mind-boggling. Why make a point of this in particular?</p>
<p>To start with, today was the day Weld returned to Gimel after some time elsewhere. We’ve been told he was doing a combination of work in Earth Bet and spending some time touring other worlds in the company of the mass-murderer codenamed ‘Garotte’ and a pair of unnamed capes the two were friendly with. He was extended an offer to join the Wardens as a leader of one of the group’s cells, and he accepted.</p>
<p>People are applauding, it seems. Weld led a rather formidable team of monstrous capes away from the field of battle, at that critical point in our recent history. He came back practically alone, his team gone. He’s tight-lipped as to why.</p>
<p>His Wards team didn’t do very well either, for the record. We haven’t heard the full story from him there either. He claimed that he didn’t want to disparage his former employer, and that they were still on positive terms.</p>
<p>Does he deserve the position?<br>
Is he trustworthy?<br>
Is he even that good of a cape or a leader?</p>
<p>I’ll remind you of two of his favorite words, while you mull over those questions.</p>
<p>“No comment.”</p>

Nobody is saying why things happened like they did. Some are hinting @ it tho.<br>
A lot are hinting at it. Conspiracy of silence.<br>
Weld seems to know things and like the article says he’s keeping his mouth shut.<br>
It is his right to keep quiet. It is our right to say he’s an asshole for doing it.</p>

Guys guys guys. this is a hit piece and it’s a bad one at that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Full disclosure: I know Weld some. he was and is one of my favorite people</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But come the fuck on. Everyone has a motivation driving them. skimming through the comments on this article makes that v. clear. YES absolutely wonder at weld’s motivations. wonder about everyone’s. wonder about the people who are pushing hard for moving forward and about the people who want to go back to the way things were. wonder about the person who wrote this article and why he has the focus he does.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">but don’t make the mistake of focusing so much on the question marks that you forget about the other punctuation marks &amp; if someone shows you who they are then believe them. Weld’s teammates in Boston and Brockton Bay only had nice things to say about him. Period. Weld did charity work with kids he definitely didn’t have to do. Period. Weld served as team leader for a city in need and he kept his wards alive thru the Slaughterhouse Nine and God knows what else&mdash; exclamation mark.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weld has never shown himself to be anything but decent. if you’re filling in the blanks or raising questions then take your cue from that first &amp; foremost.</p>

Silence isn’t an option. Things are heating up, people are scared and we’re scared for a justifiable reason. Powers came out, and we started seeing broken powers. People with mutations, people with no off switch. Monsters who needed to be quarantined. Endbringers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Now we’ve got a different kind of broken power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It keeps getting worse. It gets worse in a linear and steady way. These things follow from one another. There is a visible pattern and there is a sense to be made of things. The new broken powers follow from the people made monstrous by their powers. If Weld knows something we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> to ask.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> authorities. We have no system of government. We have no national cape team or licensed heroes. We can’t even agree on a name for Gimel’s megalopolis!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can discuss all day but at some point we need to make decisions. We need to say we deserve to know and if you won’t tell us then no you can’t represent us and no we won’t trust you to have our back.</p>

@ Capricorn &mdash; I think you have some bias you’re not admitting to here. You disappeared too, didn’t you? You left Reach and disappeared. A couple of your old teammates are saying they’re thinking about joining the Attendant and you’re not included in that. Why? Are we supposed to use your metrics to evaluate you? Go by the face you presented to the public?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I think I’d rather read between the lines. Your old team doesn’t want you for a reason</p>

1000000000s of human beings died or have yet to make their way to us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1000000000s.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1000000000s of humans with families. mothers and fathers. good days and bad days.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">i say 1000000000s instead of billions because billions barely sounds different from millions and i think the zeroes drive it home</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">the city is as big as it is because we were lucky. we only lost about half of those close to us in N.E. US.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">refugees of Earth Shin say a parahuman took over their Earth a decade ago. one woman. she went back home to continue ruling them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">there is a world not far from us which is at constant war. there are tears in reality they can use to reach us and they have a lot of incentive to do so. they have parahumans too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">there is a theocratic state which is more distant but they have some parahumans too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">there is a world of monsters like Weld and his irregulars.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">there are others, smaller. there are probably others who we haven’t been told about.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">every week we get a handful of reports of people triggering with broken powers. They burn bright and burn fast and they do a lot of damage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">on the smallest level we are quiet and still because we are afraid to disturb the peace. but on the big level our new neighbors aren’t focused 100% on us. we’re important. we’re a powerful few even though we lost 1000000000s. the tyrant queen is looking at us but also watching over her shoulder for the war world and the monsters and the broken triggers. the war world is wanting to venture out but maybe an expedition is hard to field and they get broken triggers too. they’re getting more regular triggers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">the truce will break, both on the small level and the big</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">we are hurting from the loss of 1,000,000,000s and we are only just now reaching the point where we need to make decisions. what do we call ourselves? what direction do we go? Do we move forward or backward?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Like i said we are smaller in number than we should be. we’re hurting. we’re distracted and scattered.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">but i think we have the most powers at our disposal. that’s important.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and i think we’re best equipped to have the answers when others come asking. i think that’s the most important thing by far. they are going to ask and we are going to want to have answers to offer them</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">i think we need people to start telling instead of hinting. information is the most valuable resource at all.</p>

Information is also more volatile than oil, nitro, or nuclear material. Look at the secret identity leaks going on in this thread. Targeted harassment of Weld &amp; others. If hundreds or thousands agree to keep quiet about things then maybe there’s a reason.</p>

Humanity has seen its worst test yet and it came out the other side.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’d like to draw a comparison. I’ve read some of these pages and I see an effort to make us out to be the enemy. the monstrous capes are this mysterious thing and some of us are made out to know things that we aren’t saying</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I can tell you who we are. just like you we’re scarred. we were hurt very badly and altered very dramatically and we didn’t get to know why. we desperately wanted answers because our histories friends and families were taken from us. we were forced out of our homes and thrust into a strange place and many of us were left desperate or dangerous. Just like some of you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We learned some partial truths and that made things worse. Then after a very long time and a lot of pain we learned most of the rest of the truth.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I won’t pretend its easy. I struggled every day and then I struggled more after the end of the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But we fought a hard fight whether it was to save the world or to get to safety or to climb out of dark angry depths. We came out the other side. Every day we survive is a day we can say “I was THAT strong so I can definitely survive this.” Replace I with WE because we are all together in this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I don’t know if that will work for you but it helped me</p>

Posted on August 23rd Y1:</p>
<p>I would like to thank you all for reading this. I was invited to post here by Quasi after I posted in some other places. Quasi has been talking to me and resurring me.</p>
<p>I remember hearing about the monster heroes and I never payed much attention to them. Now I think I am one.</p>
<p>My name is Casey Forks and I would be starting high school this fall if things hadn’t gone bad. My mom hasn’t been well for a long time and my brother has the same condition so we decided to stick it out and whether things. we had a shelter and we had some food. my dad and I went to stores and raided them for more foods that would last and we stocked up.</p>
<p>The shelter didn’t work out. we all got headaches and dad said the air filters weren’t sufficent. we went upstairs into the house and sealed all the gaps and dad tried to fix up the filters. long story short that didn’t work out either. I should have tried to get somewhere safe but I stayed. I shouldn’t have stayed.</p>
<p>I didn’t think enough about monster capes or about those with powers but now I am both. Maybe I am not Casey anymore. I am frozen like the dead people who have lying on the ground for the years since the world ended, like a mummy without bandages. Mold grows on me and grows around me and it covers everything I can see and think about. I am a god of death and decay and I am an open fridge door with mold growing inside it and spilling out. with every passing day and hour and minute I am less like casesy and more a god of gross fridge stuff. my world of mold gets bigger every moment</p>
<p>I grew mold on my dads body and I could make him move. I grew mold on his brain and I got him to think and with his thinking I finally got the generator and the router and the phones working. It helped that I grew mold on the pieces and parts.</p>
<p>Now I am making my sister type because I cannot move any part of me a milimeter and I am asking heroes for help. I’m internet famous and there are articles written about my situation so that gives me some hope</p>
<p>But more importantly I am trying not to lose my mind. Quasi is helping me with that and he said you would all help by sharing your stories.</p>
<p>I am so scared that the heroes won’t save me but I am just as scared they’ll save me but they won’t be able to fix me. I am scared that I won’t be able to move. I am scared I won’t be able to hug a pretty girl or lie next to her in bed. I never cared about the rude stuff that much I thought that the cuddling would be the nicest part. I want to see the world through eyes that aren’t moldy and to take a deep breath and scream or even laugh. I want to play soccer again with all my friends there and I want my parents to be there and be proud.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tell me I’ll be ok.</span></p>

Be strong brother. With powers all things are possible. Through trauma and struggle we find ourselves so much stronger. It takes time to adjust and it takes time and effort to find the right keys to the right locks. With help (and you have so much help!) Clocks can be turned back and flesh can be reshaped. We killed a god and the worst is behind us. Slowly but surely we will put the pieces back together. If I did not believe this 100% then I would not be here to write this message to you. Be strong.</p>

I read some of your old posts Casey. when you fractured your ankle playing soccer you were worried you would never play again but you got there. When powers are involved the lows are so much lower but the highs are high enough to make it all so very worth it. You are funny, smart and cool and people wouldn’t be rooting for you if you weren’t. Your fears echo mine when I realized what had happened to me. I worried I would never have control or have a boy next to me or anything else. I can tell you it is possible.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: geez K, that’s not funny…<br>
Weird_Insect: …we’re using short-form names btw, S.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> Oh I see. I don’t really see the point but ok</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: sorry</p>

Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> It put a smile on my face K.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: here we are. it’s really good to see you, S. Keyboard got?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> I got my fancy keyboard. Everything fine tuned. Saw the worlds. Spent time with my favorite person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: speaking of</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> it’s ok. he’s tough.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> thank you for rooting for him.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> it meant a lot to see your name there.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> I see the anger and the agitation and I think really people are not complaining about what they are complainng about.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: How is Weld doing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> Hes good. Hard to tell sometimes because he is so strong. Emotionally. He busy but good. New position means a lot even if I can’t go with him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: You’re with us</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> Absolutely</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: things are stirring. world is about to shift. we ride the wave.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: we have work to do first. organization to do. things to figure out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: (he’s so different online)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: don’t start cap.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> did I miss much?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: someone put a hit out on me. that’s fun</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> !?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: It’s no big deal. Nothing is happening just yet. You’ve been gone 5 days?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> 5 days. Weld left to go talk to people and brought me with. we had to wait for keyboard order so we got a boat and permission and went looking. Tried to find my place of birth. no luck but was some of the best days of my life</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: I’ll take that as a challenge. see if we can’t top your boat trip.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> you didn’t make any major decisions?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: No. we wanted to wait for everyone. Cap saw you online and figured it was you. he got ahold of R and I made sure the others stuck around.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I wouldn’t have let them either for the record. you’re one of my favorite people</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> Thank you, C. *hugs K*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil<strong>:</strong> *dies*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: it means a lot to me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: Strength in numbers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: Not in numbers.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: I don’t think so.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: I think its strength in difference. We all stand at different angles and places. See things differently. we can support one another and hold each other up because of that. but we have commonalities. A and me. K and me. K and C. R and B.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: T&amp;A.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Haha</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: !!!!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: oh my god, C. you can’t go being funny like that. you’re not allowed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: I’ll PM you to explain, A.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: No need. I didn’t think it’s funny.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: thank you, A…<br>
Weird_Insect: …it was a lame lame joke…<br>
Weird_Insect: …rest of you don’t laugh too much or I am going to quit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: we’re doing this because we work together.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: It’s been weird not having you around, s. I think the balance is defintely something we need to keep an eye on</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: Balance 100%.<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: we represent the lead we want others to follow<br>
<strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar</strong>: stability</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Cap: yeah</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> strength</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: Absolutely.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> cooperation</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">of5: Yep</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> and honesty and good health and kindness and moving forward and all of that junk. I feel really awkward now because people keep saying yes and now there are expectations and I feel like there’s an order to it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: all that junk, yes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: Don’t feel awkward! no expectations. Well, some. but is good. we should have you be leader for this project and do the speeches.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> I am not a leader. Let me think on the speeches<strong><br>
Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> and I’m really tired of pulling on these knobs especially after all the travel. I think I’m going to get myself free and find another.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: nobody say it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heart_Shaped_Pupil: another knob? ! ! !</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Weird_Insect: damn it, K</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> He’s definitely not a knob<strong><br>
Kraken_in_a_Jar:</strong> I’ll probably see you all online at some point. if I don’t I’ll see you at the next meeting. Soon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mangled_Wings: Soon</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Hi.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: Hi. How can I help?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Thank you<br>
FlippinMad: I’ve been thinking about things for a long time and I’ve been digging for info and answers and trying to put it all together. Is hard because people don’t want to talk about things and a lot of people don’t want to talk to me in particular. People get upset</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: The world ended. It’s kind of upsetting</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I know. I know<br>
FlippinMad: you were there?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: We were all there toward the end. Very few exceptions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: thousands of capes were there and nobody wants to talk about the specifics</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: The answer will come out in time. It may already be out there in places. Communication is limited. Pockets of humanity are spread out and the people who have a say in info getting from city A to city B are probably wanting to keep things peaceful for now. Gov’t or what we have that passes for gov’t, PHO and the 12ish other online bodies…<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: they control info. But they can’t stop word of mouth. Not easily. We will hear the full story one day. I don’t know if it will be a good day but we will hear it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Ok<br>
FlippinMad: I’m stressing about it so I’m not sure if I can wait<br>
FlippinMad: Can I ask questions and you can decide if you want to say or not?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: you can ask. I can’t promise any answers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Thank you<br>
FlippinMad: Did you know Skitter? Weaver I guess</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: I didn’t know her. Not really<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: We crossed paths.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: She’s one of the people I ask people about and they get mad or defensive. Or they tell me they have something to do and never get back to me</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Why?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: Short answer: I can’t/won’t say</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Okay</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: Longer answer: I don’t know how things unfolded, but I think people fall into types and categories. I don’t know enough to say one way or the other but I think she was looking for something.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I don’t know if I understand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: You’ve seen the video stuff?<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky</strong>: She hurt someone you know?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I tried to find everything I could get. I’ve seen the cell phone movie from the cafeteria. I saw a few. not just the big one that was on the news. Then I went back to find other news and footage. Then I followed along<br>
FlippinMad: Her joining the heroes and later with her talking to schoolkids but there wasn’t much good video with that second one. I saw the movie of her in New Delhi and I saw her on TV here and there.<br>
FlippinMad: She hurt people I care about I guess. That’s not why I’m asking</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I’ve seen the same. I saw her as the novice warlord<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She hurt an awful lot of people. A crazy lot.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She killed one of our best heroes<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She also joined the Levi fight. She apparently helped against the S9. She joined the Wards<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> It’s hard to reconcile</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: That’s my problem<br>
FlippinMad: I want to figure it out but there are gaps</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I don’t have the answers for you. I can only theorize<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  I read a thread on PHO a few days ago and it made me think. I said I think she’s someone who was looking hard for an answer. I think she was wounded and lost and for this reason &amp; probably because of other factors she did a lot of damage while looking. The people she was with. Things being primed for everything to fall down. Timing or bad luck. Personality.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Wounded</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  I’m looking at my history and I’m having trouble finding the thread<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  there are people who are searching I think and there are people who just are. I think both can be good and both can be toxic. Some people are searching because of something that pushed them. A lot of capes just are. Some are doing the pushing, instead. And there’s all sorts of types.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  I don’t know her nearly well enough to say which she was but I don’t think she stood still. Or when she did stand still it was because she was on a precipice, looking for a push or for something to push. But again I don’t know her.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  You would have to explain more about what you want to know for me to give you any more of an answer</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I pushed her</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> You pushed her?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I really hope you don’t block me or ignore me<br>
FlippinMad: I’ll try to explain but give me a moment.<br>
FlippinMad: Do you remember me? We met a few times but I think the only time we had a conversation was before the Vice-Versa photoshoot. There were six of us who were around the same age and the designers were taking a while.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong>  I remember that. A bunch of non-capes from around the city, dressed up as capes, some of us local capes in fancy dress. Skitter wasn’t a part of that, obviously.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Yeah. I’m starting back at the beginning<br>
FlippinMad: They picked top athletes, valedictorians, bunch of others.<br>
FlippinMad: You were hanging out with us. Shadow Stalker and the rest of us were joking around.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I remember now. Emma?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Her friend. I’m the short one. It was her biggest shoot ever and she was super psyched. I tagged along. We were joking around and you were laughing with us and the staff were running around freaking out and trying to do last minute costume changes<br>
FlippinMad: You were in fancy clothes and you had one of those masks on a stick, and Clockblocker was nearby complaining about having to hold his mask up until Ageis (sp?) got some ribbon and tied it to his head for him, which made the hairdresser freak out</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Aegis<strong><br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> They catered those nonalcoholic soda cocktails with layered colors. We drank them like they were water<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> and the one woman’s eyes bugged out when she saw what the bill was. I felt so sorry for her.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> We gave the staff so much grief.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: But that was part of the fun<br>
FlippinMad: Yeah. It was like a dream, hanging out with heroes and cool people. Everyone was so fancy, including my friend. It was the one time in my life where I felt like I was one of the teens in one of those overly polished scenes in a teen movie where everyone looks so perfect<br>
FlippinMad: I was really really hoping that they were going to just pull me in as an extra<br>
FlippinMad: Because one of the kids they’d invited had backed out.<br>
FlippinMad: But it didn’t look like it was going to happen and I was having enough fun that I didn’t mind too much. I said things and people laughed at it. And everything was great until then</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I said something didn’t I?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: You called us a bunch of bitches</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> That was it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: You said ‘This was such a nice night and you c-words had to spoil it by being disgusting. Come on.’<br>
FlippinMad: and then you walked away and most of the heroes and heroines went with you or whatever. Leaving just me and Emma and a couple of others.<br>
FlippinMad: They 100% went into…<br>
FlippinMad: I don’t know what you call it. Defense mode. They wanted to bring things back to center. Normalize. They were saying things like “what’s bugging her? We weren’t saying anything that bad”<br>
FlippinMad: And I was sitting there being quiet and I remember thinking they were wrong. we were kind of being bitches and we were kind of going too far when ragging on people who weren’t there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> The disabled girl I think. We were having to wait because they were having to adjust her costume to work around her back brace.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Yeah.<br>
FlippinMad: We said something loud enough for her to hear from the other end of the room and you spoke up and then you went to go hang with her instead<br>
FlippinMad: The night didn’t seem as magical after all that. I was really bothered.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I barely remember beyond that. I did the photoshoot and we tried to cheer the girl up. It was mostly great and I saw Emma a few times after that and there were no problems but we weren’t friendly</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: It was the first time in my life I stopped and took stock and asked myself “am I a good person?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> To an extent you get a pass. To an extent. We were 13-20 I think. You were closer to 13 than 20. Teenagers are shitty and most teenagers make a couple of mistakes. Not excusing it. It sucked as a thing. But teenagers being asshats mitigates it</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: No<br>
FlippinMad: I was really fucking shitty.<br>
FlippinMad: I think its worse because I had this wake up call and I asked myself if I was a good person<br>
FlippinMad: Except I never got around to answering that question. I kept putting it off and feeling shitty about it<br>
FlippinMad: We kept being bitches. And then a couple months after that we put Taylor in the hospital. Skitter. I don’t know if she had powers then but if she did then I don’t know why she didn’t murder us all</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> You’re the bullies that pushed her over the edge</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Me and Emma and our friend Sophia and Julia and a few others. But we were the main three or four</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I feel dumb not connecting those dots before. Preoccupied atm and I was preoccupied then. Fuck me. Emma was one of them? They kept your names out of the media</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Word still got out.<br>
FlippinMad: So this is where I am because I almost feel responsible? Or I don’t know if I’m responsible<br>
FlippinMad: But we pushed her<br>
FlippinMad: And after that she joined bad guys and robbed a bank<br>
FlippinMad: And then somewhere after that the empire got upset at her and her group and called them out before attacking the city and RIGHT after that the Endbringer attacked.<br>
FlippinMad: There were all these theories about why it attacked Brockton Bay and the big two were that there was a holy grail or something? I didn’t follow that one. They said it might have to do with why people wanted to control the city?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> A target. Something that would make the city valuable. Or someone. Endbringers have gone after specific people before</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Ok. I don’t know. The other one was that the city saw so much fighting in a short time. Taylor was a part of that and I’m part of what pushed her out there<br>
FlippinMad: I know I sound narcissistic and shit but…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Are you gonna finish that sentence?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I don’t know. I feel responsible<br>
FlippinMad: I was pretty much there at the beginning and I pushed her and…<br>
FlippinMad: it feels like I was at the top of a hill and I pushed a rock down it and it rolled down out of sight<br>
FlippinMad: and then this rockslide starts further down the hill and wipes out a town and kills this really important person and a whole bunch of other horrible things.<br>
FlippinMad: …and I go looking and my rock is lying there in the devastation. Nobody’s saying what happened. her wiki page is gone and people get annoyed or upset when I ask. I want to know what happened when I couldn’t see. Every non-answer I get makes it worse</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She was her own person. She made her own decisions along the line.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I know that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> You don’t own her. You don’t own every decision she made or the whole fallout<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I know. But I didn’t help matters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> No. You definitely own some of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: And you can’t tell me what happened.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I can’t &amp; won’t. But I guess I can say this.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> With the evidence we have we know she did some good things. She did some bad things. She did some incredibly controversial things. She was more vicious and ruthless than she needed to be maybe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Am I responsible for that extra viciousness and ruthlessness?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Can’t say. Neither can you. But it probably didn’t fill her with smiles and joy did it?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I spat on her once. It was Emma who really got to her and Sophia who went out of her way to hurt her. I was…<br>
FlippinMad: I put her backpack in the toilet once. Books, notebooks and all. The water was clear but it was still the toilet and yeah. I put glue on her desk and juice on her seat and I stood by when the others were doing the worst stuff.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Fucking why?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I don’t know. I never really stopped to think about it. My friend was a model and my other friend was a top athlete. Maybe I wanted to keep up. I told myself it was prank tier stuff but at the same time<br>
FlippinMad: I’m saying this because this is like I’m confessing but like…<br>
FlippinMad: Some time between when that photoshoot happened and when we put her in the hospital we were talking. Emma Sophia Julia and I. We figured we were falling into a pattern and we kept knocking her down when she picked herself up too much.<br>
FlippinMad: and I had this moment where I saw she was really low and I spat on her. I remember the look on her face<br>
FlippinMad: what the hell was wrong with me? I didn’t wake up to what I was doing until I got fucking caught which is just so doubly shitty. My parents found out when we all got called to school and that was the last time I interacted with Taylor. Moved away with Leviathan.<br>
FlippinMad: I fucking spat on her face</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Stop now please</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: ok</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Ok.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> If you kept going I would’ve closed this and left you to it. Now I’m going to try to give you your answer here. Ok?<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Even though you probably don’t deserve it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Yeah</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Draw your own conclusions. Look at who she was and extrapolate. She did good she did bad. As time passed yes the bad things might have faded some but the controversial stuff she did might have gotten worse. Extrapolate.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: You’re saying that’s what happened? At the end. She did some good and she did some bad but she did something super controversial?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I am saying *nothing*. I am suggesting that if you are wondering what happened when you couldn’t see then you can make some educated guesses.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She killed people. She hurt people. She may have played a part in a war over the city. She threatened innocents with bugs and choked more than one person to death or nearly to death by shoving spiders and centipedes down their throats. She killed Alexandria at a time when we needed Alexandria most. <strong><br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She consorted with rapists terrorists and monsters.<strong><br>
Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> And because it eneds to be said yes she became a hero. That counts for something maybe. Maybe she had to. Maybe not.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She was there at the end and whatever she did, nobody will speak of it, at least for now. Fill in the blank<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Now she’s gone and you’re still here.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Gone?<br>
FlippinMad: she retired? Or she’s dead? Gone gone?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She is *gone*.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> But listen to me. because you made the choices and you carried on when you could’ve stopped and you spat on her and I’m not ignoring that. I’ve been holding back so I can get to it now.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I’m listening</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> She was all of those things and she might have still been a better person than you<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: …</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Feel shitty? Good. Is it weighing on you or eating at you or making you wonder? Fucking good. That’s the way it should be.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Carry it. Own it. Make allowances for the fact that you were a teenager but don’t you dare excuse it or ignore it<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> If owning it means you assume the worst case scenario? that you pushed her and she took action and that line of action ended in the end of the world being uglier than they needed to be? Fine. Make do.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Maybe things would be better. Maybe they would be worse. Maybe someone else would have taken the same role. Maybe we would all be dead. You might not ever get a clean answer and that might be her justice against you</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Yeah</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> All this I’m saying? I feel like I can say it because I have my own regrets and misdeeds. I’m trying to own them just like I’m telling you to. I didn’t fucking spit on a girl when she was already having a bad day or make fun of a disabled girl on what should’ve been one of the top ten days of her life but I could probably make a priest’s jaw drop if I were the type to visit a confessional<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I’m not giving you advice I wouldn’t take myself<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Carry it. Take it with you and use it as motivation to make things better. We need a fucking lot of that motivation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: I’m training to be a teacher</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Then I hope 10x as much that you own this and learn from it<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Yeah<br>
FlippinMad: Thats kind of the plan. I want to anyway but the school turned me down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Anything else?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: When do I get to put this behind me? When do I get forgiven or get to forgive myself?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> You’re asking me? Never.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I don’t believe in forgive &amp; forget. Not for the things I’ve done. not for what others have done to people I care about. Not for what’s been done to me.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> The moment we forget is the moment we allow those wrongs to be done again.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Forgiveness is the easy way out. Less to carry.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: That doesn’t seem fair</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Villains outnumbered the heroes. Now heroes outnumber villains. Allegedly. People lost everything and they didn’t deserve to. Some people get powers and some don’t. Things are the furthest thing from fair.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Maybe it’s not fair that she’s gone and you’re here.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Maybe you will get the answer about what happened and you’ll feel better and that’ll be unfair because you shouldn’t.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Maybe the opposite is true and no good answer will come out and she’ll be forgotten without tombstone or anything else.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I expect we’ll get the answer and it’ll be an unhappy compromise between the two</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: It doesn’t seem fair to yourself I mean</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I’ll handle me. You handle you. You focus on making sure no girl you teach gets spat on, short girl from the photoshoot.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> It’s easy enough to keep something moving once it’s already moving, but getting it going in the first place is hard. That’s the thing about second chances and fresh starts. It’s a (re)start. You gotta get things moving all over again, the second time around.<br>
<strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> Let’s try to make sure things are moving in the right direction. Alright? Deal?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: Alright.<br>
FlippinMad: Not quite the response I expected</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Point_Me_@_The_Sky:</strong> I had the impression it’s the response you were asking for</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">FlippinMad: You might be right.<br>
FlippinMad: Thanks</p>

<p>Ward is the second work in the Parahumans series, and reading <strong><a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/">Worm</a></strong> first is strongly recommended. A lot of this won’t make sense otherwise and if you do find yourself a fan of the universe, the spoilers in Ward will affect the reading of the other work.</p>
<p>Ward is not recommended for young or sensitive readers.</p>
<p><strong>⊙</strong></p>
<p>It was a second chance for humanity as a whole, and they’d gone and screwed it up from the start by coloring the city <em>gold</em>, of all colors.</p>
<p>The skyline was a half-and-half mix of skyscrapers and buildings in progress. The latter were skeletons of tall buildings in the process of being filled in and put together, and hazard signs, tarps, the materials that made up the countless cranes and the painted letters on steel girders were all in bright yellows. The completed skyscrapers were paneled with mirrored or reflective glass that were tinted in that same hue. All put together, the light that bounced off of the city and reached skyward gave the clouds linings that were gold, not silver.</p>
<p>It was such a fucking shame that it had to be the case, intentional or not.</p>
<p>My phone was buzzing with texts. I pulled it from my skirt pocket and looked while I walked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Parental Unit 1:</b><b><br>
</b>BBQ tonight with everyone<br>
My house<br>
Can you come?</p>
<p>I glanced around to make sure I wasn’t going to walk into anyone, then stepped off the sidewalk, into a gap between two display windows that bowed out and forward. In front of me, an assortment of people walked. People in business clothes walked briskly, while some elderly people meandered. A whole herd of kids were hurrying off to school.</p>
<p>I typed out my reply.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Me:</b><b><br>
</b>That’s short notice</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Parental Unit 1:<br>
</b>Michael is swinging by<br>
There has been talk of everyone getting together.<br>
It seemed worth trying to arrange<br>
If you can’t come that’s ok I understand</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Me:<br>
</b>If I didn’t come, would be because of work. New semester &amp; lots to do. Might come very late</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Parental Unit 1:<br>
</b>Spur of moment thing that is almost pulled together<br>
Only missing you<br>
Not to guilt you ha ha</p>
<p>Ha ha. She never liked using shorthand like ‘lol’.</p>
<p>No. No guilt at all, mom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>Parental Unit 1:<br>
</b>Come if you can<br>
Will save you dessert just in case</p>
<p>My typed reply was interrupted by a crash. The stride of every person on the sidewalk in front of me and every person on the other side of the street was interrupted, as they stopped, heads turning.</p>
<p>I put the phone away, the message half finished. The impact had been at the nearest intersection, where a smaller road cut through one of the downtown areas. I had to push through the bystanders closest to the scene to get there, and I could hear the victim’s wail of distress before I was halfway through.</p>
<p>A car accident. There were no injuries, and I couldn’t see blood. Nothing suggested that anyone had died. Not that anyone would have guessed by the sounds the man was making.</p>
<p>A teenager stood outside her car, the front corner and passenger-side mirror trashed. She’d hit one of the pillars that lined the street.</p>
<p>An older man was doubled over, but he was on the far side of the pillar, not a location that suggested he could have been hit. He was elderly, with gray hair that still had color in it. Two people had already drawn close to him, supporting him while he knelt, rocking slightly in place. The sound he made was the heartbroken, strained sound that people made when they couldn’t even draw in a full breath.</p>
<p>Such shitty, shitty bad luck, that he’d been here when the collision happened.</p>
<p>‘Pillar’ was the wrong word, but the right word felt wrong. ‘Monument’ implied something huge, but it was barely taller than I was, maybe three feet across at the base, tapering to two feet across at the top. Plaques were recessed into three of the four faces &mdash; the fourth had come free and fallen after the collision. Each plaque bore an etching of a face, a name, a date of birth, a date of death, a message.</p>
<p>I looked down the length of the one-lane road. There were as many pillars as there were trees, and there were a lot of trees, enough that the sunlight that peeked past them was dappled. This pillar was one of what had to be over a thousand that had been set throughout the city by now, punctuating quaint streets and surrounding parks. Places that were nice.</p>
<p>They were part of an initiative by an independent cape, a hero turned rogue, helping out.</p>
<p>There could easily be a thousand more of these pillars before the year was over, that number repeated every year thereafter, and if that work continued for another fifty or a hundred years, there wouldn’t be a pillar for one percent of the people we’d lost. Not even if ‘we’ were just the people who hailed from the northeastern U.S..</p>
<p>The girl who’d been driving the car had a thousand-yard stare as she faced down the small crowd. She looked like she’d just hit a real person and reality was sinking in.</p>
<p>The wailing stopped. People were consoling the old man, some shooting hard looks at the girl who didn’t seem to be registering much of anything.</p>
<p>“Hey,” I called out.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to register that I was talking to her, as she stared at the lower portion of the pillar that had crumbled, stone chunks broken away, cracks webbing across the surface.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” I asked her.</p>
<p>She nodded, said, “I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>The old man looked up at her.</p>
<p>People in the crowd were staring, apparently angry on the old man’s behalf. One hapless teenager and thirty or forty very upset people.</p>
<p>“Listen,” I told her. “Stay close by, okay? I’m sure someone in the crowd there is calling for help&mdash;”</p>
<p>Someone in the crowd raised a hand to get my attention. They had a phone to their ear.</p>
<p>“&mdash;They’re calling for help. They’ll be here shortly. Don’t go anywhere, you can explain what happened, alright?”</p>
<p>That seemed to get through to her. She nodded again, retreating to her car, apparently to sit in the front seat. Good. That was handled.</p>
<p>Until she stopped at the door, turned around, and addressed the old man and the crowd, “I’m really goddamn sorry I broke your thing.”</p>
<p>The grieving man rose to his feet, stepping forward at the same time. He pulled away from the supporting hands of the people around him, his face contorting.</p>
<p>I stepped in his way, my arm out. He pushed forward, and I caught him in a half-hug with one arm, stopping him. He reached out and tried to push me aside, and I caught his arm.</p>
<p>He was a guy, but he was an elderly guy. It wasn’t much of a contest. The moment he met resistance, he sagged, and I did what I could to keep him from outright collapsing as he slowly sank to his knees again, sobbing openly.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to turn him a fraction so he wouldn’t be looking at the girl or the pillar as he knelt there.</p>
<p>In the background, that girl seemed to flounder in shock, useless, not sure what to do with herself in the face of this moment of violent grief.  She looked at me, but I didn’t want to say anything that might agitate the man I was dealing with. She looked to the crowd, and she saw only angry stares.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what she’d seen, if it was a motion from someone, a particular emotion on a particular face, but she found the reason to get moving again, getting into the car, slamming the door behind her. The man I was holding jumped at the sound.</p>
<p>The man stopped resisting altogether. It had been a fast enough change in attitude that I had to wonder at what he would have done if I hadn’t intervened. Shouted in her face? Grabbed her? Would he have lashed out and struck the girl? If he would’ve gone so far as to use violence, would it have been relentless, requiring people to pull him off, or would he have stopped the moment he was interrupted?</p>
<p>I gradually relaxed my hold on him.</p>
<p>The crowd, too, seemed to realize that the situation had mostly de-escalated. The girl was in her car, the old man wasn’t an apparent danger to himself or others so long as I was here. That was enough for the assembled group to start breaking up.</p>
<p>I stepped back, hands partially raised in case he started forward again, and to enable me to act if he seemed like he might fall. I couldn’t just say the pillar would get fixed, or that things would be okay. The old man hadn’t shed tears for the pillar.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to say ‘sorry’, and echo the kid in the car.</p>
<p>I almost asked if there was anyone I could call. I stopped myself when I realized the answer could be no.</p>
<p>“How about we get away from here?” I asked, keeping my voice soft. “We can go grab a coffee or tea, and you and I can talk.”</p>
<p>The man looked at me, as if just now realizing there was a person right next to him.</p>
<p>“It’s got to be better than violence,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t &mdash; I’m not violent,” he said, sounding very small.</p>
<p>The heads of the crowd turned in reaction to something outside my field of view, and the old man’s head turned as well.</p>
<p>Behind me, it seemed. A man in costume. It was a good outfit, too, more in the dollars that had been put into it than in terms of looks, but that was personal opinion. Partial discs of metal seemed to intersect his body, forming a look where he looked like a blender caught mid-whirl, axe blades and metal rings jutting from his breastplate, armguards, leg armor, and even his face, with blades running along one brow and cheekbone to frame one eye.</p>
<p>There were heavier blades at his hands and feet, such that it looked like he shouldn’t be able to walk or even stand without difficulty. As it was, he had one end of his long-handled axe resting on the ground, the length of it bowing beneath his weight as he perched on it, one arm outstretched to one side, hand gripping the head. He was crouching on the thing while it rested at a diagonal, in a way that looked like he’d wipe out if the end of the weapon lost traction on the roadtop.</p>
<p>Fuck me. Not what we needed right now.</p>
<p>The old man started to stand. I helped him.</p>
<p>“Can I do anything to help?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” I said. “Minor accident, we’re just waiting for cops to come and assess things, take numbers.”</p>
<p>I was barely done speaking when someone in the crowd said, “We don’t need you.”</p>
<p>I watched him glance over the small crowd, looking for the person who had spoken. He kept looking out for the speaker as he told us, “There’s some police on their way. With all the reconstruction and the lower priority, they’re trying to get through the traffic right now.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to know,” I said. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>He nodded. He looked deeply disturbed by the one comment he’d heard. I caught a glimpse of the emblem on his sleeve. A badge, not a personal symbol or icon, but part of the team he belonged to. Advance Guard. They were a team with an agenda to push. The world had ended, and they were pushing hard for a better and different tomorrow.</p>
<p>I could respect that.</p>
<p>I could also cringe inwardly at the fact that our superhero here was implicitly sporting a ‘move forward’ ideology when that was the last thing this old man probably wanted to hear with a freshly reopened emotional wound. Time and place. Unfortunately, because of the team emblem the cape had on his breast&mdash; a stylized figure holding a shield shaped like a greater-than symbol, the guy represented that ideology every time, in every place.</p>
<p>He walked over to the car, still watching the crowd, and he exchanged a few words with the girl in the driver’s seat. I was glad for that, at least. I had my hands full with the old guy and nobody else was stepping up to do it.</p>
<p>The cape stepped away from the car, looked at me and the old man. “He’s okay?”</p>
<p>“The pillar. It’s for his&mdash;” I started, looking at the plate on the pillar for a clue.</p>
<p>“Son. My son,” the man said.</p>
<p>“My condolences,” the hero said.</p>
<p>The man tensed. They were words that made it worse, not better, somehow.</p>
<p>“<i>Go,</i>” someone in the crowd said. A different person than the last. “We’re fine.”</p>
<p>The people that had been splintering away were holding position now. I could see the hostility. The summer heat was holding out through the start of September, making things just a little more uncomfortable, tempers a little shorter.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the hero said, more to himself.</p>
<p>It put me in mind of a scene from the history books and the grainy old news footage of an event from the mid-80s. Back in the day, when the superheroes could be counted on the fingers of both hands, there had been a riot over a sports match. The anger and chaos had outweighed the respect the rioters had for the hero that had stepped in. Someone had struck out with a blunt object and hit the hero. He’d died before he reached the hospital. We’d called him the second cape after Scion, but he might well have been the first, after all.</p>
<p>Did I think that would happen here? No. Too small a group, the emotions were different, there wasn’t enough chaos.</p>
<p>Still, the general setpieces were here. The barely restrained emotion. The lack of care. The ill-timed intervention of the man in costume. The lack of respect in particular was in play. For Vikare, it had been because so many people hadn’t truly believed the powers were real, and he had apparently held back to avoid scaring people.</p>
<p>For this cape from Advance Guard, it was the opposite. He’d gone all out, <i>we’d</i> gone all out. Capes still hadn’t been able to stop the world from ending.</p>
<p>We were back at the beginning in so many ways.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the hero said again. He seemed to wrestle with what he was going to say next before deciding on, “I’m going to go.”</p>
<p>I wanted there to be people in the crowd who spoke up. I wanted there to be other things besides this sentiment of hostility and rejection. For this guy and for all the rest of us. Were there any people who wanted to say something positive?</p>
<p>Nobody. Or if there was anyone, they were afraid to speak out against the herd. I didn’t want to leave it like this.</p>
<p>“Nice response time,” I said.</p>
<p>He turned my way and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“You showed up quick. It was impressive.”</p>
<p>He nodded, studying me as if trying to find the catch. “It’s what I do.”</p>
<p>I wanted to say something more, but I didn’t want to push my luck. It would have been nice if he’d been less dismissive when I was throwing him a bone.</p>
<p>“Take care,” he said. “Cops are on their way. I’ll go let them know what’s up.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said. “You take care too.”</p>
<p>He stepped down from the pole of his battleaxe and set foot on the road. Pavement splashed as if he’d stepped in a puddle. More splashed and rippled as he moved his axe in a circle around him.</p>
<p>When he took a step and moved, it was faster than I could track. I could see the splash that followed behind, a cresting wave that quickly settled, leaving only a faint wavy pattern in the road as it dissipated.</p>
<p>I’d spoken against the herd. I tried not to pay too much attention to them or give them any excuse to push back against me, instead turning my attention to the old man.</p>
<p>“I’m offering tea or coffee, my treat. We can talk it out, or talk about something else entirely,” I told him. “As soon as the police are done.”</p>
<p>He still looked like he was carrying that fresh pain, in expression and posture. He flinched some as he looked at his son’s memorial pillar. He gave the girl in the car a hard look, then seemed to let the anger out, sagging.</p>
<p>She was in the driver’s seat, both hands and forehead on the wheel.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “You’ll have some place to be. I shouldn’t keep you more than I have. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Work,” I said. “They wouldn’t fire me, especially if I explained. I’d get in trouble, maybe, but I wouldn’t mind much. Job is… a seven out of ten fit.”</p>
<p>“Seventy percent is a lot better than some are getting,” the man said. “Keep that job. I’ll manage now.”</p>
<p>I glanced at the girl in the car. She had barely moved.</p>
<p>“You’ll leave her alone?” I asked.</p>
<p>The old man heaved out a sigh.</p>
<p>“She’s a kid who made a stupid mistake,” I said, in case he was trying to come to a decision. “You don’t have to forgive her, but you can’t go and hurt her or anything.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have…” he said, and he didn’t finish the sentence. Because he might have, or because he didn’t know what he wouldn’t have done.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “That’s good.”</p>
<p>“Go. Work. Don’t let me keep you,” he said. “I’ll be straight with the police there.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stick around for the cops and then duck out.”</p>
<p>The police cars had appeared at the edge of the block, but with traffic on the narrow road slowed by the girl’s car, they’d stopped there. The cars couldn’t progress, but the police were getting out.</p>
<p>One officer went to talk to the girl, another to the old man. I waited around a minute, then gave a statement and my info.</p>
<p>As in most things having to do with law or bureaucracy, it took longer than it should have, for a relatively simple process. I hurried to the high school once they were done with me, and I arrived rather late.</p>
<p>High school.</p>
<p>We still weren’t at the point where we had nice lawns and yards. This schoolyard was no exception. We had grass and fields, yes, but it was coarse and the ground beneath wasn’t usually landscaped. The area was large with large trees left untouched in the corners, chain link fence separating the field from the roads on two sides, the grade school formed the third boundary to the west, and the high school formed the fourth boundary to the north. The ground was uneven, more hilly than flat, and there were still large stones here and there, and a seemingly out of place play structure for the grade schoolers.</p>
<p>It was an odd thing. So often, nature was transplanted into a city, and it was new and inauthentic, made overly neat. Trees, lawns, flowers. Here, the nature was rough and unpolished, the city itself new and somewhat artificial in how overly tidy it was, untouched by time or elements.</p>
<p>A sports field in the middle section separated the grade schoolers’ area from the theater. It was a stage in the old Roman style, slabs of stone set into the ground like stairs, stepping down as they got closer to the stage, where the platform sat.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students had gathered on the stone seats, and more stood around the top edge of the theater, watching and listening. They were our survivors, our next generation. Not so different from the crowd I’d had to deflect earlier. A third of them still wore the very simple clothes that were handed out with supplies in the tent cities. Some had even taken to strategically ripping and dressing up those clothes. I didn’t fault them for it. It was hot.</p>
<p>A speaker carried the voice to those of us on the top edge.</p>
<p>The teachers of the school were on the stage, but they weren’t speaking. It was a series of community leaders and volunteers instead.</p>
<p>“…And I make that a guarantee to you,” a man in an orange vest was saying. “If you take those credentials, bring good shoes and work clothes, and if you don’t screw around, you can walk into any lot and you can be working within the hour and get your pay by that day’s end. Good pay. You can do whatever you want, after school, but you’ll always have this as a fallback, you’ll have the security of being able to walk into a lot and have a job waiting for you. We can <em>always</em> use more hands.”</p>
<p>Not enough seats at this school either. High school was and might well continue to be a half-day thing. The people on the stage were telling the kids their other options for the other half of the day.</p>
<p>I spotted Gilpatrick on the stage. He wore a black t-shirt and gray pants with boots, and in the summer heat he was sweating a fair amount. He had no hair on his head, but he had a five o’clock shadow well before five o’clock, bushy eyebrows and thick hair on thick forearms. Everyone else looked like they were trying to make their best pitch, in dressing nice and wearing smiles. Gilpatrick looked like he was trying to scare his prospects away.</p>
<p>Some of the non-prospects were standing around the upper edge, looking down at the new students and the stage. Most were senior students who’d picked what they’d do with their half-days last year, now waiting to induct the others. Some were siblings of those seniors, or younger friends. Others were like me, miscellaneous staff for miscellaneous roles.</p>
<p>I joined them.</p>
<p>“We wondered if you’d bailed,” Jasper said. He was very much a teenager, with acne, thin chin-hair and black hair that had had product in it, that had turned spiky from sweat.</p>
<p>“Delayed by a car accident.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s okay?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yep.” <em>Insofar as anyone is okay.</em> “Has Gil done his five pounds of gun thing? I was kind of looking forward to it, it’s so corny.”</p>
<p>“I think he’s saving it for the deeper explanation later. He mostly talked about how he was going to make it his objective to make people quit, he isn’t going to pay anyone, job prospects suck, he’s going to make people march in the heat and the cold for miles while carrying unreasonable burdens. The ‘five pounds’ speech isn’t bad, you know. It gets through to the kids,” Jasper said. For all that he was defending the speech, he smirked a bit.</p>
<p>“It gets through to most,” Cubs said. He was a big guy, tall, broad-shouldered, fit, with his hair cut short. He thought for a second and then amended his statement, “some.”</p>
<p>“Us,” Jasper said.</p>
<p>“Guess so, yeah,” Cubs said.</p>
<p>I didn’t miss the glance he shot at the girl at the far end of our little sub-group. Cami wore an expression I might have termed ‘resting angry face’. Perpetually pissed.</p>
<p>All three of them, and many other members of the group besides, were dressed in similar shades as Gilpatrick. Blacks and grays.</p>
<p>“I’m going to duck into my office,” I said. “I want to check my email and make sure it’s nice and neat if anyone stops in.”</p>
<p>“Only a short bit before we migrate over,” Cubs said. “One more speaker.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let Gilpatrick know you’re there,” Jasper said. He extended a fist. I rolled my eyes and instead of tapping it with my own, pushed it away. Jasper smiled.</p>
<p>My destination wasn’t in the high school, but was across the street. It was an open building with a partial second floor. The main floor was hardwood, with mats folded and piled up at the side. A few more senior students were already there&mdash; some were just entering or leaving the showers. It seemed like a good idea for cooling down, but I didn’t have the time.</p>
<p>I waved at some of the seniors in passing and headed up the stairs. The stairwell ran up one wall, unbounded by barriers, so it offered a view of everything below.</p>
<p>My office was the closest thing I had to a home, in this world. It was narrow and long, with a bookshelf at the right wall, a desk, computer and chair. Some boxes were piled up in the corners.</p>
<p>The bookshelf was my accomplishment. My fingers ran along the spines of books and other texts. Many of the works were collections of articles or official documents, bound by hand with a three-hole punch, rings, and patience.</p>
<p>Parahuman science. University textbooks, old workbooks with notes&mdash; not all mine. There were important articles, copied to plain text and printed out, with a lean toward the sciences, the nuances, the big revelations and reveals.</p>
<p>Official files. Classification documents. Then there were the notes for case one, case fifteen, case thirty-two, case fifty-three, case ninety. The ‘cases’ were the events the PRT had deemed of interest. Riddles both solved and unsolved. My collection there was incomplete, but some were official enough to be confidential, and I’d never had that access. Others were closed, the mystery deemed nonexistent or something to be folded into popular knowledge.</p>
<p>I had other files. There were names on those files. Whittler, Bilious, King Crow were some of the many on the shelf I’d deemed ‘independents’. For teams, there were ones like the Ambassadors, Green Tea, N.N., Ossuary, Empire Eighty-Eight, and the Clans. I’d made it a priority to collect those. I worried we might need them.</p>
<p>On the bottom shelf, I had my magazines. Costumes Under Clothes, Gleam, Heroines, Masque, Shine On. Some of the boxes in the corner had my latest haul. Much of it would be duplicates. Maybe I’d give some of them out to seniors.</p>
<p>I could still smell a faint mildewy smell, and promised myself I’d identify the source when I had time. I’d left the window open, and the weather was warm, which was helping. A lot of this was what I’d salvaged from the office back home; I’d retrieved it from boxes and filing cabinets and hauled it here over a dozen trips. I’d rigged up tarps to keep the water off that corner of the house, but some of that moisture had been coming up from below. I would have to find the source of the smell and transcribe the text before throwing it out.</p>
<p>Maybe I could get Gilpatrick to get a kid who needed punishing to do it for me.</p>
<p>Information was too important. Even if that information was from the glossy, superficial magazines about superheroines that had been pitched to girls just like me eight to ten years ago.</p>
<p>Faint smells aside, I could draw in a deep breath and feel muscles from shoulder to calf relax. This was more of that seventy percent part of the seventy percent fit where the job suited me.</p>
<p>That thirty percent, though. I wouldn’t stay here forever. I hoped. It had been a thing that I’d hoped would look good on my college applications. That hadn’t worked.</p>
<p>I could hear the commotion as the mob of kids started coming in downstairs.</p>
<p>I walked over to my computer and booted it up. It booted up instantly, but the connection to the internet took a while. I opened a notebook and began searching through it.</p>
<p>I found the name before the internet succeeded in connecting. I closed the conversation from the day prior and waited for the internet before composing an email.</p>

I was a bystander when a car crashed into a pillar on Small St, near Basil Ave. Thought I’d let you know it’s damaged. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help or any info I can provide.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thanks for what you do.</p>
<p>I sent it, then stood, walking to the window. I didn’t have much of a view&mdash; mostly the side of a building and a bit of the alley. If I stuck my head out the window, I could see a sliver of the school and some of the street. Students were milling around, some undecided on where they were going.</p>
<p>My computer chimed.</p>

<b>Subject</b>: Re: Damaged Pillar<br>
I already heard. Advance Guard were on the scene and let me know. Will have it fixed tomorrow. Thanks.</p>
<p>That would be fixed soon then. I thought the things were an eyesore, really, but people clearly felt like they were important.</p>
<p>I was caught up in checking recent events online when there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>Gilpatrick.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be handing out guns to kids?” I asked. “Or giving a hard-assed speech that sends them running?”</p>
<p>“I wish,” he said. “Can’t give them guns until later. Give me a week, we’ll see how many of them I can get rid of. Can you show your face downstairs for me, so they know who to look for?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. “Let me get organized and I’ll be right there.”</p>
<p>He didn’t step out of the doorway. His arms remained folded, and he had paper in one of his hands, held where I might not notice it.</p>
<p>“…Actually,” he said.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. I gave him a stern look. “No. Don’t ‘actually’ me. Please.”</p>
<p>“Do you know anything about Fume Hood?”</p>
<p>I raised one eyebrow, keeping that stern look otherwise in place. “Fume Hood? No.”</p>
<p>“She apparently went by another name, a while back. Poison Apple?”</p>
<p>“Then I do know stuff. She went by Bad Apple,” I said. “And a few other Nom De Pommes. I know some of her story. She was controversial.”</p>
<p>“She’s a hero now,” he said. “She’s getting announced as one member of a new team today.”</p>
<p>I nodded slowly, taking that in. “That could be bad.”</p>
<p>“It’s looking like it will be,” Gilpatrick said. He revealed the papers. “Can you brief my seniors? Fill them in on who she is?”</p>
<p>“That I can do,” I said. I approached him and took the papers.</p>
<p>He didn’t let go of them. He opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got too many new kids,” he said.</p>
<p>“No, Gilpatrick.”</p>
<p>“My hands are full. I don’t have enough seniors to manage them all. I don’t want this to be fun or even tolerable and that requires more supervision.”</p>
<p>I let go of the paper, backing up. “No.”</p>
<p>“I won’t force you,” he said. “People connected the new heroine Fume Hood to her old persona. They’re upset. Enough that they’re hiring people to kick up a fuss, and we don’t know just who or what’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>I thought of the people who’d been in the crowd when the pillar had been hit. I could picture it.</p>
<p>“Just that they’re hiring people?” I asked.</p>
<p>“From one of the more distant settlements. Police know and are taking precautions, hero teams have been notified, but it’s messy.”</p>
<p>“Messy how?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Jurisdictions. Our apple heroine is on a new team, announcing themselves in a new jurisdiction…”</p>
<p>“…It makes them look bad if they accept outside help or have other teams elbowing in on their big first day.”</p>
<p>“Something like that,” he said. “Apple girl is getting a lot of serious hate thrown her way online. If you can tell us anything about how she might react to this situation, or anything else, that’d help.”</p>
<p>“That I can do.”</p>
<p>He went on, “And if you could captain a squad of some new guys I’ve got from another school, let me know if they’re decent and trustworthy, and just do a bit of standing guard, giving advice and information to the officers at the scene, it would be a massive help.”</p>
<p>I gave Gilpatrick my best angry glare, hands on my hips.</p>
<p>“I won’t force you,” he said. “Superiors are pressuring me to handle this. If you say no then I’ll figure something else out.”</p>
<p>“You know I’m taking it easy with all this stuff. I told you on day one I wouldn’t be one of your patrolers. I’m only here to dispense some advice.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not frontline. I can’t be frontline.”</p>
<p>“You’re a natural leader,” he said.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“I really didn’t want to use Jasper. He was joking about my speech, so I’m going to make him deliver it to the recruits,” he said.</p>
<p>I smiled, despite myself. That would be partially my fault, for reminding Jasper.</p>
<p>“Can you do the briefing, at least?” Gilpatrick asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I dropped my hands from my hips. “She really called herself Fume Hood?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Gilpatrick said. “I don’t take many of the names seriously. This doesn’t seem much worse.”</p>
<p>“It’s really terrible,” I said. “A heroine calling herself a hood? As in a gangster?”</p>
<p>“I think she has an actual hood as part of her costume.”</p>
<p>“I really hope so,” I said. I sighed and looked at my shelves. “Give me a second to review files? I’ll be right downstairs.”</p>
<p>“Just one second,” he said. “I’m going to have Jasper start with the recruits. Try to be done before I send them scurrying off.”</p>
<p>I checked the papers. Forum transcripts, some intercepted emails, some notes on Fume Hood.</p>
<p>I had a folder on my shelf. Notes from home. She was from Boston, among other places. Itinerant.</p>
<p>There were a lot of newspaper articles. She’d drawn a lot of attention once. Everyone was supposed to be getting a second chance, and it seemed that people’s memories were long enough that she wasn’t necessarily getting hers.</p>
<p>I gathered everything together, and I headed downstairs.</p>
<p>Jasper was in front of an assembly of roughly a hundred kids. Boys and girls. Not all were ninth graders, new to high school. Some would be refugees, their educations interrupted by the rather massive inconvenience of the world ending.</p>
<p>“…mostly long treks into the middle of nowhere to deliver supplies or check on things. If we’re lucky, we get a car. It’s not glamorous. Seriously. Run away,” he was saying. He spotted me coming down the stairs, and a smile crossed his face. “Once you’ve been with us for two years, you get one of these embarrassments and you have to be seen in public with them&mdash;”</p>
<p>He held up a gun with slide back and magazine removed, a bright red bike lock threaded through the bottom of the gun and out the top.</p>
<p>Jasper went on, “And you’ll be expected to clean it as well as the gun you use on the range. You’ll have to treat it like a real, loaded gun. That means you pretend it’s loaded, you don’t aim it at anything or anyone you wouldn’t want to destroy, you never leave it unattended, and so on. We’ll drill it into your skull and frankly, we’re really hoping you make a mistake so we can kick you to the curb.”</p>
<p>The other senior students were dressed in their uniforms now. Black clothes with some body armor worn over them, and the body armor was recognizable. In places, flakes of the letters and symbols that had once been stenciled onto the armor panels in white were still visible, having survived the steel wool and turpentine scrub. PRT issue, salvaged.</p>
<p>When they’d been trying to figure out what to do with the high school kids when there weren’t enough schools and seats for all of them, some idiot in the administration had come up with <i>this</i>. Some teenagers could go help on farms, some could get trained in construction, some would work, the ones who could keep their grades up enough could take afternoon classes too, and so on. There were sports teams and clubs. Finally, there was the patrol group. Us.</p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t fair to blame it on an idiot in charge. Maybe it was inevitable. Some wanted to feel like they had power, when the capes had dropped the ball. Some wanted answers. We talked and ran errands pertaining to power stuff. Some of the kids might go on to police, investigate, or study the power stuff, as more informed police officers. Possibly.</p>
<p>This was the thirty percent I didn’t like. The question mark. The places this <i>could</i> lead, theoretically. Places we were already starting to edge toward, slowly but surely.</p>
<p>“Less than five pounds of gun, if you even have a gun,” Jasper said, holding up the gun with the bike lock threaded through it. He caught my eye as he said it and he had a gleam in his eye. “Fifteen pounds of armor. It’ll be twenty-five pounds of armor if you’re with us for the long haul. These backpacks? They’re heavy. They’re miserable. Twenty-five pounds strapped to you. Food, water, first aid, tools.”</p>
<p>He holstered his gun and lifted up the bag with two hands, grunting a bit.</p>
<p>“Pay attention to those ratios. Twenty-five pounds of stuff to support and help…”</p>
<p>He dropped the bag and gave it a pat.</p>
<p>“…A good bit of protection…”</p>
<p>He rapped knuckles against the armor he wore on his chest.</p>
<p>“…And <i>possibly</i> a bit of offense.”</p>
<p>He tapped the gun where it was in its holster, the bike lock draped down and resting against his leg</p>
<p>Gilpatrick stepped up beside Jasper. “Good.”</p>
<p>“Thank you sir.”</p>
<p>“Students, if you’ll turn around to see the young lady on the stairs…”</p>
<p>The students did.</p>
<p>“…She’s our resident cape expert. If you’re sticking with us here in patrol block, if her door is open, you can go ask her questions. She knows her stuff. If you’re <i>not</i> sticking with us and her door is open, you can go ask her questions and we’ll let you cut to the head of the line. You’ll find her office upstairs and to the left.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t heard that part before. Priority to people who weren’t part of the club. I smiled.</p>
<p>We had more kids than we wanted or could use, even though we didn’t pay any wages until they’d been with us at least a year, and we did everything we could to keep them miserable. Powers were compelling. Too many had reasons for wanting to be here.</p>
<p>An unfortunate share of the students were here because they were angry. Because the patrol block had been started up by some ex-PRT folk and Gilpatrick’s speech aside, a lot of people looked at the armor, looked at the guns, looked at how we touched on the power stuff and the portals, and connected the dots.</p>
<p>“You want to go brief my seniors?” he asked me, from the far end of the room, over the heads of hundreds of new students.</p>
<p>I gave him a mock salute, then finished descending the stairs, joining the seniors while he resumed outlining things for the new kids. I motioned to the door, indicating for the group to follow.</p>
<p>A few of them were new, Gilpatrick had said. I didn’t like how angry or naturally resentful some of them looked. Cami was among them.</p>
<p>“New team is having its grand unveiling at one of the community centers,” I said. “One member is Fume Hood. She was a B-list villain, once upon a time. She’s what we term itinerant. Wandered from city to city, looking for opportunities or teams to join. Petty robbery, grand larceny, mischief, vandalism, criminal mercenary work. A lot of the time she was one of the low-rate hangers-on in a group that a bigger villain would hire to pull a bigger job. You could even call her a professional distraction. She started when she was sixteen, stopped at twenty-four or so. She’d be twenty-nine now.”</p>
<p>They were listening intently, even the new guys. That was good.</p>
<p>“As a villain, she went by Bad Apple, Poison Apple, Pomme De Sang, probably called herself Applesauce, I don’t even know. I guess she wanted to corner the market on apple-related names so nobody would have something similar. She spent a lot of time palling around with a biotinker called Blasto. She kept going back to him to pair up. Might have been boyfriend-girlfriend, even. That ended when the Slaughterhouse Nine passed through Boston. We don’t know what happened to Blasto, but we can guess it wasn’t good. Poison Apple got a little reckless after that, even though she hadn’t met up with him in over a year at that point.”</p>
<p>I opened my folder and found one of the articles. I laid it against the front of the folder and held it out so they could read it.</p>
<p>“She pulled together a group of some old teammates and new teenage villains and pulled a shopping spree, hit a mall and took what they wanted. Heroes showed up, they ran.”</p>
<p>“Miscarriage,” one of the new people in the group said, reading from the article.</p>
<p>“Poison Apple makes globes in her hands. One of the tricks she can pull with them is send them flying off in straight lines. They explode on contact with hard surfaces, just enough oomph to knock you to the ground, and they create clouds of gas or splashes of liquid poison. Usually enough to make you nauseous, a little bit feeble, more if you touch the poison in its liquid form. Nonlethal and mostly nonviolent, most of the time. Except this time, a pregnant lady was caught in the gas, or in the explosion. She lost her baby, and it became a thing in the media. Poison Apple turned herself in, partially because of the backlash she’d generated. She was serving time for pled down charges of assault and battery when Gold Morning came around,” I said.</p>
<p>A couple of the angry faces in the group looked a little angrier.</p>
<p>“She did her time,” I said. “She made a mistake, she paid for it as much as she was able. We don’t have enough good jails and so she’s free, and it looks like she’s trying to do good. That’s pretty decent, really. She’s not the enemy here.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t she?” someone asked. Their name might have been James. They’d been around last year.</p>
<p>“The threat is the people targeting her. They’ve recruited help. We don’t know how much, but the intel Gilpatrick gave me said money changed hands. You guys know the basics when it comes to capes, you can inform the cops if something comes up, you know her story, and you’ll be a few more people in uniform keeping the peace and giving protesters a little more reason to hang back. If it gets bad, any real danger, you back off.”</p>
<p>There were a few nods.</p>
<p>There were also a few looks on a handful of faces that made me concerned. Too heated, or too cold. They weren’t the majority, but I wasn’t sure the majority was on Fume Hood’s side, either.</p>
<p>It put me in mind of the crowd and the broken pillar. If it was just this, I might have been able to let it lie. I could have accepted that the students here were among the angriest and most invested in the grittier side of the cape stuff. That it was just <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Except it wasn’t. The old man, the girl who couldn’t drive, the crowd there and the response to the visiting cape… there was so much emotion bound up in things, I couldn’t trust that this was an isolated thing.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stand by and let this be the new normal, without any opposing voices. Even if my voice was a badly biased one.</p>
<p>With the climate, both general and even the fact that it was hot and tempers would be short, it would be so easy for us to see another Vikare.</p>
<p>I glanced over my shoulder and through the door. I saw Gilpatrick with Jasper and the kids.</p>
<p><em>Damn it, Gilpatrick.</em></p>
<p>“I’ll come with you,” I decided. “We’ll do our part to keep people organized and keep the peace.”</p>
<p>What did it say about the state of things, if <em>I</em> was increasingly the voice of restraint and reason?</p>
<p>I turned my attention back to the squad.</p>
<p>“For those of you who’ve just joined us, my name is Victoria Dallon, and I’ll be your squad captain today.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap11">Daybreak &mdash; 1.2</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>I had badly neglected my locker. I had an office, so my locker in the changing room was more for the things I didn’t use much at all.</p>
<p>Bag. The backpack was light, but it only had the nonperishables in it. I’d done a few patrols for Gilpatrick over the winter, visiting some of the settlements that were a little further afield, while many of the students were taking Christmas off. I’d also used it for my fitness test.</p>
<p>I set it on the table in the center of the room. Something to weigh when I was done getting outfitted. For now, I just needed it out of my locker. The bag took up the bottom half, the armor took up the upper half.</p>
<p>Outfit change. I couldn’t go out in a skirt and body armor. I had <em>some</em> self respect. The pants in my locker were part of an emergency change of clothes, heavier fabric intended for winter and trips to Bet when the weather was bad.</p>
<p>I hadn’t put the pants through the wash since having to shovel snow over the winter, but I hadn’t worn them much either. There was still salt crusting the heels, white against black fabric. I walked over to the sink and rinsed the worst of the salt off, then rolled up the cuffs a bit so I wouldn’t have wet pants slapping against my ankle.</p>
<p>I kicked off my shoes and hiked up the pants so they were under my skirt, then unfastened the skirt.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Gilpatrick said, behind me, a deep male voice in the girl’s change room. I jumped a little. “Are you free to talk?”</p>
<p>I turned my head. There wasn’t a door to the girl’s changing room, but there was a solid wall blocking the view. I could see the edge of Gilpatrick’s arm &mdash; he stood with his back to the wall and the changing room.</p>
<p>Camisola was in the room too, unpacking and repacking her kits for her bag. She met my eyes.</p>
<p>“I’ll step out,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Cami,” Gilpatrick said. I pulled my shoes back on and laced them as Cami left the room.</p>
<p>Belt. Holster. I threaded the belt through my belt loops, careful to position the holster.</p>
<p>Cami was apparently out of earshot, because Gil spoke again. “Thank you, Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Give me Jasper,” I said. “For my squad.”</p>
<p>“Jasper?” he asked. “Why?”</p>
<p>Well, that said a lot, didn’t it?</p>
<p>“Because I’m paranoid,” I said. Paranoid on more than one front, but I wouldn’t tell Gilpatrick that. I had suspicions and his willingness to give me Jasper would tell me things. “Is anyone else standing outside the door?”</p>
<p>“This conversation is just you and me.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I know Jasper, and I’m honestly more worried about the attitudes of the people you gave me than I am about the protest or whatever it is people are going to pull with Bad Apple.”</p>
<p>“Jasper’s attitude isn’t great.”</p>
<p>“Jasper is a joker and he can be immature, but he can give that five pounds of gun speech because he believes it. He’s in this because he thinks capes are cool, not because he’s pissed. Give me one person I know will agree with me.”</p>
<p>“I kind of need every senior I can get. But I’ll give you that.”</p>
<p>I bit my lip, thinking as I worked the combination of the safe at the topmost section of my locker. I pulled out the pistol and holstered it. I kept my hand there, reminding myself of the weapon’s weight as I tried to figure out how to word my question, and if I wanted to ask it.</p>
<p>“Then how about you take some of the angry ones? The new guys you were giving me.”</p>
<p>“That was a quick assessment.”</p>
<p>I gathered the pistol magazines and slotted them into the pouch, before setting to attaching the pouch to my leg and belt. “I don’t want them. I don’t want to get some people from elsewhere with their own habits and ways of doing things, and have to train them on top of doing this thing.”</p>
<p>“Take them, Victoria,” Gilpatrick said. “They came with good recommendations, they know their stuff, and if it does wind up being a protest, you’ll want the extra bodies. If it doesn’t, then it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“Things are never that simple, Gil,” I said.</p>
<p>“Take them,” he said, firm.</p>
<p>“You owe me for this,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know,” he said.</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>Armor. I pulled my vest from the bottom of the locker. I saved it for last because once it was on, I wouldn’t be able to bend down or move as easily. The old name and number was still visible by the impression that had been made in the armor when it had been punched in and painted on. The steel-wool scrubbing I’d given it hadn’t erased the whole impression.</p>
<p>I didn’t know who Cameron was or where they’d ended up, but I wore their armor now. I tucked the papers in between my chest and the armor, where the straps would help keep them in place.</p>
<p>I spoke, “It’s a cushy job, I get to geek out and show off, and I like my office and the access I get to the portal, I don’t want to take that for granted, but you owe me a few already. This is one more.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said. “I’ll make it up to you. I’ve got to run. Kids to torture. I’ll send Jasper your way.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. “Do I need my full pack?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “No, I wouldn’t do that to you. Full pack is a torment I reserve for the newbies.”</p>
<p>I was glad to put my bag back in the locker. I heard Gilpatrick walking away, raising his voice to shout orders.</p>
<p>I used fingernails to comb my hair back, then began braiding it. I had to look in the mirror to make sure I’d gotten all of the stray strands.</p>
<p><em>Hi me,</em> I thought, as I made eye contact.</p>
<p>How to describe that feeling? Something resembling relief and a sinking feeling at the same time. It was a small feeling but still one that I would carry with me for the rest of the day. That day would be a little bit worse because of the moment, but it would feel more stable for the reminder, too.</p>
<p>I had a good two years of experience to draw from, in figuring that out.</p>
<p>I’d stopped braiding my hair, I realized, and I’d started holding my breath without realizing it. I exhaled, closed the safe, spun the dial, closed the locker, and walked out onto the floor of the building, resuming the braiding of my hair.</p>
<p>Forward. Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth. Moving on with the day.</p>
<p>I caught up with Jasper as he joined the group.</p>
<p>“I’m driving, apparently,” Jasper said, wangling the keys in front of me. “And keeping you company. Gilpatrick explained the situation.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. I pointed in the direction of the bus. We started walking.</p>
<p>“You’re friends?” one of the new guys asked.</p>
<p>Still braiding, I looked over at Jasper. “Enhh.”</p>
<p>“You can tell she’s really diplomatic,” Jasper said.</p>
<p>“Work friends, kind of?” I said.</p>
<p>“We don’t hang out,” Jasper said. “I’m not sure what we’d do if we did. We don’t have anything in common.”</p>
<p>“We got stuck together for jobs and errands enough times we became familiar with each other,” I said. “We get on okay. Jasper’s cool. Just don’t ask him about the tattoo.”</p>
<p>“Tattoo?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll explain when we’re driving,” Jasper said, smiling.</p>
<p>We reached the bus. It wasn’t pretty. A half-size school bus, rust had been mostly scrubbed away and it had received a paint job in black with white sides. The emergency exit at the back had been redone so it was the main way in and out, and a passenger seat had been added at the front. There was an area for supplies and bags to be stowed between the wheels at the right side.</p>
<p>I wrapped my braid around itself a few times, and tied it there in a slightly messy bun-coil, then climbed up to the passenger seat. The seniors climbed into the back. There were a few faces I recognized but couldn’t name, a dozen more that I didn’t recognize and definitely couldn’t name. I could tell that they were from elsewhere by the fact that the armor they’d brought with them had been painted black, rather than have the white letters scrubbed away. Twenty-four in all.</p>
<p>Jasper took the driver’s seat, starting up the bus immediately.</p>
<p>Even parked in the shade, even in September, the heat was such that the seats were uncomfortably hot. I’d thought about removing my armor once my hands were free, and carrying it by hand, but I decided to keep it on for the extra buffer.</p>
<p>Didn’t do anything to spare my ass from the warm faux-leather seat. I didn’t like being aware of my body to that extent.</p>
<p>“Where to?” Jasper asked, rescuing me from my thoughts.</p>
<p>“Norwalk-Fairfield span,” I said.</p>
<p>“Rural, isn’t that?” Jasper asked.</p>
<p>“Last I heard.”</p>
<p>Jasper had to almost stand up to get the perspective to see through the open back of the bus. He reversed out of the lot and took us onto the road.</p>
<p>“Maybe you guys can answer. What’s the deal with stretches and spans?” one of the new guys asked.</p>
<p>I turned sideways in my seat, looking back. Now that I was sitting and looking back at them, they were older, I noted. Seventeen at a minimum. “You guys are from one of the denser parts of the city?”</p>
<p>“New York Central. Near the Bet-Gimel portal,” a girl said.</p>
<p>One of the two big ones, then. We’d bled into the areas surrounding the portals. Brockton Bay had been the first, but we’d had a few in a few major cities and New York was a big one. The cluster of settlements around the portals in the northeastern US and people’s desire to have ready access to that cluster and the resources, community, information and security it afforded had played a big part in the megalopolis forming.</p>
<p>One blob around New York, one blob around the New Brockton settlement, clusters south of New Brockton, near what would or should be Boston, and everything had spread out or extended from there, mostly hugging the coast and connecting to one another.</p>
<p>I explained, “We’ve got these long narrow bands of mingled city and agriculture connecting the primary settlement points, to the point it’s hard to say where one thing starts and the other ends. And instead of building five big houses they’d rather build an apartment building that hosts twenty, which makes things fuzzy with the distinctions of urban and rural. So we get the ever-expanding megalopolis blob and we can’t figure out what to call it, even though it’s already this monster.”</p>
<p>Our progress out of the city center was slow. Construction. Endless construction. Jasper seemed happy to be driving, even at a crawl.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the first guy spoke.</p>
<p>“In terms of the bands that rope everything in together, we go by the cities and locations that were there beforehand. If you look at where Norwalk would be on a map, that’s the name for the region we’re heading to. If it’s east-west it’s a span. If it’s north-south it’s a stretch. But it’s all a part of the city.”</p>
<p>“What if it’s both?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“Then it’s neither,” Jasper said. “You just give it a name.”</p>
<p>“More accurately, you try to give it a name and end up in a heated, months-long debate about what to call the area, with way too many emotions tied up into things,” I said.</p>
<p>The guy from right behind me said, “I don’t see why we can’t just give the individual areas names like they used to have. If it’s close to Norwalk, then we call it fucking Norwalk.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” I said. I gave a stern look to the guy who’d said it. “Swearing’s fine, but not if you’re getting heated. We’re chatting, not getting up in arms.”</p>
<p>“Right. Sorry,” the guy said. He didn’t look particularly sorry.</p>
<p>We picked up speed as we pulled onto a street with less construction. With the back of the bus open and the windows on either side of Jasper and me rolled all the way down, the wind whipped through the bus. The city smelled like dust, drywall, and hot pavement.</p>
<p>I dangled one arm out the window, moving my fingers and feeling the air moving against them.</p>
<p>“It gets complicated,” I said. “Geography’s slightly different, they’re hardly checking longitude and latitude exactly when we settle in one place or another. They’re doing what the surroundings allow. Means the Norwalk we’re going to might actually be between two places, or off to one side.”</p>
<p>Jasper chimed in, “I always remember the Norwalk-Fairfield span because it’s close to the portal for Earth N. N for Norwalk.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I guess that works.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a question for you, though,” he said.</p>
<p>“You want to talk about your tattoo idea.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “Do what you want.”</p>
<p>He turned his head so he could talk to the back of the bus while watching the road. “We’re doing the squad thing, right? And a lot of us are doing this with the idea we’ll police the capes, or help them out.”</p>
<p>“Police them, mostly,” a guy said.</p>
<p>“Opinions vary,” Jasper said, “But I don’t want to get sidetracked. What I’m thinking is, what’s better than a good callsign? We have nicknames to call each other. The trouble is getting a good one to stick.”</p>
<p>“Opinions on what a good callsign is are going to vary,” I said.</p>
<p>“Quiet you,” Jasper said. “You and I have talked about this and I’ve determined you have no idea what you’re talking about when it comes to this. You know the cape stuff, sure, but you clearly don’t get this.”</p>
<p>“You want to decide your own callsign?” the girl from the back asked.</p>
<p>“Jester,” Jasper said. “And I swear, if people don’t start using it, I’m going to make it happen by getting a tattoo of a jester and ‘fool’ written beneath it, right on my bicep.”</p>
<p>The protests, naturally, started rolling in from the rest of the bus. He couldn’t decide his own callsign, why would he have it say fool if he wanted the callsign to be Jester, why even have it be Jester?</p>
<p>I tuned it out, sticking my head out the window. Jasper tried to sell the rest of the bus on his idea and was very thoroughly shot down. In this, at least, all was right with the world. It was a bad idea. Forty year-old Jasper didn’t need to live with the mistakes of seventeen year-old Jasper.</p>
<p>We drove past skyscrapers paneled in gold-tinted glass. Solar glass, it was supposed to be called. We drove past parks with the same rough-edged slice of nature that touched the schoolyard back at the high school. We drove past a lot of construction, and we were lucky that it didn’t slow us down much.</p>
<p>“Victoria Dallon.”</p>
<p>I’d heard my name. I was broken from my reverie. How long had we been driving now? The city was seemingly unending and I didn’t recognize the landmarks enough to nail anything down.</p>
<p><em>Victoria Dallon.</em> I looked at myself in the bus’ side view mirror.</p>
<p>“What was that?” Jasper asked, while I remained silent.</p>
<p>“Name sounds familiar,” the voice said, from the back. It sounded almost smug, knowing. “Can’t quite place it.”</p>
<p>“That so?” Jasper asked. “Maybe keep it to yourself, then.”</p>
<p>“Is that how this is?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s how everything is,” Jasper said. “Not just this. When you’re bringing up the past, whoever you’re talking to, there are two likely possibilities. First, it’s good, and we miss the shit out of it, or, second, it’s bad and why would you bring up the bad except to be a tool?”</p>
<p>“It could be important,” the guy said. “It’s good to know who or what we’re dealing with.”</p>
<p>“Could be,” Jasper said. “But I can tell you this. Gil trusts her. I trust her. If you want to know who you’re dealing with, why don’t you start by taking our cue?”</p>
<p>There was no response from the back.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, if you’re not going to listen to us,” Jasper said, “why are you on our bus?”</p>
<p>Again, no response.</p>
<p>Then, belated, one of the others uttered a quiet, “Leave it.”</p>
<p>Not aimed at Jasper. My detractor had been about to say something, I took it, and he’d been told to be quiet. Not the best result, but it seemed to end the line of questioning.</p>
<p>I wondered if there was something nice I could do for Jasper, for sparing me having to handle that.</p>
<p>I fished the papers out from my vest, smoothing them against my lap. I glanced out the window. The city had thinned out, and I could see farms and tent cities further out.</p>
<p>We had to be pretty close to our destination now.</p>
<p>I twisted around in my seat again, looking at the people in the back. I could tell by the way one of them held himself, shoulders square, eye contact forced, that he’d been the one to speak out against me. He studied me like he would an opponent.</p>
<p>I addressed them, “When we get there, we stay together. We’ll have a quick chat with the people in charge, all together. If the police have orders for us, those are the orders we follow. If not, I’ll tell you guys to get to work. You head to the crowd, and you say hi.”</p>
<p>“Say hi?”</p>
<p>“Mingle. Show your faces, let people know we’re around. Ask how they’re doing. What do they think? Look for anyone antsy, especially anyone antsy that we’re there. Don’t engage if there’s trouble. Let the police know and let me know, and we’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>“I like looping through the crowds,” Jasper said. “We did that once or twice, when Gilpatrick was calling the shots, last year. People don’t see the face or the hair, only the uniform. If you loop back, it looks like there are more of us than there are.”</p>
<p>“Give them second thoughts?” the girl from the back asked.</p>
<p>“Something like that,” Jasper said.</p>
<p>I wrapped up. “When we get settled and things are going to start, we’ll be keeping eyes out or standing guard, probably. We regroup before then, we’ll figure out what’s up, and see where we’re needed.”</p>
<p>I saw people nod, then turned around in my seat.</p>
<p>“Which street?” Jasper asked.</p>
<p>“Myrtle.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s it down there,” he said.</p>
<p>There were still a lot of tents and cubicle houses hereabouts, it seemed. On the southern side of the main road, to our left, we had apartment buildings, stores, and something that looked like a brand spanking new swathe of city. On the other side, it was more construction, tents, farm, and the houses that weren’t real houses&mdash; more like mock houses made of panels that had been bolted together, like overlarge tents with hard exteriors.</p>
<p>We turned away from the main road, into the deeper section of the city. The community center was made of stone, had a squat clock tower situated on top, and looked stately, even with the tall buildings surrounding it, many at least as tall as the community center was. A patch of park with a fountain sat squarely in front of it.</p>
<p>School was just getting out, it seemed. Students were streaming through the area. They walked through and along the road to the point that we couldn’t get very close. Many heads turned our way, curious.</p>
<p>Jasper found a parking space a block away from the center, and parked there. Our people climbed out the back while Jasper and I got organized at the front.</p>
<p>“Jasper,” I said.</p>
<p>“Special orders for me?”</p>
<p>“When and if the rest of them are going through the crowd, stay near the front door. If anyone gets nervous and ducks out, it might be something.”</p>
<p>“Should I follow?”</p>
<p>“Probably not. Keep an eye out, let me know if anything happens.”</p>
<p>“And why is this a secret from the others?”</p>
<p>Because I didn’t trust the others. They’d been foisted on me, they had clear attitudes, and I was worried that if push came to shove, they might let a troublemaker go if it meant fucking with the capes.</p>
<p>“Paranoia,” I said. I started to climb out of my seat. “Thanks for the backup back there. Jester.”</p>
<p>Jasper grinned as my face fell.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but it sounds bad,” I said. “I can’t make this a thing.”</p>
<p>“It sounds bad when you’re saying it as if someone’s pulling your fingernails out while you’re talking.”</p>
<p>“They might as well be,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s good,” he said. “It’s cool.”</p>
<p>“It’s against everything I stand for,” I said. I climbed down from my seat.</p>
<p>“It’s great,” Jasper said, from the other side of the bus. He tossed the keys into the air and caught them.</p>
<p>Some of the others were pulling on the armor they’d left off while sitting on the bus. Once we were set, we moved as a group toward the town hall.</p>
<p>The fact that the community center was actually in the center of this neighborhood meant that the foot traffic was heavy. A lot of it was moving around the crowd that had formed. A lot of people with signs, but a lot of young and eager eyes. Kids aged ten to seventeen, all fresh from their first day of school, genuinely interested in their fledgling hero team.</p>
<p>No police parked outside, at a glance. No barricades, either.</p>
<p>Inside, it was standing room only. Cheap plastic chairs were arranged in rows and columns, and there were many places where parent and young child shared chairs.</p>
<p>I saw some people up at the front perk up at our appearance, and the crowd parted to let us through.</p>
<p>I identified a woman with gray and black hair and a gray suit-dress that the other people up at the front seemed to be standing around. I approached her.</p>
<p>“You’re in charge?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m the closest thing to someone in charge. District representative,” she said. “We don’t have a group like yours here. You’re all so <em>young</em>.”</p>
<p>I kept still, not letting my emotions show. I felt the sinking feeling again, without the relief, and without the steadiness that I got from seeing myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>Not a big thing. It was like treading water and a hand on my forehead pushing me down, before pulling away. Surfacing again, finding my equilibrium, realizing how tired I was as I resumed treading water.</p>
<p>I was very aware of the eyes on us.</p>
<p>“Do you have more outside?” the representative asked.</p>
<p>“More… of us?” I asked, finding my composure again.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“No. No we don’t have more outside.”</p>
<p>She looked <em>spooked</em>. More spooked after my ‘no’.</p>
<p>“I can’t help but notice that you have no police presence at all,” I said.</p>
<p>“We have some, but not many. It’s the way it is in Norfair span.”</p>
<p>“Norfair,” I said, noting the coined name. “It’s not really a presence, is it?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “We didn’t expect this many naysayers. With this many, they had to have come from outside the community.”</p>
<p>The crowd in the room with us looked eager and happy enough. A few frowns, but rare. Had it been just this, overlapping conversations, anticipation, bright eyes and parents with kids, maybe a few people ready to raise some pointed questions if given the opportunity, then all would have been well.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just them. The protesters outside were audible, even with stone walls between us and them. Two angry voices outside, for every one quiet, polite person inside.</p>
<p>I didn’t like how much this was stacking up against us. The police not having much presence, the controversy, the number of protesters.</p>
<p>Paranoia again, that I couldn’t help but wonder about the recruits I’d been given. Forced to take, as it had turned out.</p>
<p>Too many things together.</p>
<p>“I think we should talk to the capes,” I said.</p>
<p>“Please,” the district rep said.</p>
<p>She led us into the back room, just behind where the de-facto stage was. The team of heroes was there, anxious, waiting to be announced and to step out in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>Four of them. Their costumes were close to being clothing, but had just enough stylization to make them something more. The masks and face-coverings helped to make them more cape-like.</p>
<p>Fume Hood did have a hood, as part of a green hooded coat she wore. Fans were built into the coat, only partially disguised, each of them much like the ones that were built into the back of a computer, and they made her coat, hair, and hood flap.</p>
<p>There was a man in a deep purple tank top and skinny pants with glass jutting from his skin at the elbows and hands, his upper face only a craggy mass of glass or jewel-like shards sticking out of flesh, just beautiful enough to not be macabre.</p>
<p>A man about my age slouched in a chair, looking dejected. He had something that looked like small shields over the back of each hand, three large scimitar-like blades jutting from the back of each shield like they were oversize claws. He wore a top that showed his muscular stomach, with shorts that reached his knees. A two-part icon was displayed on chest and belt buckle.</p>
<p>The last was a woman in overalls, muscular, with hair shorter than most of the boys in my troupe, something that looked like thick paint slashed across her eyes and nose, and covering her arms up to the elbows. The paint was black at the very edges, where it was thinner, but pure white elsewhere. Her eyes were black from corner to corner.</p>
<p>“Great,” the woman with the paint said, sarcastic. “Just what we needed.”</p>
<p>“We’re here to help,” I said.</p>
<p>“We might need it,” Fume Hood said.</p>
<p>“Do you know who’s after you?” I asked. “Or what’s going on?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“I might be being paranoid, but this feels off,” I said.</p>
<p>“A lot of little things,” Fume Hood said. “Crystalclear’s getting a bad vibe.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I looked at the man with the glass chunks where his nose, eyes, brow and scalp should be.</p>
<p>“Have you considered canceling the event?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We were actively debating it before you came in,” the man in purple said. “We’re split.”</p>
<p>“Can we break the tie?” I asked.</p>
<p>They exchanged glances.</p>
<p>The painted woman scowled, “You can.”</p>
<p>The man with the claws stood abruptly, shoving his chair to the ground in the process, before stalking off.</p>
<p>“Okay,” the painted woman said, again. She looked at the district rep. “We’re sorry. Can you have them disperse? Tell the protesters they win.”</p>
<p>The rep nodded, hurrying from the room to where the people were seated.</p>
<p>“Death knell for our group,” the painted woman said.</p>
<p>“Maybe. Probably,” Fume said. She looked at Crystalclear. “Feeling better?”</p>
<p>“No,” he said.</p>
<p>Fume nodded at that.</p>
<p>“Would you stick around?” Crystalclear addressed us. “I wouldn’t mind the backup, if you’re here to help, and I have the sense this is going to get worse before it gets better.”</p>
<p>“Gut feeling sense or… power sense?” I asked.</p>
<p>I could hear the commotion as people started to leave. I could hear the complaining. Even before he answered, my gut feeling sense was that he wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>“The latter,” Crystalclear said, corroborating.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap12">Daybreak &mdash; 1.3</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>This was the point in time that I would have liked to be able to take to the skies. Information was important, and if I didn’t have surveillance cameras, I would have been pretty content with a bird’s eye view of the scene.</p>
<p>I clenched one fist, cracking my knuckles, before wrapping my other hand around it, cracking them again for good measure.</p>
<p>I turned to look at the people from the patrol. “Set up around the building. Watch what’s going on outside, stay in touch, report anything unusual. Jasper? Hang back.”</p>
<p>The others turned to go, some looking back at the capes one last time before leaving. Interest, other things.</p>
<p>“Can’t hurt,” the painted lady said.</p>
<p>“I’m Victoria,” I said. “That’s Jasper. I know Fume Hood from the notes we got, and I caught Crystalclear’s name.”</p>
<p>“Longscratch is the one who just left,” the painted lady said. “I’m Tempera.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” I said. “Good to meet you. Crystalclear, can you fill me in on your power? What are you getting?”</p>
<p>“I see through everything,” Crystalclear said, tapping the chunk of crystal that stood out from the lower edge of his eye socket. “As if everything was crystal. I’ve learned there’s a lot of nuance to it. A little bit of seeing into the past, a little bit of seeing into the future, a little bit of a sense of people’s focus.”</p>
<p>“He has a blaster power too,” Tempera said. “Goes through walls and the ground. Synergy.”</p>
<p>“I really hope it doesn’t come to actually using that. Right now, I’m more interested in how this points to possible trouble in the future,” I said.</p>
<p>“Uh,” Crystalclear said. He looked around. “It’s hard to explain because it’s not a sense anyone else has. Say I was looking at a wall. It looks like a chunk of clear glass and the light catches at the edges and corners and they’re highlighted.”</p>
<p>My eye roved over the room. It was reminiscent of a teacher’s lounge, but it had less of an emphasis on the lounging. Coffee cups sat on windowsills and there were places where furniture had been stacked once, and the furniture had been moved out into the open room at the front of the building, where all the people were or had been seated. Glass cases with model buildings had been brought inside and carefully stacked against the wall. A long table that might have served as a conference table was folded up in one corner.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine it like Crystalclear was describing it. A sketch in three dimensions, only the lines visible. “I follow you so far.”</p>
<p>“The edges of walls and floor are usually clear, crisp, and closer to white. Solid objects don’t change, so there’s no reason for that to change. It’s blurred. Blue tinted.”</p>
<p>“Future sight,” Tempera added. “Past-sight is red, future-sight is blue. Like the doppler.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear went on, “In the future, that wall vibrates. Similar effect with people, but they move around more. I see you all as streaks, shifting around, white-edged where you’re resting in present. There is refraction and some fractures around people’s heads, representing focus and kind of thinking.”</p>
<p>“That gets blueshifted redshifted?” I asked. “It’s not displayed as color?”</p>
<p>Crystalclear nodded his head. It was a motion made more weighty by the heavy growth at the top of his head. “Not as color. It’s… edges to the light around them, sharpness and softness, distortions like how you can look at a glass of water with a straw in it and the straw isn’t straight, or you see multiple straws. The worst breaks in focus look like grooves or outright breaks. A lot of people here are going to be distorted soon. Or were. They’re leaving and they’re clearing up.”</p>
<p>His head turned as he focused on things on the other sides of the walls.</p>
<p>“What about, say, Jasper?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Jasper said. “Use yourself as an example.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear looked at Jasper. “Hard to say. Whatever it is, it’s small or it’s distant.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear glanced over at Tempetera and Fume Hood. “Not just him either. It doesn’t give me much to work with.”</p>
<p>He turned his attention to me.</p>
<p>I cut right to asking my next question, before he could comment. “Do you see the direction of it? Anything big and blue that’s suggesting a major thing coming in sometime in the future? One section of the building that gets hit harder?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I’d have to see it before I saw how things were around it, and even then there’s nuance.”</p>
<p>“You’re thinking of a parahuman or weapon?” Tempera asked.</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” I said. “If I was a civilian with an issue, and I was going after capes, I’d go big or I wouldn’t try at all. If we’re talking something that shakes this whole community center… bomb? Parahumans are definitely possible, except I’m not sure how using parahumans squares with the sentiment toward parahumans.”</p>
<p>Fume Hood spoke up from the background. “Set us against each other, they benefit either way.”</p>
<p>“Could be,” I said. I paused. “As soon as the crowd has dispersed enough, I want to get you guys clear of here. Do you have a decent mover power to use?”</p>
<p>“Longscratch does,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“Not a mass mover power, is it?” I asked. At the negation, I turned to Jasper. “Can you bring the bus close? If the crowd is thinning out, you should be able to pull right up to the door. Take someone with you, if we’re delayed, do like I discussed earlier. Keep an eye out.”</p>
<p>Jasper saluted, turning to go.</p>
<p>The bus wasn’t elegant, but hopefully it would take us away from vulnerable civilians or areas.</p>
<p>“How is Longscratch?” Tempera asked Crystalclear.</p>
<p>“He’s fine. Stalked off. He’s keeping an eye out for trouble,” Crystalclear said. He pointed up and off to one side. On an upper floor, it seemed, or on the roof.</p>
<p>“That’s how he is. I won’t bother him. I’ll go talk to the district representative, instead, if that’s alright,” Tempera said, looking my way.</p>
<p>“If the coast is clear,” I said.</p>
<p>“Most people have cleared out of the main hall,” Crystalclear said. “The ones who are hanging back seem like the types to be doing it for good reason. Parents with kids, teenagers hoping to get a glimpse of the heroes they came to see.”</p>
<p>“That’s positive,” Tempera said. “I’ll give them a glimpse then. Thank you, Victoria.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to get a glass of water and get my head straight,” Fume Hood said. “I’ll catch up with the rest of you in a minute.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go running off,” Tempera said. “Get your water, take a minute, but come back after. I don’t want you to throw yourselves to the wolves.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” Fume Hood said.</p>
<p>“Or whatever variant on that plan you might be thinking. I can see you trying to lead the enemy way from us,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“I <em>won’t</em>,” Fume Hood said, annoyed.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t work anyway,” Crystalclear added.</p>
<p>“Your future sight telling you that?” Fume Hood asked, her annoyance becoming something more bitter.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the future like that. You know that. But I do know that they’re mad at all of us. Our fortunes are intertwined, and their hate is&mdash; it’s not very targeted.”</p>
<p>“Not hate,” I said.</p>
<p>They looked my way.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to see it as hate, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot,” I said. “It’s not that. It’s <em>blame.</em>”</p>
<p>“Blame,” Fume Hood said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a reflection on you. Humanity is hurt. It’s hurt in a way that makes it a little bit animal. Reactive. They’re snapping at any target that presents itself, because the hurt is fresh. They’re taking that hurt and they’re looking for anyone they can put it onto. You…”</p>
<p>I trailed off.</p>
<p>“We presented ourselves,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“Not in a bad way,” I said. “This isn’t your fault.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get my water,” Fume Hood said, curt. She didn’t wait for a response, heading into the adjacent room, further from the front of the building.</p>
<p>Once Fume Hood was gone, Tempera nudged Crystalclear. “Keep an eye on them?”</p>
<p>Crystalclear nodded.</p>
<p>Tempera gave me a nod before stepping out the door.</p>
<p>“Is Fume Hood going to be okay?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Who knows?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Trouble still isn’t imminent?”</p>
<p>Crystalclear shook his head. “At least fifteen minutes off. I’m thinking we should go get a better vantage point, see if I can’t spot any troublemakers.”</p>
<p>“Watch out for my guys,” I said.</p>
<p>“Watch out for what?”</p>
<p>I glanced at the door. “Blame.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” he said. “I shouldn’t stick my neck out or draw attention to myself, then?”</p>
<p>“Not unless I’m there.”</p>
<p>“And where will you be?” he asked.</p>
<p>I looked at the other door. The one Fume Hood had taken. “I was thinking I’d get a glass of water. Unless you think that would be overstepping.”</p>
<p>He looked in the direction Fume Hood had gone. His voice was soft as he said, “I have no fucking idea.”</p>
<p>“I’ll catch up with you,” I said, clapping a hand on his shoulder in passing.</p>
<p>The area adjacent to the conference room was a kitchen, set up with multiple stovetops and long counters. Catering-focused, at a glance. The stoves were of different makes and models. Scavenged.</p>
<p>Fume Hood was standing by the sink, a glass of water in hand. She looked at me, her eyes barely visible with the surrounding mask and the overhanging hood.</p>
<p>“Can I grab some water? The bus ride was warm, even with the windows rolled down.”</p>
<p>She filled a glass, then slid it along the counter to me, so it met me halfway as I made my approach.</p>
<p>“What was the plan?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The plan?”</p>
<p>“Corporate? Sponsored? Ideology-driven? There are a lot of those nowadays. Move forward, rebuild, hold to the past, unity in strength, religion…”</p>
<p>“No ideology,” she said. “No sponsorship. No business partnerships. I’m not even sure what we would have done about the money.”</p>
<p>“That can be hard,” I said. I drank my water.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t supposed to be easy.”</p>
<p>I finished my water, then approached the sink to get more. Fume Hood turned around, leaning against the counter just beside me.</p>
<p>She said, “It was community focused. Serving the area, hometown heroes like the old days. I thought of it as community service, in more than one way.”</p>
<p>“I like that,” I said.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “I’m not sure if there’s anything to like about it.”</p>
<p>“It’s a good idea. It sounds positive. Maybe it’s worth trying again later.”</p>
<p>“It won’t come together again like this later. Tempera is pretty good at this whole thing, and she needs to do the cape stuff, so she’ll find a team to join. Crystalclear will get poached because decent thinker powers are in demand. Longscratch… I don’t know why he’s even here. Tempera suggested it to him, for some reason, he accepted for some reason. He’s upset it fell apart. Next time, he’ll just say no. He’ll steer clear so he doesn’t have reason to get upset again.”</p>
<p>“Mover psychology?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that stuff. I just know he’s a weird mix of wants and needs and he’s really cool when things are good and he’s impossible to understand when they aren’t. Which they aren’t.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be sorry if you knew,” she said. She stood taller, stretching a bit. She tossed the empty glass between her hands. “It’s my fault.”</p>
<p>“You orchestrated this?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I hurt a pregnant lady and she lost her child and I don’t even feel that bad about it,” Fume Hood said. “I turned myself in, but it was because people thought I’d become a PR problem for capes in general. I’d run out of friends and places to run to. It seemed like the only way to get things to cool down.”</p>
<p>The glass smacked against each of her hands as she tossed it back and forth.</p>
<p>I drank my water, still watching her.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>pissed</em>,” she said. “People are making such a big deal over this, and I can’t bring myself to see it their way. It was an accident. I told the civilians to sit and stay put, and this <em>stupid&mdash;</em>”</p>
<p>She stopped there, clenching her fist.</p>
<p>Fume Hood continued, “&mdash;stupid fucking woman. She ran right to where I was shooting out a display window, gets knocked on her ass, breathes in the gas.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what she was thinking,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’ve wondered that every day since. I’m mostly caught between thinking she <em>wanted</em> to get hurt and lose the baby, it was so blatant, or that she thought the broken display window was an escape route, even though there were others she could have run for,” Fume Hood said. “I was so pissed. I shouted at people to take her outside and get her some fresh air, even though I knew it made everything harder with the robbery. They’d contact authorities, we’d have to protect ourselves, whatever. I thought I was pretty fair. She got medical attention and shit.”</p>
<p>“Could have been worse,” I said.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have pulled that robbery at the mall. I know that. But it’s not one of my big regrets. Her being a stupid fucking idiot isn’t one of them either, obviously.”</p>
<p>“You turned yourself in after that.”</p>
<p>“The heat got too much, like I said. And&mdash; and I was <em>tired</em>, you know?”</p>
<p>Her voice had cracked on the ‘tired’.</p>
<p>She sounded tired <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>“It had been years, trying to get by. A lot of it was fun. The drugs, the robberies and mercenary work, the <em>adventure</em>, new places and really interesting people. Some shitty people, lots of scary people, but they were always interesting. Capes are interesting in a way you probably wouldn’t get if you didn’t know any for real.”</p>
<p>“I grew up with capes,” I said.</p>
<p>She stopped passing the glass from hand to hand, holding it in both instead. “Did you? Huh.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. My glass was empty. I put it on the counter and, finger on the inside, spun it in a circle, the bottom rattling on the metal countertop.</p>
<p>She continued, “Well, all I know is, the crime stuff started to feel like work. The drugs stopped feeling like they were a <em>plus</em> and started feeling like they were something I had to do. I was never addicted, I never <em>craved</em> it, I never had withdrawal after. This analogy I’ve been thinking of is it’s like I had to go to the bathroom every half hour and who wants to do that, you know? Who wants to keep interrupting their day for something they aren’t even enjoying anymore?”</p>
<p>“No idea,” I said. “But I can see what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“The cool people started dropping away. A couple dead, others just stopped being cool. High people are really boring to be around. So like a genius, I thought hey, let’s just go to prison. I made a deal. I wanted a bit of an education, training at some job or another, safety, I didn’t want to be stuck in there too long.”</p>
<p>“How’d it work out?”</p>
<p>“Deal worked out fine. Judge agreed, heroes agreed, it was one less parahuman on the streets that people were really upset about. Jail isn’t fun, but it was what I needed, I think.”</p>
<p>“Shows character, I think,” I said. “Realizing where you were at, where you were headed, and changing course.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have character,” Fume Hood said. “It was selfish and self-centered. It was me, me, me, I’m bored, I’m done with the drugs, I’m scared of being caught by angry people, I want this deal, I want some education. I don’t and I never cared about that pregnant idiot.”</p>
<p>She met my eyes as she said that last bit.</p>
<p>Challenging me.</p>
<p>I spun the glass on the countertop again. “The community service hero stuff?”</p>
<p>“Me, me, me,” she said, her voice quiet. “I thought it gave me the best chance of dodging any lingering heat. Ha.”</p>
<p>I took my finger away from the glass. It spun in a circle before settling with a rattle.</p>
<p>“I don’t buy it,” I said.</p>
<p>She shrugged, tossing the glass into the air, catching it.</p>
<p>“You said before that you have real regrets,” I said. “And you can call yourself selfish, but I think the dots connect here. Your reasons, your regrets.”</p>
<p>She tossed the glass into the air, caught it.</p>
<p>She did it a few more times.</p>
<p>“We should go,” she said. “Check on the others. Do our part.”</p>
<p>“We should,” I said.</p>
<p>The water from the faucet we’d used deposited a fat droplet on the metal bottom of the large sink, producing a hollow sound. Neither of us budged.</p>
<p>“I got friends into the soft drugs and I egged them on instead of stopping them when they got themselves into the harder stuff. I regret that, I turned myself in for that, even though I was supposed to be serving the punishment for the pregnant woman. For other stuff, more on that level. I turned myself in for the” &mdash;she took a deep breath, as if to signify magnitude&mdash; “years of being a low to mid tier nusiance. For being tiresome. And because I was tired of it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a priest,” I said. “I don’t have the power to say some words and absolve you. It’s up to society to decide how angry they are and how they come to terms with it. It’s up to you to decide how willing you are to face your deeds. When it comes to me… I can say I respect a lot of what you’re saying. I definitely think you should own up more to what you did to that woman, stop calling her stupid. It’s not a point in your favor.”</p>
<p>Fume Hood nodded.</p>
<p>“Honestly,” I said, “I really like the community hero idea. I’d really like you to try it again, after a bit. For that to be your way of working through it all, from influencing your friends to hurting that woman. We’re dealing with blame, not hate, and blame finds a place to roost eventually. There has to be another shot at making this happen.”</p>
<p>“Blame seems like too small a word for what Crystal was saying.”</p>
<p>“Blame can be big,” I said. “Blame has led to the ruin of nations.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “That sort of helps, actually.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to have sort of helped.”</p>
<p>“Blame can become something else, given time, can’t it?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It can,” I admitted. “I’m spooked at the idea it will. For now, just… be a hero,” I said. “Don’t walk away from this sort of thing for good.”</p>
<p>“You guys keep saying stuff to me, like, don’t run off, don’t sacrifice yourself, be a hero, as if it’s implied I’ve got ideas I haven’t said out loud.”</p>
<p>“You’re a self-described shitty person and an ex-villain. We’re not allowed to be suspicious?” I asked.</p>
<p>That got a half-smile out of her.</p>
<p>“Come on,” I said. “I’m getting worried about my guys and I’ll get yelled at by my boss if I leave them to their own devices for too long.”</p>
<p>“This is your thing, then?” she asked. She followed me as I left, setting her glass next to where I’d left mine. “You joined the junior-PRT to convince shitty people to be less shitty?”</p>
<p>“On the most basic level, I got into this because capes are what I know,” I said.</p>
<p>“Because you grew up with them.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but keep that under the lid for now,” I said. “I’m not broadcasting it to the world.”</p>
<p>“Lips zipped.”</p>
<p>I pushed the door open, stepping back into the now-empty conference room. “I want to help. I could have helped with construction or farming or whatever else, but like I said&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Capes are what you know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I knew so many great people and I don’t know if all of them made it, but I want to be in a position to help them through whatever comes next. I want to figure things out, because the lack of answers is what fucks us over, and fucks them over. I want to talk to people like you, if you happen to be on the fence, so maybe you land on the side where you’re more likely to help out those really cool, great people.”</p>
<p>“I thought you junior-PRT kids were all about training so you can go after the monsters.”</p>
<p>She’d created a hard green sphere, the size of a billiard ball. She tossed it between her hands as she had the glass. It smacked against each palm.</p>
<p>I answered her, “Don’t get me wrong, but I have pretty strong feelings when it comes to the monsters. I’m pretty far from being okay with them.”</p>
<p>She gave me a sidelong glance while opening the door to the main room.</p>
<p>“But I don’t think you’re one of them,” I said. “Sorry, but you’re safe from me.”</p>
<p>She threw the ball to the right, but instead of smacking into her palm, it curved in the air, orbiting her hand in a long ellipse as a moon might a planet.</p>
<p>“What a relief,” she said. She was smiling a bit more, now.</p>
<p>The smile faltered a bit more as we faced the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Some of the police had come inside. My guys were standing near the windows, looking out. Some were talking to the police.</p>
<p>A share of the crowd had remained behind. Community leaders, possibly.</p>
<p>Fume Hood hung back as I approached them all.</p>
<p>“You’re in charge?” a police officer asked. He had a mustache. It bothered me, because I’d never really <em>got</em> mustaches, barring the truly awesome ones. This was lip decoration, bristly and at odds with how his hair was combed back and close to his head.</p>
<p>“Yessir. I’m Victoria, I take my orders from Instructor Gilpatrick at Wayfair High School.”</p>
<p>“They said you told them to follow our orders?”</p>
<p>“Or to keep a lookout for trouble. There’s still people here? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“No,” the officer said. He sighed. “I don’t know what to do with them. Yours or with the others. Situation seems to be resolving itself, but the teenagers in uniform are insisting it isn’t.”</p>
<p>“The capes say it isn’t,” I said. “I’d believe them.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” he said.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, exhaling slowly, while the officer took a look around at the situation.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you talked to them?” I asked. “The capes?”</p>
<p>“A little bit,” he said. “Not recently. I don’t really know how.”</p>
<p>“They’re people,” I said. “Capable people who want to help.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got the eye thing, and the masks. One doesn’t have eyes at all,” he said. “He has these crystals. He pulled one out of the top of his head earlier, and it made a wet sound. It was in so deep it should’ve been inside his brain.”</p>
<p>“They’re people,” I said, again.</p>
<p>“It’s disconcerting,” the man said.</p>
<p>I wanted to say things to that, but I bit my tongue. I could hardly criticize when I’d been talking to Fume Hood.</p>
<p>I’d just&mdash; I’d really hoped for better.</p>
<p>“If you need me to be a liason, let me know,” I said. He didn’t give me an immediate response, so I called out to the squaddies. “Get back from the windows, guys! The working theory is a bomb, heavy impact, cape power, or something like an earthquake, and you don’t want your nose pressed against the glass when it comes!”</p>
<p>They shuffled back.</p>
<p>“Bomb?” the officer asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Can you get everyone here clear of danger?”</p>
<p>“To somewhere inside or further outside?”</p>
<p>I looked around. Crystalclear and the others hadn’t come to find us, so I was left to imagine the danger wasn’t super imminent. Inside posed risks.</p>
<p>I didn’t like making the calls, but I said, “Outside, but hurry it up. If there’s any remaining crowd outside, get them further back or get them to go.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said. “Makes sense.”</p>
<p>He whistled for the attention of his people and the crowd that had gathered closer to the front door.</p>
<p>While he handled that, I looked at the others, “Where’s Jasper?”</p>
<p>“Still out there. He has Mar and Landon with him. The crowd is in their way.”</p>
<p>I hurried to approach the window. I could hear a commotion behind me, as others entered the room, but my focus was on the commotion outside. My view was briefly blocked by the cops and the people they were leading outside and across the street to our left, away from both the building and the lingering protesters.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Crystalclear said, behind me. He was with a small few members of the community center staff, including the district rep, and he had Longscratch and Tempera with him.</p>
<p>He would be here because trouble was imminent.</p>
<p>“How soon?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Two impacts in a couple of minutes. Six or seven.”</p>
<p>Two. Six or seven minutes gave us a window to act.</p>
<p>I watched the scene in progress through the window. Jasper wouldn’t make it to the front door in two or three minutes. Some of the protest had dispersed, but a lot of it had spread out from the square of grass, sidewalks, fountain and trees just in front of the community center, dotting the streets. A share of them occupied the street Jasper needed to come down to reach us, and a lot of them had their back to him. He honked, not for the first time, and one of them gave him the finger.</p>
<p>“I’m going to help Jasper out, get us our bus so we can drive out of here without being mobbed,” I said. “Is there a side door?”</p>
<p>Crystalclear pointed at what would have been the south side of the building, to my left.</p>
<p>“Go there, stay clear of windows. Protect my people, keep them clear of danger. The moment there’s real trouble, they’re just high schoolers and should be treated as such. High schoolers&mdash; you guys protect Fume Hood. Protect the capes. Be good.”</p>
<p>“Do you need help?” Tempera asked.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help. She would cause more problems than she fixed, being in costume.</p>
<p>No. I shook my head, heading to the front door.</p>
<p>Was this an emergency? Yes.</p>
<p>Did I like using my power? No.</p>
<p>I marched toward the bus, glaring at the first person in my way. I activated my aura.</p>
<p>“Move,” I said, and I pushed out with my power. Heads turned, noticing. Maybe they would put their finger on why they’d noticed. Maybe not. I was nudging, here.</p>
<p>I could see the man’s reaction. He took a partial step back.</p>
<p>I stepped it up a notch, not with more use of my power, but by raising the volume of my voice. “Out of the way!”</p>
<p>He got out of the way. That and me drawing nearer made it easier for the next person to come through.</p>
<p>“Bus!” I called out to Jasper. “Get moving! Side door to the right of the building! South side!”</p>
<p>People looking back at the bus and back to me had more pressure to deal with. That was easier. They got clear of the bus’ path.</p>
<p>The one who had given Jasper the finger, though, he had just a little bit more to prove. I put my hands on him. I pushed him, and he resisted.</p>
<p>I pushed him with my aura, small, closer to center, a pulse of intimidation just for him, to break his posture and resolve. My hands pushed him the rest of the way. He landed on his ass.</p>
<p>He wasn’t wholly out of the way, but Jasper was able to drive up on the sidewalk. His door was open and the stairs leading up to his seat were there. I hopped up, grabbing the bar that the driver used to climb into the seat, hanging off the side.</p>
<p>“Things okay?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They’re about to be not okay,” I said. “We’ve got four or five minutes, probably. I want to be gone by&mdash;”</p>
<p>Jasper’s two passengers, Mar and Landon, were at the window behind Jasper’s seat. They were looking out and over my shoulder.</p>
<p>I turned to look. In the crowd, a man was standing there, shuddering. People were backing away from him.</p>
<p>He wore a black hooded sweatshirt and black pants, and he stood so the hood hid his face. His arms were at his side, vibrating. Head, arms, body and legs all moved like he had a paint shaker wedged up his ass, moving more violently by the second.</p>
<p>Building up to something.</p>
<p>“Take cover!” I shouted the words.</p>
<p>Some people did. They ran, they sprinted for mailboxes, for trees. But it was too open an area for everyone to find something.</p>
<p>I threw up my personal forcefield, shielding Jasper, my arm out toward the windows the other two were looking at.</p>
<p>The man in the crowd exploded, showering the crowd with chunks of bone, flesh, and a mist of blood. More than should have been contained in a human body. Some of the windows in the bus had cracked, and my forcefield was down.</p>
<p>The people over the square of grass, around the fountain, on the sidewalks and the streets surrounding the explosion all stood, calm.</p>
<p>Streaked with blood, they looked around, every single head turning left, then turning right. All in unison.</p>
<p>“Drive,” I said.</p>
<p>Jasper stomped on the gas.</p>
<p>Further up the street, the cops that had been evacuating people from the building and across the road were standing near the street. They’d been touched by the gore-explosion, and now they were drawing their guns.</p>
<p>“Don’t hit them!”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hit them!” Jasper called out, swerving so the side and then the rear of the bus was between us and them.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been five or six minutes yet. It couldn’t have been. The building hadn’t been hit yet.</p>
<p>I climbed up higher, standing on the headrest of Jasper’s seat to reach a higher point on the bus, looking over the roof.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>The worst possible location.</p>
<p>An eighteen wheeled logging truck was coming down the road. The front had been reinforced with metal braces. It was coming from the direction of the water, only four hundred or so feet of road between the waterline they’d started near and the community center, but it was going full speed, straight for the side door.</p>
<p>“Fuck me.” Jasper’s voice.</p>
<p>Even if Crystalclear saw&mdash;</p>
<p>“Hit it!” I called out.</p>
<p>“What? Are you insane?”</p>
<p>“Hit it! The others are waiting on the other side of the door!”</p>
<p>I scrambled to get in position.</p>
<p>“Trusting you,” Jasper said, and the bus picked up speed.</p>
<p><em>You shouldn’t</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>I had one partial glimpse of the inside of the truck.</p>
<p>Multiple costumes.</p>
<p>And then the impact.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap13">Daybreak &mdash; 1.4</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>There was no way to process the series of collisions that followed me hurling myself down between the logging truck and the school bus. My focus was on deflecting the impact, clawing at the logging truck with everything I had to try to put it off course, before the bus made contact and hopefully moved it further. As the two vehicles came together, I extended my whole body, trying to push them apart in a way that would keep the collision from being the head-on sort that might kill Jasper.</p>
<p>In no particular order, the school bus hit the logging truck, the logging truck hit the school bus and the wall, and I, my forcefields down, hit the ground rolling.</p>
<p>I came to a stop and lay where I was, face down. I felt the sting of the scrapes where I’d come into contact with the road, and waited for the real pain to start. I wanted to know where the real damage was before I moved the wrong part and made it worse. My ears rang from the sharp noises and impacts. Playing dead helped, too, because the villains were rousing, opening the door of the truck cab, glass tinkling down to the street below.</p>
<p>“What the hell?” someone asked. They were younger&mdash; probably teenager. I couldn’t pinpoint if they were male or female.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” a deeper voice asked. The nature of the voice made me think <em>brute</em>. “Any injuries?”</p>
<p>“I think I have whiplash,” the teenager said. “I wasn’t expecting that. What the hell?”</p>
<p>“You were intercepted before impact. It looks like teenagers in uniform. With a bus.”</p>
<p>“I can see that,” the teenager said.</p>
<p>“You missed the side door you were supposed to drive through.”</p>
<p>“I can see that too,” the teenager said.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell what you’re looking at, Blindside. Let me know if you need help. Snag?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” was the response, a rasp. I heard metal creak.</p>
<p>“Your arm isn’t,” the teenager said. They would be Blindside, going by what the Brute had said.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>I heard the sound of someone hopping down to land on the street, not all that far away from me. Metal struck the road shortly after.</p>
<p>I only saw a glimpse of him. Work boots, a long coat that hung down low enough that it almost looked like his legs were only two feet long, and arms long enough that his wrists made contact with the ground. The hands rested flat on the road, fingers splayed. He wore gauntlets.</p>
<p>I wanted to see something more than just his feet, but as I started to raise my eyes, looking through the hair that had come loose from my braid, my eyes were forced down, until they were staring at the road. I heard the scrape of another person’s feet as they climbed down from the truck to the street.</p>
<p>“My fucking neck,” Blindside said. The person in question.</p>
<p>Try as I might, I couldn’t look at them. My eyes and head refused to cooperate and do what was necessary to put them in my field of vision.</p>
<p>“Don’t complain,” said the Brute.</p>
<p>“You weren’t on the truck. You don’t get to tell me what I can or can’t complain about. Fuck, I wasn’t expecting that hit. Did both K.C. and Nursery fuck up?”</p>
<p>“The timing was wrong,” a woman said. Nursery, I assumed.</p>
<p>There were so many of them. The Brute, Snag, Blindside, Nursery, and K.C.&mdash; I really hoped that K.C. was the mass-master I’d seen in the crowd. If they weren’t, then there were six of them in total. Six and the crowd that the exploding parahuman had control of.</p>
<p>We had four capes on the inside, me, and a bunch of high schoolers, some of whom had guns. None of whom, cape or student, that I wanted involved in this conflict.</p>
<p>The five or six attacking capes wouldn’t be attacking like this if they weren’t sure they could win.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid,” Snag said, his voice a rough growl, volume raised.</p>
<p>He wasn’t talking to me. He was directing that at Jasper and the other two.</p>
<p><em>Drive away</em>, I thought, willing Jasper to think the same. <em>Be okay, drive away. Leave me</em>.</p>
<p>I heard the chugging of the bus, the battered engine protesting as the vehicle started to reverse, pulling away.</p>
<p>At the edge of my Blindside-limited field of vision, Snag’s metal, long-fingered hand lifted from the ground. He leaped toward the bus without making the movements necessary to jump. I didn’t want to move my head and risk being seen just to see him land, but I heard the metal-on-metal sound, the impact of a heavy body on the hood.</p>
<p>Every set of eyes, mine excepted, had to be on him and the retreating bus. It was an opening, and it was an opening our side opted to use. The side door of the building opened without a sound. Fume Hood and Crystalclear were in the doorway.</p>
<p>Crystalclear threw a chunk of crystal at the ground, and the chunk passed through without sound or apparent impact. Fume Hood had six green orbs with her, all around her hand. She sent one out in the direction of the bus, then, a moment later, sent a second. Both exploded, off to one side.</p>
<p>Crystalclear’s shot passed through walls. Tempera had let me know that. Apparently, it <em>needed</em> to pass through walls, or the ground in this case. He’d thrown it into the ground, and a moment after Fume had released her two shots, both landing, Crystalclear’s shot emerged from the ground, an explosion of vapor, glass splinters, and fragments of road.</p>
<p>One of the villains, the Brute, only laughed.</p>
<p>Fume Hood paused, her four orbs around her hand. Her head was turned so she could only see me with one eye&mdash; Blindside’s power was limiting them there.</p>
<p>Through the hair that had fallen over my face, I could see Fume Hood look at me. Making eye contact.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see the villains, so I knew the action was risky. I had to hope they were more focused on her than on me.</p>
<p>I raised my head up and motioned for her to go, moving one hand, swiping my fingers toward her.</p>
<p>The pattern was much the same as with her first shot. One shot, then firing the remaining three all at once. One to gauge how it would fly, then the rest to deliver the hit.</p>
<p>They slammed the door shut, just before the three near-simultaneous explosions. The detonations were small and sharp, and produced a wind that blew my hair away from my face. I held my breath.</p>
<p>The Brute laughed again.</p>
<p>I really didn’t want to pick a fight with four capes at once. The bus was gone, the door was shut.</p>
<p>“This is going to slow us down,” the Brute said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to sound so happy about it,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>The Brute chuckled, and climbed down from the roof of the truck, and in the doing, he put himself between me and Blindside. It blocked my view of Blindside, and it gave me a chance to get a glimpse of him. The ground smoked around where his boots touched pavement, and the smoke solidified into formations that looked like branches and twists of metal, all in an ashen white-grey. His entire body was made of the stuff, as if he wore armor made of white-grey bandages made solid and immobile by resin, all of the ends curling up and away from him in horns or branches.</p>
<p>I knew him, even just seeing his legs. Or I knew <em>of</em> him, to be precise. Yeah, based on what I knew of Fume Hood’s group, they might be outclassed.</p>
<p>The big guy was the Lord of Loss. There were two ways a cape could go with a name like that. The most obvious was to fuck up just <em>once</em>, and forever after have people wondering out loud what he was thinking, taking a name like that. Being called a loser.</p>
<p>The other way was to succeed and ascend the name, to take that name and make it a title. The Lord of Loss had managed that.</p>
<p>He had been one of the villains in a big city on the West coast, and now he was one of the villains running a settlement on one of the corner worlds. Was it Earth-N? Not far from here, if it was. He wasn’t top tier, as capes went, but he was A-list.</p>
<p>He was a Brute with Breaker flavor. He cloaked himself in abstract forms, with a set selection. I knew one resembled a bird, which he would have been using to fly alongside the truck. He was versatile, big, strong, and his breaker power multiplied his efforts over time. That multiplication played into how he flew, how he grew, and back before Gold Morning, a few occasions where he’d been able to slug away at a bank vault until he’d torn it open, or even drag a smaller vault away with him.</p>
<p>He turned his attention toward me, turning around and approaching me as the others backed away from the cloud of gas. My chin jerked toward my chest as Blindside stepped out to the side, back in my field of view.</p>
<p>I would’ve rather had just about anyone else step close enough for me to get my hands on them. It had to be the guy I couldn’t take out of the fight.</p>
<p>“Miss,” Lord of Loss said. “Are you injured?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t pretend to be unconscious&mdash; I’d just moved because of Blindside. I settled for an inarticulate, small moan.</p>
<p>Lord of Loss knelt beside me. “Can you walk?”</p>
<p>I shook my head, keeping the movement small.</p>
<p>“Is it because your back is hurt? Can you feel my hand, here?” he asked.</p>
<p>I felt his hand touch my knee.</p>
<p>I nodded, again, small. I screwed up my face, feigning more pain than I was in.</p>
<p>I didn’t like this. I didn’t like being so close to the guy, I didn’t like the scrutiny, the eyes on me, the attention. I didn’t like being treated like I was an invalid. I didn’t like suppressing my forcefield and aura.</p>
<p>I didn’t like being still.</p>
<p>It was easier to keep my composure if I was moving, <em>doing</em>.</p>
<p>“Blindside,” Lord of Loss said. “Watch her.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You were always going to be the lookout, with Kingdom Come helping. We stick to the plan. We’re going in, we’ll get our target, you’ll be the lookout, and you’ll look out for this junior soldier while you’re at it.”</p>
<p>“Pain in the ass.”</p>
<p>“Plans change,” Lord of Loss said. “You’ll learn that sooner or later. Our clients hired us to capture an ex-villain who made a bystander lose her child. I don’t think they’d be pleased if we let another bystander get hurt while we carry out the task.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, no, I get it. Just go. Let’s get this over with.”</p>
<p>“Keep an eye out for the vehicle with the other soldiers. They drove in Kingdom’s direction. If they can’t get through or around, they might come back.”</p>
<p>“I get it. It’s fine. <em>Go</em>. I can handle my shit.”</p>
<p>My eyes had closed, because it kept my head from being jerked around as Blindside kept compelling me to move to avoid seeing them, but I could tell when Lord of Loss moved away, as the bulk of his body ceased blocking the light of the sun above us.</p>
<p>“Snag,” Lord of Loss said. “Any injury?”</p>
<p>I heard a cough. “No.”</p>
<p>“Then go with Nursery,” Lord of Loss said. He paused. “Kingdom Come?”</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“It’s time. Move in,” Lord of Loss said. “I can’t go inside, so I’ll take the roof, I’ll watch the other sides of the building, and do what I can to help.”</p>
<p>I cracked my eyes open. Nursery and Snag were walking up to the door. Lord of Loss was breaking into pieces, his arms spreading out as the wispy smoke formed into the ‘feathers’ of his wings. He wasn’t fast at all as he started to flap, lifting off the ground.</p>
<p>That would be the downside of his breaker power. It let him hit harder every time he hit something, and that included the beats of wing against air, but it took time.</p>
<p>Still, it let him move in the direction of the roof. He paused, circling, as Snag raised one long arm and pushed at the door. White paint leaked around the doorframe.</p>
<p>Sealed shut.</p>
<p>“This would be why I’m here,” Nursery said, her voice soft. She began humming, and it was a lullaby sort of hum.</p>
<p>A music box sort of chiming joined the humming.</p>
<p>“Fuck that shit,” Blindside said. I was the closest person to them as they stood somewhere near me. I lay near the butt end of the eighteen wheeler, which had its nose in the wall of the building. Nursery and Snag were at the door. I wasn’t sure if Blindside was talking to me.</p>
<p>The humming seemed to be picked up elsewhere, and the music box noises intensified, with new notes and a higher tempo. The area near the door blurred. It was a window into another world, what had to be a pocket dimension, but for the most part it seemed unsure if it was our world or the pocket world.</p>
<p>An indoor setting, at a glance. Beds and walls that didn’t line up with things in our world.</p>
<p>I felt Blindside’s hand on my neck. They felt for my pulse.</p>
<p>“Asshole is invincible, and so he doesn’t even think to get your gun from you. You’re lying on it,” Blindside said. “If I roll you onto your back, will it kill you?”</p>
<p>It was a question I’d heard variants of before, in a tone I’d heard before. A tone from someone that didn’t really care about me.</p>
<p><em>We’re going to roll you over now and check for sores. Is that alright?</em></p>
<p><em>We’re going to wash you now. Can you try to move this arm?</em></p>
<p><em>Can I get you anything? Would you like water, or something to eat?<br>
</em></p>
<p>Condescending, caring more about themselves, feigning concern or consideration. They just wanted to get on with their day. Even the ones that did care lost patience sometimes. Stubborn, aggressive people like me made it easy to lose patience.</p>
<p>I made myself be calm. I exhaled slowly, and the exhalation came out as a shudder. It wasn’t because I was hurt, but because the memories were close to the surface.</p>
<p>Blindside eased me onto my back, then I felt them touch my gun.</p>
<p>My eyes snapped open. My arm lashed out, one swing, mindful that they were probably just a fragile human being.</p>
<p>I didn’t make contact. Muscles in my arm wrenched, seized, and cramped as the entire arm locked up, just in time to keep me from touching them.</p>
<p>“Aha,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>I felt them grip my gun hard. My initial fumble to grab the gun ran into the same problem. My hand hit an imaginary wall.</p>
<p>The gun had a buckle keeping it in the hip holster. They hadn’t undone the buckle, and they weren’t able to pull the gun free before I jumped up to my feet, backing a short distance away. The hand pulled free.</p>
<p>I still couldn’t see them. My head was turned to one side, I had a glare on my face, and I walked slowly, keeping track of them by keeping them at the very edge of my field of view.</p>
<p>I imagined I looked a little feral, pacing as I was, trying to track them with my other senses, being unable to make eye contact.</p>
<p>I moved my hand experimentally. I hit the wall.</p>
<p>I couldn’t point at them, then. I couldn’t hit them, based on my earlier issue.</p>
<p>“What do they feed you shits?” Blindside asked. “You get thrown from a bus mid-impact and you have it in you to pull this? I’m impressed.”</p>
<p>The dreamy blur was disappearing, the way in closing behind Nursery and Snag. The background humming and chiming was fading.</p>
<p>I hoped the others were retreating, finding a place in the building they could hunker down until help came.</p>
<p>“Listen,” Blindside said. “I don’t want trouble. I don’t want to hurt a civilian. I’m keeping to the rules. Lie down, put your hands on your head, let me take the gun. I’ll give it back when I’m done.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to kidnap Fume Hood. I can’t stand by and let that happen.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do anything about it,” Blindside said. “We’re going to borrow them, then we’ll be on our way.”</p>
<p>“Borrow? You’re giving her back after? Unharmed?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Mostly unharmed. The woman who lost her kid wants to have words with her. Shout at her, make her feel bad. She and some others paid a lot of money to make it happen. Then we drop her back off somewhere near here and drive off.”</p>
<p>“For that, you drive a truck into a building and traumatize a crowd?”</p>
<p>“Intel said we were good to hit the building there, use that as our entry point. Scaring her was part of the deal, so was fucking her over,” Blindside said. “Stirring up the crowd, it doesn’t affect us much. We live in one of the corners. For her, it keeps her from finding any success.”</p>
<p>“For the sake of the woman who lost her child?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And she’s personally going to shout at Fume Hood there?”</p>
<p>“Fume Hood, Bad Apple, Horse Apple, Apple Cider, whatever you want to call her. Yeah.”</p>
<p>I nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“Just lie down. Let it be. Give up the gun, stop fighting, we do our cape shit and you carry on with your day. Police are under our control, nearest capes are half an hour away. This is the way it is sometimes.”</p>
<p>“The files I got when I accepted this job said the woman in question died,” I said. “The pregnant lady who lost her child.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>I nodded, my eyes still fixed on the ground, as close to Blindside as I could get. If they moved into my field of vision, a forced movement of my eye and head would let me know.</p>
<p>“At Gold Morning. Her home address was one of the cities hit hard. No sign of her after the fact. Authorities investigated when the word about this attack first came up. Which leads me to think you’re lying through your teeth.”</p>
<p>“People visit family, go out of town for work, have stays in the hospital… I can’t tell you how many times I’ve talked to people who narrowly dodged being in the wrong place at that one critical time.”</p>
<p>“Stop,” I said. “I caught you in one lie, let’s leave it at that.”</p>
<p>Blindside fell silent.</p>
<p>I heard a scuff. My head turned-was allowed to turn&mdash; as Blindside moved around to my side. I backed away a few paces.</p>
<p>I heard Blindside stop moving.</p>
<p>“Change your stance,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>“My stance?”</p>
<p>“Your head is turned as far to the right as it can go. If I move to your right, the reflex is going to be to move your head further right. You could snap your neck. You’d probably close your eyes first, but I’d rather not risk it.”</p>
<p>I obliged, shifting where my shoulders were, so my left shoulder pointed at them. I was aware that it made it easier to circle behind me.</p>
<p>“And raise your chin a bit.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of Blindside moving too late. I reached out to block or catch the incoming attack, and hit the wall where I couldn’t move my arm too far toward them.</p>
<p>Something swung at an angle that avoided my arm. I brought my forcefield up just in time for the thing to hit me on the chin. An uppercut with a blunt instrument that should have broken my jaw.</p>
<p>Before Blindside could recover or figure out what had happened, I went on the offense. I couldn’t hit them with my hand, I couldn’t point at them, but if I swung my hand at them, elbow jutting out&mdash;</p>
<p>I felt muscles seize, locking up. Blindside caught my arm, pushing me in the direction I’d already been going, and shoved me to the ground. Martial art.</p>
<p>The blunt instrument-I saw the tip of a metal bat&mdash; struck down toward my shin.</p>
<p>It rebounded off of the forcefield as the field came back. The metal sang.</p>
<p>“Ah fucking hah,” Blindside said. “Fuck me. You’re a cape.”</p>
<p>I lurched to my feet, putting some distance between myself and them.</p>
<p>Elbows didn’t work either.</p>
<p>The muscles in my arm and shoulder twitched with the lingering strain or sprain that had gone with the interruption.</p>
<p>I backed away until my forcefield came back up. I drew in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“You’re full of surprises,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>I undid a buckle and pulled my armored vest over my head in one smooth motion.</p>
<p>“That’s not very surprising though,” they said. “I can see where you’re going with this. I’ve been at this a few years. Some of the workarounds and tricks are getting old by now.”</p>
<p>I shifted my grip so I held the vest by the shoulder.</p>
<p>“The bus is back. Are they capes in disguise too?”</p>
<p>The bus was back? I couldn’t see without looking past Blindside, and I didn’t want to lose my bearings.</p>
<p>They were watching then?</p>
<p>Well, I imagined Blindside made it hard to watch.</p>
<p>I swung, using the vest as a bludgeon. My arm stopped, but the vest continued.</p>
<p>I felt hands against my back, gripping the back of my top. Another move, Judo or Aikido, stepping into arm’s reach, too close for the vest to hit me, trusting their power to keep my arm from hitting them, and throwing me to the ground.</p>
<p>I used my forcefield, and I used its strength to arrest the movement, stopping myself. A bit of my flight.</p>
<p>With Blindside directly behind me, I drew my gun, and I turned to the right this time, swinging out with gun in hand.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Blindside said. “That won’t&mdash;”</p>
<p>I dropped the vest, my hand going to my ear, and I fired the instant my arm stopped moving. I shot the stone wall of the community center eight times.</p>
<p>The volume of it was such that I only barely heard Blindside’s exclamation of pain. My ears rang&mdash; but the gun had to have been right next to the villain mercenary’s ear.</p>
<p>This was how I operated. Even if I was trying not to be too blatant with others watching. I was trying to consider more before I acted and took this route, moderating myself.</p>
<p>Shock. Shake them on a sensory level.</p>
<p>I stooped low to pick up the vest, then swung it as I had before. Blindside stumbled forward, much as they had before, into my reach, both forearms pressing against my back.</p>
<p>I’d had to moderate my aura, back at the hospital. My mood darkened even thinking about that time, much as it had darkened when I saw myself in the mirror and remembered what I had been.</p>
<p>It took all I had to not let that darkness affect how I handled the aura. I’d told myself, so many times, I wanted to be <em>better</em>. Regrets weren’t worth anything if I didn’t let them drive me to do it better in the future.</p>
<p>For two months my aura had been one of the only real communication tools that I had, that didn’t require rounds of blinking and interpretation, or fumbling at a special keyboard with hands that didn’t map to how my brain thought my body should move. I’d had some practice with the nuance of it.</p>
<p>Blindside was pressing against my back, and my aura was stronger the closer people were to me. I controlled the aura’s expression to keep it small and more concentrated.</p>
<p>Awe. Catch them on an emotional level.</p>
<p>Blindside stumbled back.</p>
<p>I spun around in the other direction, and bludgeoned them with the weight of my vest, using it like a flail. They bounced off of the logging truck and collapsed.</p>
<p>Destroy was my usual third step. I hoped I’d held back enough. I’d wanted to disable only, but it was hard to know my own strength.</p>
<p>“You conscious?” I asked the villain. My own voice sounded far away, distorted, hard to hear over the ringing.</p>
<p>I should have heard any response. I didn’t. Silence.</p>
<p>Blindside’s power didn’t let me check their condition, visually or otherwise.</p>
<p>I bent over them, fumbling, tracing their outline with the back of my hand, and finding walls even there, somehow. I found their head, medium length hair, and tried to press the back of my hand against their ear. My arm muscles seized.</p>
<p>I tried to use my knuckles to get into the ear, since I couldn’t use my fingertips without pointing or driving them toward Blindside, and I still hit the wall.</p>
<p>Blindside had been using something to communicate with others. If it was a walkie-talkie, phone, or earpiece, it wasn’t anywhere I could access it. Blindside’s power protected them.</p>
<p>The movement in the corner of my eye caught me off guard. The bus. The front corner was badly damaged, but it was chugging along somehow. I hadn’t heard it approaching. Where the paint had been black, it had broken away, revealing some of the bright yellow paint that it had once had, when it had been a school bus.</p>
<p>Jasper was waving his arm out the window, pointing. I could hear his shouts, but the words were muted.</p>
<p>Incoming.</p>
<p>The villains would have heard the shots.</p>
<p>I looked up, and I saw Lord of Loss at the roof’s edge. He’d turned himself into something resembling a tree. A static emplacement, less able to move, but with roots that would extend into the building and secure his position so he could leverage his full strength.</p>
<p>He was growing by the second, smoke billowing out and solidifying into branching points. He might just have the reach to hit us down on the street level, big as he was.</p>
<p>There were two entry points that weren’t windows. Two courses of action stood out to me. The first was to simply fly to a window, abandon Jasper. I’d lose my job, but I would have to trust they would leave and be safe while I did what I could to help Fume Hood.</p>
<p>But I had something I wanted to ask.</p>
<p>I motioned for them to come, to hurry.</p>
<p>There were two doors into the building that I knew about. The front door was no doubt seized by the mind-controlled army. The side door had been painted. I wasn’t sure I wanted to tear my way in and find out that the paint was a problem.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to charge in, only to find that they were securing their retreat. They’d be looking for trouble coming from either of the entrances after hearing the shots.</p>
<p>There might have been a third way in.</p>
<p>I ran toward the nose of the eighteen wheeled logging truck, and I climbed over the nose of it. It had collided with the wall, and it had done some damage.</p>
<p>Reaching up, I pulled at the damaged part overhead, and I leveraged the strength my forcefield provided to tear it away. I pushed at another part, widening the gap.</p>
<p>The bus parked so its nose was tucked into the corner between the nose of the logging truck and the wall. Jasper, Mar, and Landon climbed out of the bus.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Jasper asked.</p>
<p>I liked that it was the first thing he’d asked. Gilpatrick’s five pound of gun speech taken to heart. Less than five pounds of weaponry, more than fifteen pounds of protection, twenty five pounds of support and problem solving. Jasper’s first thoughts were on the latter. Those were supposed to be the priorities, the ratios.</p>
<p>“A bit of road rash,” I said, examining my arms. “Too much adrenaline to feel the pain.”</p>
<p>Shadows shifted. Lord of Loss had decided to detach from the roof, and was pulling himself together enough to start climbing down.</p>
<p>“Come on,” I said.</p>
<p>We ducked in through the gap, into a staff washroom. I couldn’t see the source of the water, but it pooled on the floor below. We passed through the door and into the hallway.</p>
<p>“So you’re a cape,” Mar said. He’d been the kid who’d sat behind me on the bus and made smug insinuations about my name and background.</p>
<p>I gave him a dark look. It looked like Landon was on his side.</p>
<p>“You’ve got blood on your upper lip,” Mar said. “It looks like you’ve got a mustache.”</p>
<p>“Fuck off, Mar,” Jasper said.</p>
<p>I rubbed at my upper lip with the side of my hand, looking back to make sure Lord of Loss hadn’t followed us.</p>
<p>I could hear the humming and the music box. Upstairs somewhere. I could hear people in the building.</p>
<p>“Jasper,” I said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I have to ask. How much of this is setup?”</p>
<p>“Setup?” Mar asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>“I know I sound paranoid,” I said. “I know if there’s a scenario or something, it’s probably against the rules to ask or answer, but I need the honest truth here, no bullshit.”</p>
<p>“You sound <em>really</em> fucking paranoid,” Mar said. “Holy fuck, you capes are screwed up in the head.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Mar,” Jasper said.</p>
<p>“Just answer, please,” I said, my eyes fixed on the end of the hallway, watching for the mind-controlled soldiers. “Gilpatrick set me up with a bunch of new soldiers I don’t know that he can somehow vouch for, he insisted on them, and he sent me into a situation that was liable to get messy. It doesn’t make sense unless I somehow imagine I’m being set up to fail.”</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” Mar said.</p>
<p>“It’s not really setup,” Jasper said. “Gilpatrick explained before I left.”</p>
<p>I nodded to myself.</p>
<p>“They wanted to make sure you could be trusted. They thought they’d stick you with some objective observers for three, four routine jobs, make sure you stuck to the rules, grade you, leave it at that.”</p>
<p>Objective. I looked at Mar.</p>
<p>Yeah. Right.</p>
<p>“And if I didn’t accept the job? If I’d told Gilpatrick I didn’t want to do this patrol?”</p>
<p>“He really thought you would,” Jasper said. “He told me that. He was a bit stuck, caught between superiors saying he had to make you or he couldn’t keep you on, and thinking you wouldn’t. Then you said yes.”</p>
<p>I frowned. One impulse. One spur-of-the-moment decision.</p>
<p>Cause and effect. Every time I acted on impulse, bad things happened. Some of the worst things had happened. People around me got hurt. I got hurt. Two years in the hospital.</p>
<p>It was so much of why I’d wanted to slow down.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty fucking glad you said yes,” Jasper said. “If it had been me in charge here I’m pretty sure most of us would be dead already.”</p>
<p>I exhaled. Deep breaths. I couldn’t fall into the mindset of dwelling on the past.</p>
<p>“You’re a good guy, Jasper.”</p>
<p>“I try,” he said.</p>
<p>I paused, thinking for a moment, listening to the noises elsewhere in the building.</p>
<p>I glanced at Landon and Mar.</p>
<p>“I’m a good guy too,” Mar said.</p>
<p>“Stay put,” I said, firm.</p>
<p>“You’re going alone?” Jasper asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Just find a corner of the building to hole up in. Hide, be safe.”</p>
<p>There was a balance to be struck. I wanted to think I’d reasoned this through, as much as I could with the time constraint, the enemy no doubt closing in on the capes. It was too risky to bring these guys with.</p>
<p>Going alone.</p>
<p>“Stay,” I said. “Be safe.”</p>
<p>I sprinted off, raising my forcefield for good measure.</p>
<p>I entered the kitchen by another door. Where I’d talked with Fume Hood.</p>
<p>Something exploded overhead.</p>
<p>I looked up.</p>
<p>Vapor, shards of crystal.</p>
<p>A moment later, there were two more small explosions, one after another, in a line.</p>
<p><em>Crystal clear, Crystalclear.</em></p>
<p>Not alone, then. I hurried in the direction indicated.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap14">Daybreak &mdash; 1.5</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>I paused at one of the doors of the kitchen. I’d come in one door and there were two more. One led to a hallway with people standing stationary at the end. Another led to the main room, where everyone had been seated before this had begun.</p>
<p>Crystalclear hadn’t signaled me further, and I took that to mean I was supposed to pause or wait. People in the main room were moving around. I peered through a crack in the door to see if there was an opening, a break in the ranks I could use to slip through or get something done.</p>
<p>I saw the people Kingdom Come had controlled had settled in, most finding seats in the folding chairs that had been set up throughout the room. Some stood around the side or sat with their backs to the wall. Others stood at the windows, watching outside.</p>
<p>The majority of the crowd was at rest. The ones who weren’t had guns drawn. The police officers were among them.</p>
<p>The officer with the sad mustache was at the front of the room, face streaked with blood. He was talking, and I couldn’t see who he was talking to.</p>
<p>I listened to the conversation, two people talking against a faint background of a chorus of hums and music box sounds.</p>
<p>“You want me to negotiate with terrorists,” a woman said.</p>
<p>“We want you to do what is best for your community,” the police officer said, in a very different voice than he’d used earlier.</p>
<p>“By playing along?”</p>
<p>“This started with civilians, it involves cape on cape violence,” the officer said. “If you cooperate, we’ll pay for damage done, we’ll extend our protection over your community in a way that keeps capes out of sight and mostly out of mind.”</p>
<p>“A protection racket?”</p>
<p>“Not a racket. No money or expectations. We’ll take the woman and we’ll tell you what to do in order to smooth things over.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why. What does this serve? Fume Hood was upfront about her history. She wanted to serve her time in this way.”</p>
<p>“If we tell you why, will you cooperate?”</p>
<p>“I can’t promise that,” the woman said. I was assuming she was the District Rep. Why had she left the others?</p>
<p>“The City is like a pressure cooker. The pressure is mounting and has been for a while. Things inside are heating up and winter is fast approaching. A number of great thinkers seem to think we need to vent the&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Vent the pressure?” the District Rep asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the police officer said. “The&mdash;”</p>
<p>There was an explosion overhead. Another of Crystalclear’s shots. Two more, leading from one corner of the room and away.</p>
<p>I looked at the crowd, and I saw the person closest to me staring at me.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come knew, he’d seen.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue this conversation shortly. You’ve got a cape with a gun inside the building.”</p>
<p>I backed away. Crystalclear created more explosions close to the other door. The people who had been standing guard at the end of the hallway, probably.</p>
<p>I retreated, ducking behind a counter.</p>
<p>They entered the room simultaneously, doors banging against the wall.</p>
<p>I ducked down, staying behind cover.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who fought Blindside?” the one at the door asked. The police officer.</p>
<p>I remained silent.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to shed any blood that isn’t mine,” he said. He was moving deeper into the room. I heard the door squeak, peeked, and saw the corner of it. It had been opened and was being held open. Another person?</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said.</p>
<p>One of the issues of being a parahuman was that there wasn’t a history to build on or a peerage to draw from. We had powers, yes. Some of those powers were similar to the powers others had, but there were almost always tricks and caveats, strengths one person had that another didn’t. I couldn’t copy Alexandria’s old tactics and style because my invincibility worked differently. Timing was so much more important to me.</p>
<p>I could be shot, if my timing was wrong, or if their timing was especially right.</p>
<p>A person like Jasper could take classes in martial arts and get lessons on the range, and he could use tools and draw on the experience of millions of others who had bodies that worked like his did, a set of capabilities that were virtually identical to his own.</p>
<p>There was only one Victoria Dallon with Victoria Dallon’s powers. I had to lean heavily on my own experience. In exercising my abilities, there was a point beyond which I was the only person that could teach myself &mdash; nobody resembled me closely enough to be an instructor in how to fight, how to process, or how to or pass on their experience.</p>
<p>But my own experience was a drawback if I was caught in the moment, where I had to rely on instinct but that instinct pointed me right back to my old ways.</p>
<p>These people were innocent. The officer, the others at the door. Maybe some had been protesters. Kingdom Come had no issue in using them, but I couldn’t hurt his pawns.</p>
<p>He could have moved them as a group, but he didn’t. He moved like a chessmaster played chess. One person taking a new position, pausing, checking the area, then another person moving. The police officer in charge &mdash;chief or sheriff, I wasn’t sure&mdash; had stopped in the center of the room. Others were moving around the perimeter.</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse of one by the gun he was holding, and moved around the corner. They all moved the same way when they moved, pistols held up, gripped in two hands that were dotted in drops of drying blood, pointed at the ceiling. I saw the gun before I saw the rest of him.</p>
<p>The lullaby continued, faint and distant. It wasn’t enough to obscure any scuffle I made. I didn’t want to make noise, and whatever the movies showed, it was hard to crawl around while wearing boots and be sure to not make any sound.</p>
<p>I didn’t like flying. I wasn’t confident in it like I had been. Two years had passed in the hospital, and my sense of flight had been as disturbed as the movement of my arm or my attempts at vocalization. It was supposed to be back, but it was a muscle I hadn’t exercised.</p>
<p>I <em>wanted</em> to fly, but it was tainted.</p>
<p>I raised myself off the ground, still hunched over, staying low enough that the counters would block me from sight, and used flight as much as light pushes on the sides of the cabinet to propel myself away from the advancing gunman.</p>
<p>I had other training to draw on that wasn’t self-taught. There was what I’d learned and absorbed from time with family, but that whole experience was so full of pitfalls I barely wanted to touch on it.</p>
<p>The Wards. I hadn’t been with them for long. I’d absorbed some things from Dean, because I <i>lived</i> the cape stuff and Dean was willing to teach it. I’d studied up and I’d taken the tests. I knew the numbers and the labels. I knew the approach formations for squads. Simple, making conflict with parahumans as textbook as possible, black ink on white paper, sans serif.</p>
<p>In fighting that perpetual battle of trying to think things through and still act in time, the classifications were a nice shortcut. Apply the label, assume what worked against most people of one classification, and if it clearly didn’t, it was still a starting point.</p>
<p>He was edging closer.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come was a breaker and a master. He had a toggled state that changed the rules as they pertained to him. Shake, blow up, and he was now a horde of people controlled by the bodily fluids on them. Masters were second highest priority as targets, breakers were targets that required timing, often hitting them when they were in the state that they were weakest.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come made that complicated by not giving me a body to target.</p>
<p>They were closing in. They’d crossed the length of the room and if I had to guess, four of them were standing within fifteen feet of me, guns held high, where it would be that much harder for me to lunge for the weapon. He didn’t have perfect coordination of their movements, I had to assume, unless they were all doing the same thing, like when the crowd had turned their heads.</p>
<p>The old me would have dealt with this by blitzing them. Hit each hard, fast, before they had a chance to react. Some minor harm would have come to innocents, but the situation would be resolved.</p>
<p>The current me waited, staying silent, letting them get close. One to my left, one in the middle avenue of the kitchen, between the two rows of counter-islands, and one on the far right, furthest from me.</p>
<p>As I set my boot down on the floor, ready to move, Crystalclear volunteered his help. An explosion at the ceiling, a few feet behind the guy to my left.</p>
<p>He spun around, looking, and I took advantage, leaping over the counter, reaching for the gun he held aloft. I seized it and his hands, and pulled both to the ground, where the counters kept us out of sight of the other two.</p>
<p>They started to approach at a run, each around one end of the counter, so they’d catch me on both sides, and Crystalclear offered another blast between me and them. It took out the light fixture above, and cast the corner of the room into shadow, illuminated by periodic sparks.</p>
<p>It gave me a moment’s pause to think. I ignored the man I’d brought to the ground, as I held his hands and the gun. I didn’t even need my strength&mdash; only leverage and my body weight.</p>
<p>I couldn’t do anything to him that would put him down for good without risking hurting the real person. I couldn’t do anything to Kingdom Come, as much as the rule for dealing with masters said I should. He didn’t have a material body.</p>
<p>I used a burst of strength and tore the gun from the one man’s hands, sliding it along the floor so it went under one of the appliances. I’d gone high to go after the first one, so I went low as I went after the officer to my left, throwing myself around the counter, using a bit of flight to help keep up my speed as I went around the corner.</p>
<p>I tackled him to the ground, holding him as we went down to keep the impact from being too hard. I’d managed to get one hand around his wrist, and as he pulled his other hand away, gripping the gun, I seized that wrist too.</p>
<p>That left one in the middle of the room, one unarmed and on the ground and no doubt climbing to his feet, and one coming around the corner, gun ready.</p>
<p>I flew, sliding the police officer along the floor. I twisted to hit the cabinet with my shoulder as we reached the end of the row. That would bruise tomorrow. I flew again, to move another direction, keeping away from the rest.</p>
<p>As we stopped, the officer had enough in the way of bearings to drop the gun. He drew his knee toward his chest, and then kicked the gun so it would slide on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Someone stepped through the doorway, stooping low and catching the gun in a way that wouldn’t have been possible if they hadn’t had a greater awareness.</p>
<p>No, as much as he was a master in execution, he was also a breaker. I had to be sensible. It didn’t make sense to fight a breaker like this when he was in his breaker state.</p>
<p>I pushed the police chief away, and then, reorienting, I flew straight up, through the ceiling. I felt my forcefield go down, bracing myself in case I brushed up against any wiring.</p>
<p>Second floor. I checked my surroundings. None of Kingdom Come’s people. The lullaby music was louder. The drones would arrive soon. I moved, hurrying down the hall.</p>
<p>I found the stairwell. I stepped into it, glancing down. No sign of an approach.</p>
<p>I peeled some of the metal away from the railing, stepped back into the hallway, and leveraged my strength to twist the metal around the door handle, to seal it shut. I knew there could be other stairwells, but at least this way I’d hear them if they tried coming this way.</p>
<p>Covering my back.</p>
<p>Priorities. Blindside was as classic a stranger as I’d ever dealt with. Out of action or out of consideration for now.</p>
<p>Lord of Loss was a brute. Textbook answer when faced with a brute was to ignore them as much as they allowed you to. It would take too much effort and it would take too much time when dealing with someone who couldn’t be decisively dealt with.</p>
<p>I could remember studying the PRT paperwork with Dean, doing the quizzes. He’d said the rule for brutes had an unofficial second part. That as much as you might try to put them off, they had a way of making you deal with them.</p>
<p>What had I said in response to that? I was a brute on paper.</p>
<p>Had that been the study session we’d had in my room? Dean would have been leaning against a pile of pillows at the head of my bed, Lyo-Leo on his lap, while Dean pretended to have him read the answers. I’d been sitting at the foot of the bed, papers and books strewn between us. Real homework and superhero stuff.</p>
<p>The door had been left open, at my dad’s insistence. One foot tucked under me, I’d snuck my one foot across the bed until I could touch Dean’s knee, trace my toe along his leg. Seeing if I could break his focus enough to make him mess up while reading aloud.</p>
<p>No, wait, that had been a few days after Dean had reminded me of the brute rule. I’d been studying it with more interest because Dean was turning eighteen before long, and we were worried he’d get moved to another city, even with his family situation being what it was. I’d seriously been considering joining the Wards and then the Protectorate, so I could follow him.</p>
<p>But I’d told my stuffed lion that he needed to remind Dean that brutes like me had a way of making you deal with them. They could only be ignored for so long.</p>
<p>Normally clever Dean had been at a loss for words. He’d grabbed my toe and squeezed it. I’d wiggled it in his hand. We’d been familiar enough with each other that the silence that followed didn’t feel bad. Awkward in a good way, even.</p>
<p>He’d, after a long pause, found the clever thing to say, but he’d stumbled his way through it. <em>It would be my pleasure</em>. Pause. <em>To deal with you</em>.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been long after that that we’d had our first night together. It had taken two days of desperate attempts at coordinating schedules and patrols, for me to get out without family wanting to join me, for Dean to avoid the ‘sidekick’ situation and go out in costume without a Protectorate member joining him.</p>
<p>My heart hurt, thinking of Dean. My knight in shining armor.</p>
<p>Still, I smiled as I remembered some of the emails we’d exchanged, my hands resting on the metal I’d used to lock the door. Dean, ever the gentleman, had wanted to negotiate and check everything, from my comfort levels about X, Y, and Z to how my personal forcefield would factor into our time together.</p>
<p>I’d laughed at that, which had been the tip-off for Amy to realize something was up. She’d&mdash;</p>
<p>And I’d gone and done it. Let my guard down, tripped over the stumbling block, stepped on the emotional landmine. There was only the hurt, now, none of the mixed, warm feeling that came from thinking about Dean.</p>
<p>I pushed it all out of mind. It wasn’t the time for that anyway. I was prone to getting lost in thought, even though it sometimes felt like every path led to the same, regrettable destination.</p>
<p>Dry, deliberate classifications. Moving forward. Deep breaths, when my chest hurt enough that breathing was hard. Back to numbers and labels. Lord of Loss and Kingdom Come had to be ignored, but I could trust that Lord of Loss would come into the picture somewhere along the line. We still had to get out of here or deal with him.</p>
<p>Nursery was close enough for me to hear the hums and chimes. Shaker, clearly. Not dissimilar to Labyrinth from back in Brockton Bay. The rule for dealing with shakers was to avoid fighting them on their own turf.</p>
<p>Snag was changer or tinker, possibly striker. Those arms. He had something mover going on with how he’d gone after the bus Jasper was driving.</p>
<p>Still, there might be another in play.</p>
<p>I ventured down the hallway, still feeling that ache in my chest, feeling acutely aware of my own body, the way clothes constrained me, reaffirmed me, yet every reaffirmation was a reminder that I needed that small reminder in the first place, and why.</p>
<p>My hand brushed against the wall as I walked. The closer to the north end of the building I got, the more of the lullaby I could hear. Multiple sources formed the humming, soft around the edges, each slightly out of sync with the others in a way that suggested they all came from different places.</p>
<p>I felt the texture of the wall change. Smoother. I felt and saw the difference in texture and color, respectively. Gray and dusty rose shades, as if seen through a filter. The wall had become a painted surface that felt as if it had been painted over many times, some droplets having run down the wall and set in place, ridges elsewhere where similar bumps had been painted over and become a faint rise.</p>
<p>I could hear <em>her</em> now. Nursery. A human’s hum, joined by all the others. She was close.</p>
<p>Peering around the corner of the T-shaped junction, I didn’t see her, but I saw the change. Her turf, as it was. Dusty rose carpet, picture frames with simple things like animals and boats in grays, blacks, and pale pinks. A crib, white, covered with a quilt.</p>
<p>I stayed at the edges of it, going further down the hall rather than turning the corner and venturing into her realm. Only the wall to my right was affected. A baby carriage draped in a blanket was parked beside a small bookshelf that had been stacked with children’s books and building blocks. The cloth stuck as if it had been taped down or the sheer amount of time it had been there had nearly fused it to the fabric of the carriage, producing a tearing sound reminiscent of Velcro. The carriage was empty, except for a vague oblong stain on the seat’s back and the seat itself.</p>
<p>When I left it behind, though, I could tell that there was humming coming from that vicinity, one of the soft, vague hums in the grander chorus.</p>
<p>Fuck me.</p>
<p>Every five or ten feet, there were more. A car seat removed from the car, handle up, blanket over it. Another crib, a much-used blanket tangled in the mobile, a child’s wagon. Toys, clocks, wall decorations, cardboard boxes stuffed of baby clothes, marked for ages zero to three. A rocking horse and more.</p>
<p>I was forced to venture further into it to get closer to the true sound’s source.</p>
<p>I saw her. Nursery was a woman with an ankle-length dress, a shawl over her shoulders. She clutched the shawl and rocked from side to side, speaking the inarticulate sounds rather than humming.</p>
<p>Beside her was Snag. He was heavyset. Two hundred and fifty pounds, at least, possibly three hundred pounds, and he wasn’t quite six feet tall. That mass was made even bulkier by his coat, which was fastened closed, draping down to his ankles, where his boots were. The sleeves had been modified to be longer, fitting the arms, which reached to the floor.</p>
<p>It was my first chance at seeing his face, though. He had long black hair and a thick beard, both in the loose heavy-metal take. His mask looked like he’d taken handfuls of black clay and layered it over the skin his hair and beard didn’t cover. The mask created a kind of neanderthal brow with a permanent glare built into it; the circles under his eyes were so dark it was hard to tell exactly where the eyeholes of the black clay mask started. It might have been thick rubber, melted to be in the crude shape needed, the texture left unrefined.</p>
<p>Nursery barely flinched as the door opened. Fume Hood stuck her head and arm out, and she fired three projectiles. One hit the slash of white paint that separated Nursery’s realm from the door, exploding into a cloud of gas. Two hit near where Nursery and Snag were, going to pieces instead of exploding or producing gas.</p>
<p>The gas from the first shot expanded to fill the space between Nursery’s pocket world and the door at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>“Speed it up,” Snag said.</p>
<p>Nursery turned his way. She wore a cloth mask with holes cut out for the eyes. The cloth had a floral print and was bound close to her neck with a series of chokers. She continued to mumble and hum, but she’d stopped rocking in place.</p>
<p>“Come on now,” Snag growled. “We’re expecting trouble.”</p>
<p>The humming stopped. The music box chimes that seemed to be plucking and pealing from the light fixtures and behind the walls grew noticeably quieter.</p>
<p>“Every time I have to stop to respond to you, Snag, it slows us down. Be a good boy and be patient, trust us. We’re making progress, even if you can’t see it.”</p>
<p>“If we get caught between the new player and Bad Apple’s team&mdash;”</p>
<p>Nursery let go of her shawl to reach out, placing her hand flat on Snag’s face, covering eyes, nose and mouth. He pulled back, and I ducked back behind the corner, so he wouldn’t catch a glimpse of me.</p>
<p>“Hush,” she said. “We’re safe even if that happens. This is my sanctuary.”</p>
<p>“I will bite you if you touch my face again.”</p>
<p>“You’re not as scary as you pretend to be, Snag. I know scary. You’re just a man that’s dressing up,” Nursery said. She sounded gentle, calm even after being threatened.</p>
<p>“Try me.”</p>
<p>“Please, hush,” she said. “Let me do my work.”</p>
<p>“If you take any longer, I’m going to push for plan B.”</p>
<p>Nursery resumed humming.</p>
<p>No more feedback from Crystalclear. The group at the end of the hall weren’t doing much of anything.</p>
<p>More to the point, I was rather concerned that the area of the building I was in didn’t entirely map to the layout of the building that I’d seen from the outside. There was just a little too much room to either side of Nursery and Snag.</p>
<p>“Tell me the details,” Snag said, his voice growl-like even when he wasn’t threatening Nursery. He’d walked a distance away from her and toward me.</p>
<p>A pause, long. Snag picked up a child’s plush and threw it down the hall, bowling over a stack of thin hardcover books.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s taking plenty of time. So is Nursery,” he said. “What’s Kingdom’s status?”</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“At this stage I’d settle for plan B,” he said. “I’d pay for the property damage.”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“They’re trying to buy time and it’s working. Tell Blindside to hurry up.”</p>
<p>Blindside.</p>
<p>I stood with my back to the wall, listening in. Crystalclear hadn’t communicated, but I wasn’t sure he could. Fume Hood and Tempera weren’t doing much but holding the fort and delaying.</p>
<p>Nursery continued humming, but she piqued the last hum with an inquisitive note.</p>
<p>“Blindside faked being out. Should arrive soon. We’ve got some details on our mystery guest. Dressed like one of the troopers I stashed in the room back there. Untouchable but still wary of being hit. Emotion control.”</p>
<p>The humming stopped.</p>
<p>I expected Snag to complain. He didn’t.</p>
<p>I chanced a look around the corner.</p>
<p>Nursery had turned around. She faced me. Snag was gone.</p>
<p>I stepped out of cover, one hand on my gun, glancing around to see where Snag had disappeared to.</p>
<p>I wasn’t supposed to fight a shaker in her domain. But here she was, standing with her hands clasped in front of her, defenseless. She was also the only thing standing between me and the room where Fume Hood was.</p>
<p>“Let me through,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” she said.</p>
<p>I pushed out my aura, as hard as I could manage.</p>
<p>She didn’t flinch. It didn’t reach her.</p>
<p>That was what this was. Her sanctuary was a protection from shaker effects. She overrode everything by transplanting this screwed up baby decor into the area.</p>
<p>I wondered if I could hit her. I looked around for Snag and didn’t see him.</p>
<p>“Wake up,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Wake up, sweetie.”</p>
<p>The crib, a little red wagon with blankets heaped over it, and a carriage nearby jumped, rattling as if something had moved within.</p>
<p>I heard wet sounds. Throughout the hazy altered space, the meaty squelching started to overtake the background hums.</p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks.</p>
<p>Things moved beneath the blankets. She still hadn’t budged.</p>
<p>I turned around and ran.</p>
<p>Fuck this.</p>
<p>I got away as fast as my legs would take me. I hit the wall at the end of the hallway and stopped myself with my hands rather than slow down with my legs. I turned right and headed away, past more cribs, more strollers, baby seats and bouncy chairs, all draped in their blankets of varying types and quality. Some tipped over from the violence of the agitation.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, whatever it was she was doing, I wasn’t going to mess with it.</p>
<p>There had to be other ways.</p>
<p>I escaped the area of Nursery’s shaker effect, stepping back into ordinary community center hallway. I was in the opposite corner of the second floor from where I’d started.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, I could see the shadows cast by Lord of Loss’ branches. Was it worth chancing flying outside, then flying into the room where Fume Hood was, when Lord of Loss could try hitting me or grabbing me?</p>
<p>There was another stairwell at the end of the hall&mdash; one I hadn’t sealed.</p>
<p>The door opposite it had something hanging on it. A gauntlet with clawed fingertips, the ‘arm’ something electronic. The claw’s tips were embedded in the wood of doorframe and door both.</p>
<p>“Hello?” I called out. I glanced back to make sure Nursery and Snag hadn’t followed me.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch the door!” was the rushed response.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Patrol from the high school, community center staff,” the voice from the other side said. “Don’t touch the door. There’s a bomb!”</p>
<p>“I see it,” I said.</p>
<p>“They said they’d disable it when they left. You said to stay safe, so we cooperated and let them lock us in.”</p>
<p>“That’s&mdash; that’s good,” I said. My heart was still pounding from Nursery’s thing. I was pretty sure Blindside wasn’t around, because my senses weren’t being affected. “We’ll get this figured out.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how. They had a shaker power to override Tempera and Fume Hood. Potentially Crystalclear and Longscratch as well, depending. They had Lord of Loss sequestering the outside and they had Nursery taking over the inside.</p>
<p>In the same moment I turned my thoughts to Snag and his disappearance, two mechanical arms stabbed out of the nearest wall as if the wall was paper. One hand caught me around the neck. The other across the face. I was slammed into the window, hard enough to shatter it and take out my forcefield. Glass tinkled onto my head, into my hair, and all around me.</p>
<p>Before I could get my bearings, he hauled me into the wall. My head cracked into the drywall and I felt it break with the impact. His hand gripped my mouth and the length of his long forearm caught me around the throat.</p>
<p>I put my hands on his arms, and I felt the whir as machinery kicked into life.</p>
<p>As someone with the ability to control emotions, I was supposed to be harder to read and affect. It was why I’d deflected Crystalclear earlier.</p>
<p>It was why Dean and I had gotten along. Even why we’d been possible.</p>
<p>Maybe that resistance came into play. Maybe it turned Snag’s power from an emotional uppercut to a mere slap. Negative emotions poured into me like liquid from a syringe.</p>
<p>But a slap on an open wound could be enough to bring someone to their knees. The walls came tumbling down, the memories flooding in, and my last coherent, present thought was that I hoped I wouldn’t maim or kill anyone in the meantime.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap15">Daybreak &mdash; 1.6</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Snag’s power hurt, and it hurt in a way that had nothing to do with shedding blood or breaking bones. Emotion. My body still reacted, my heart rate picking up, breathing choked, adrenaline churning, hormones shifting. My thoughts were scattered, thrusting me into a state where I could either only <em>reel</em> or I could grope for a position in familiar ground.</p>
<p>I didn’t want familiar.</p>
<p>Reeling meant trying not to think, letting it wash over me and through me, and not letting my thoughts go where the feelings pointed. It meant I still had a metal gauntlet on my face and a metal arm pulled against my throat, and I was handling the situation with instinct. Fight or flight.</p>
<p><em>Fight&mdash;</em></p>
<p>No. I only barely stopped myself. I’d kill him if I fought.</p>
<p><em>Fly then.</em></p>
<p>I pushed out with my aura, hard. The flip side of my observation moments ago was true. I was supposed to be resistant to hits to my emotions because I could deliver those hits myself. Snag would be resistant to my aura for similar reasons.</p>
<p>He still let go, arms slipping back through the wall. I had a moment where I thought about grabbing one of his wrists as it passed me, and I hesitated a moment too long.</p>
<p>I backed away, staggering until I bumped into the window next to the broken one. My chest hurt as if I’d had my heart ripped out, and thoughts of Dean flickered through my head. It was a continuation of my thoughts from earlier, one sample in a long, long series of thoughts I hadn’t let myself finish over the past few months and years that the surge of emotion was now filling in and pushing to the surface.</p>
<p>It was loss, if I had to put a name to it. Nothing to do with the man on the roof.</p>
<p>It was me in the hospital, with Auntie Sarah and Crystal, not knowing what to say because Uncle Neil and Eric had just died. Crystal had been hurt too, and the place had been so busy and crowded that we’d gathered in the small curtained enclosure where her hospital bed was. My mom had been gone, trying to get news on my dad’s situation, and my sister&mdash;</p>
<p>It was going from that, the horrible feeling of helplessness and hopelessness, to hearing the curtain move. I’d known it wasn’t my mom &mdash; she’d left only a minute ago. It was as if someone had taken a want, desire, even <em>a need</em> equal to what I’d experienced in my childhood and early teens, when I’d wanted to be a hero, when I’d written letters to Santa and wished it during every birthday candle extinguishing and for every shooting star I’d seen from when I was four to when I was fourteen, if someone had gathered all of that feeling and compressed it into a single, concentrated moment of wanting it to be Dean coming into the enclosure to give me a hug. And then not getting what I wanted.</p>
<p>The PRT staff member had come in to let me know Gallant had wanted to see me while there was still time. Dean had.</p>
<p>Heart ripped out of my chest, just like that, just like this feeling here. Losses, losses, fucking <em>losses</em>. That ambiguous fucking word they’d used when they’d delivered the mass report. Not deaths, not the ‘downs’ that were injured just enough they were out of the fight, just <em>losses</em> because they’d needed to be brief with the list of names so long. Dean’s name had been on that list.</p>
<p><em>Where?</em> It had taken me three tries to get the word out. They’d told me where, but I hadn’t traveled a straight line to get there. I’d zig-zagged, from doctor to nurse to PRT staff. I’d asked people who had no cause or reason to know, tried describing her. Asking, asking. Pleading.</p>
<p>Where was she? Had they seen her? Where was the last place anyone saw her? I need&mdash;</p>
<p>Where? I shook my head, trying to rattle my brain and get centered in the present. Where was Snag? He’d disappeared into the next room. I stepped forward, feeling unwieldy, and thrust my hand at the door, taking it off of the hinges, damaging the door’s frame. Empty room. Nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>My hand shook from the emotion, extended out in front of me. I clenched it into a fist.</p>
<p>She’d been nowhere to be found too.</p>
<p>I’d arrived alone, no help to offer. Too late to say anything or hear anything from him. I’d choked on my words when it came to saying something to his parents. There’d been this feeling like I couldn’t react the way I’d wanted and needed to, because his parents were there and they were somehow maintaining their composure. Upset, yes, but they were wealthy and dignified enough they would do their crying in private. They had weathered their losses years before and it had been the same then, according to Dean. Now it was on Dean’s behalf.</p>
<p>What options did that leave me? Break down into hysterical sobbing and act like I was hurting more than his own family was? It might have been dismissed as the drama of a teenager and I hadn’t wanted that to be the final note on Dean and me, in their eyes, in the eyes of bystanders.</p>
<p>Like I imagined anyone in a relationship did, I’d wondered if we were in love, and then I’d <em>known</em> we were in love, and I’d grown close enough to him to wonder if he was a soulmate, dismissed the term just as easily as it had come up because it was silly and it didn’t matter either way, did it? I’d received my answer on the question as I’d felt a part of me die during those long minutes of me trying and failing to say something to his family.</p>
<p>From that to home. Southwest end of the city, our house mostly untouched by the attack. To dad being ‘impaired’, mom’s word, and mom being business as usual, emphasis on business, because that was how she dealt.</p>
<p>To… a family member acting like they’d been replaced by a fucking pod person from another planet, gradually realizing that replacement had been a long time ago, and it was only <em>now</em> in context and crisis that I’d seen the alien-ness clearly, in the then-present and in retrospect.</p>
<p>Painful, in its own way, to have nobody to turn to. The hurt had been there like a block of ice, melting too slowly when I hadn’t had any warmth to reach out for, not any less cold as the water pooled. Not any <em>less</em> for the time that passed. Just… more ambient.</p>
<p>This was like that. Snag’s emotional effect was temporary. The pain ebbed out, made my fingers feel numb and tingly, made it hard to breathe, and made me feel more physically weak and less coordinated than I should have been.</p>
<p>I stumbled a few steps, and reached out to touch the wall for support as I resumed moving, entering the room Snag had been in when he’d punched his arms through the wall. It was reminiscent of a hotel room, but rustic enough it could have been a bed and breakfast. Two small beds, a bedside table, a desk, and a flatscreen television sitting on a dresser.</p>
<p>He had a mover classification, I was pretty sure. He’d used a trick to jump after the bus. I made sure to look up, to avoid any ambush in case he jumped at me from the space between the top of the door and the ceiling.</p>
<p>The room was empty.</p>
<p>“Snag?” I asked.</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>My emotions were jumping around as I bucked the worst of the effect. I wanted to have him to talk to, to pull me out of the mire of past feelings and into the present. It made for a wild, disturbed kind of familiarity, almost a longing, as distorted emotions tried to find reconciliation with my head. It ended up parsing him as if he was an old friend I was trying to reconnect with. The same kind of weird emotional fixations that made Stockholm syndrome a thing. Cult leaders and abusers used it.</p>
<p>When you had nothing, you groped for anything, even if it was the person who’d brought you to that point.</p>
<p>I’d reached out back then, too. I’d turned to the Wards, because my mom had been the only person doing anything to keep New Wave in motion, the team had been falling apart, and I’d needed <em>something.</em> Because the tests and briefings made me feel closer to Dean, reminded me of the study sessions. Because the first time I saw her after the Endbringer attack, Vista had hugged me, because Dean, and it meant something to me that there was someone else properly upset for him.</p>
<p>“Guys,” I said, loud enough to be heard in the next room.</p>
<p>“Victoria? Are you okay?” the voice was muffled.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to respond. My failure to form words reminded me of talking to Dean’s parents again.</p>
<p>I stopped myself, trying to focus and put myself in the present. I took a deep breath that shook a little on the way in and the way out.</p>
<p>“Step back from the wall,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” was the immediate response. “Don’t touch the bomb.”</p>
<p>“I’m not touching the bomb,” I said. “Get away from the door and the wall to the right of the door.”</p>
<p>Snag had felt secure enough to stick his arms through the wall and not jar the bomb too badly.</p>
<p>I’d take his cue.</p>
<p>I put my arm through the wall, felt my forcefield go down. I heard the exclamations. Once I was sure I was good to move, I dragged it to one side, tearing a hole, felt one of the studs, moved it to the other side, and felt another. About two feet of clearance between the studs.</p>
<p>I saw the faces on the other side. Worried. Angry.</p>
<p>The window shattered. Snag reached through, seizing me by the throat. He swung by one arm outside the building, dragging his other arm through the windows and slats, shattering them with explosive force, as he drove me toward the wall opposite the hole I’d just made.</p>
<p>I still had my forcefield up. He hadn’t grabbed me that hard. Flight and forcefield together helped to stop me in my tracks. Floorboards shattered under me, and a window beside me broke as the force was transferred out.</p>
<p>Seizing his arm, I swung it like a bat, hurling him into the room. I maintained my grip on him as I did it.</p>
<p>He touched the ground with one foot, then changed trajectory. Dust fell from the ceiling as he landed on it, upside-down, his arm still extended my way.</p>
<p>I felt the machinery hum with activity, and tore the hand away, pushing it away from my throat and face. The emotion effect grazed me, minor, but I hadn’t recovered from the last hit.</p>
<p>A small kind of loss, this. The hit didn’t do what the first had, rounding out a memory. It did buzz through other memories. Ones that were more minor, that I’d never put to rest.</p>
<p>Being in the bus stop with my mom. Weird, because it had once been a happy memory. She’d been stitching up a cut on my forehead while I suppressed my forcefield. The rain had been pouring, streaking the graffiti-covered walls of the bus stop. A moment for just my mom and me. She’d paused midway through the first aid to tell me that she was proud of me. We’d got the guy we were after. Then we had talked about how I’d have to change my hair for a short while to hide the stitches. One of my first times officially out in costume.</p>
<p>It was a memory I kept going back to. One I’d brought up several times in the hospital. Bittersweet somehow, and it had become more bitter and less sweet over time.</p>
<p>It <em>bothered</em> me, brought me down just a bit, because it was something unresolved that had weighed on me, because I was already down a ways.</p>
<p>“<em>Stop</em>,” I said. I didn’t sound like myself.</p>
<p>His hands freed, he reached back to his boot with one gauntlet.</p>
<p>He threw a trio of fat shurikens at me. My forcefield blocked them, saw them bounce off, one landing on the bed, two falling to the floor beside me.</p>
<p>I kicked the bed to bring the more solid bedframe to where I could grab it, and rammed the end of the bed at the corner where he was. The shurikens detonated behind me, and on the bed in front of me. Something that wasn’t fire or anything of the sort. Something jumped between them, like electricity but not. Where it touched me, my heart jumped, my mind stumbled, and feelings welled.</p>
<p>All of the doubts, fears, and hesitations inside me magnified, multiplied. It paralyzed me for the moment.</p>
<p>This, at least, was something I’d been trying to get a handle on. Here, my resistance applied.</p>
<p>He’d dropped down to the ground before the bed struck him, landing on both feet, arms spread out, hands planted on the ground. He sprung back using his mover power, landing with one hand and one boot near the ceiling and another hand and boot beneath and on the window as he clung to the wall.</p>
<p>With the damage I’d done to the bed already by using it as a weapon, the swipe I used to get it out of my way destroyed it, only the mattress surviving. I still had to pick my way past a slat.</p>
<p>He seemed surprised that I was already moving. After pausing momentarily in shock, he used the moment of me navigating the wreckage of the bed to spring off to the right, down the hallway.</p>
<p>I passed through the doorway, pursuing, and my head turned against my will. I heard glass break, saw Snag vault through the window he’d broken.</p>
<p>He was nimble, for a guy that big, but it seemed his mover power was responsible for most of it, his mechanical arms only helping with the legwork. He was strong in many respects for what I was gathering was a multi-trigger. Robust tinkerings, what felt like a full-fledged emotion affecting ability, a decent mover power.</p>
<p>My attention was more on the other two further down the hallway. Blindside, I assumed, and a hint of the pink and grey coloring to the carpet that might have been Nursery.</p>
<p>Blindside’s bat tinked against a solid surface as they loitered there.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Snag,” Blindside muttered. “Running off and leaving us with this?”</p>
<p>“He’s a character,” Nursery said.</p>
<p>“You’re a character,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>I could hear wet slurping sounds and I couldn’t see what was making them because Blindside was standing close to Nursery.</p>
<p>“Stop this,” I said. “It doesn’t end anyplace good.”</p>
<p>I didn’t hear the response, because Snag reached up through the floorboards, seized my leg, and hauled me halfway through the floor. I might have gone further, but I braced myself with flight and forcefield.</p>
<p>It left me kneeling with one leg, the other stuck straight out and down through the floor, my hands on the ground in front of me.</p>
<p>I heard Blindside’s running approach.</p>
<p>Bat in hand, probably. I pushed out with my aura, hoping to give them a reason to think twice, buy myself a second.</p>
<p>Lurching to my feet, I brought Snag’s arm up above the ground. I reached down to grab his hand, and then kicked nearer to the elbow.</p>
<p>The mechanical arm broke off. With a bat of my own, I shifted my grip to the wrist rather than the now-limp hand, and held my weapon out, waving the broken end of the arm in Blindside’s general direction.</p>
<p>No blood. I’d broken it off far enough down. That was good.</p>
<p>I was breathing hard, my heart was racing, and old wounds felt fresh again, but I was finding some equilibrium again. I&mdash;</p>
<p>The arm I was holding self-destructed, or the emotional battery within it did. It stayed in one piece and it dashed me to pieces.</p>
<p>Again, the ripped-out heart feeling. Again, the heavy sense of despair. Deeper-seated now, because I hadn’t recovered entirely from either of the other two hits, the big one and the graze.</p>
<p>I saw double, more than double.</p>
<p>Months and years of seeing double. One eye on the computer screen beside me, watching the time, looking for chat notifications. One eye on the television. One eye on the door.</p>
<p>Twenty past two. Fifteen minutes late. I counted the minutes. Twenty one past two.</p>
<p>Twenty two past two. The sound from the television was almost abrasive, made to be attention-getting.</p>
<p>I wanted to say something, protest, and I didn’t have a voice. The computer was in arm’s reach, but it was a herculean effort to get a message out.</p>
<p>The door opening and the wrong person being on the other side. Just like with Dean. It wasn’t the staff member who came on weekdays at two-oh-five when I had visitors. It was someone else, with a face I knew, a name I didn’t, and a gentle voice that was telling me that another patient was throwing a tantrum and the facility was on lockdown, they had contacted my visitors.</p>
<p>My visitors, my family, had decided that because they didn’t know how long the lockdown would be, they would come another day. It was a long trip.</p>
<p>I reached for the laptop, started to type out my message for the text-to-speech speaker, using keys that were oversized and spaced out, with screwholes in the middle of each key for knobs and joysticks to be screwed in for when other patients had their turn. It was supposed to double as physical therapy for me, coordinating myself, making the effort to reach and reposition.</p>
<p>The staff member had apologized, then turned to go notify other patients, closing the door behind her. I’d tried to vocalize and of course I’d failed. It was too long and byzantine a way from lung to mouth.</p>
<p>The message had been left unfinished on my screen, only a few words of what I’d wanted to say. Even completed, the statement wouldn’t have meant anything to the staff member, and they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. All I’d wanted to express was that my family had missed the last two visiting days as well.</p>
<p>My eye had found the clock on the laptop, noted the ‘F’. Friday.</p>
<p>One eye on the clock, watching the minutes. One eye on the television. One eye on the F, counting the days to Monday. One eye for the email icon on the computer screen, waiting for the apology email that would come. When it did, I would check the time, comparing it to other apology emails, to try and figure out if they were getting further apart, <em>less.</em> To see if they would stop entirely, a prelude to the visits ceasing altogether, because it was easier to forget me than to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Something inside of me had broken at that. I’d known it would cost me privileges. Maybe even visits. I’d known it would hamper or hurt other patients and staff across the hospital. Ones who didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p>But I had nothing else.</p>
<p>I’d pushed out with my aura, as hard as I could, as far as I could.</p>
<p>I pushed out with my aura, as hard as I could, as far as I could.</p>
<p>Things had been happening while I was elsewhere. The building shook. The villains were gone.</p>
<p>“Victoria!”</p>
<p>Jasper.</p>
<p>He was with others. I barely recognized them. The heroes in particular took me a second. The kid who looked a little bit flamboyant, hair gelled back, wearing what was almost a crop top, a beast’s upper face with fangs pointing down at his chest, the lower jaw and fangs on the belt, with diagonal slashes worked into either side of both parts of the icon, painted on his abs in a faint color that might have been missed in dimmer light. Tempera with more of the white paint on her, a bit of blood. Fume Hood was using one hand to press a bandage to her shoulder. Crystalclear was missing more than a few chunks from his head. One of his eyes was exposed now, peering from between one chunk that grew from the bridge of his nose and one that grew from his temple, very blue.</p>
<p>They looked frightened of me.</p>
<p>That was what my aura did, really. Another of those contextual emotional things, like the Stockholm syndrome. Awe and admiration if they liked me, fear if they didn’t.</p>
<p>Just fear, here.</p>
<p>“S-stop.”</p>
<p>Not my voice this time. Jasper’s.</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>I trembled as I made myself get back to my feet. I wiped my cheeks where they were wet. My hair was a mess from being thrown around. I used numb fingers to pry at it, undoing the tie.</p>
<p>“Christ,” Mar said.</p>
<p>For the first time, Jasper didn’t shut him up.</p>
<p>The building shook. Daylight reached parts of the indoors it wasn’t supposed to. This would be their plan B. Property damage indeed. Lord of Loss was tearing off the roof.</p>
<p>“We need to go,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>I nodded. I looked back for the hole I’d made. I saw the teenagers in uniform in the trashed room. They’d opened the hole the rest of the way and filed out. Now they stood as far away from me as the room’s boundaries allowed.</p>
<p>They would have seen me throw the bed.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. My voice sounded hollow.</p>
<p>The partial uniform I wore, still without the vest that I’d left outside, dusty blood-spotted, it didn’t fit me anymore. I felt choked by it, because I knew I’d just lost my job.</p>
<p>I led the way down the stairs. I stumbled in one place where a trace of Nursery’s effect made the stair a different shape, carpeted when it shouldn’t have been. Flight helped keep me from sprawling.</p>
<p>“You’re Glory Girl,” Landon said.</p>
<p><em>I’m not</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>“People said you died when the Slaughterhouse Nine attacked Brockton Bay back in twenty-eleven.”</p>
<p>“Landon,” Jasper said. One word.</p>
<p>The people who had been gathered inside were evacuating. Kingdom Come wasn’t making it easy, either. As they reached a safe distance, near where people had been protesting, they were gathering in offset rows, so we would have to move diagonally or zig-zag through their ranks to get past them. A fence.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell what the villains were doing when Blindside was part of the group and they were already distant, but I could turn my head and see a bit of them out of the corner of one eye. They were backing up, moving away without actually fleeing the scene. Nursery was creating her effect.</p>
<p>The kids I’d brought with me were backing away, putting themselves a distance away from us.</p>
<p>I looked up for the branches overhead and I didn’t see them.</p>
<p>“Watch out for Lord of Loss,” Tempera said, following my line of sight.</p>
<p>Where was he?</p>
<p>“He’s up there,” Crystalclear said. “He’s changing. Centaur?”</p>
<p>“That’s his combat form,” I said. I still didn’t sound like myself. “One of them. It’s mobile.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep the others busy,” Longscratch said. He swiped one of the weapons he held, the buckler with the three swords mounted on the back, and three deep furrows appeared on the ground, stretching out beneath the feet of the crowd.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>Longscratch flickered, appearing momentarily at two of the points on the far side of the crowd where the furrows ended, before finalizing at the third.</p>
<p>“Help him,” she told Crystalclear, touching his shoulder, leaving white fingerprints. “Fume Hood, stay close. They’re still targeting you.”</p>
<p>Tempera moved her hand, and deposited what looked like fifty gallons of the white paint with black edges on the street. We spread out as it appeared. She moved her fingers, and it spread out.</p>
<p>“Tempe!” Crystalclear shouted. He extended one hand out to the side, pointing.</p>
<p>The paint moved, a tidal wave, leaving a streak where it went.</p>
<p>I chased it.</p>
<p>Lord of Loss leaped from the rooftop. Ten feet tall, a centaur in vague shape only. His lower body looked more rhino-like, though the legs were longer, and he was plated in those same straps that looked like twists of smoke frozen in place, or wispy bands of metal that peeled away from him at the end. He carried a heavy shield on one side, cut in a way that let its bottom left edge rest against the shoulder of his foreleg when he held it tilted forward, and he carried a heavy lance in the other hand.</p>
<p>His face was a helmet, the slits for the eyes and lower face were closed up, so the face was only a series of ridges where bands met and poked out, Y-shaped. His hair was a mane of bands left to flow like smoke.</p>
<p>He landed in the streak of Tempera’s paint, and he lost traction, falling to one side.</p>
<p>The paint rose up and over him, then solidified. He shattered it, lurched to his feet. The paint liquified and rose up and over his legs, and he shattered it again.</p>
<p>Was it more easily than he’d shattered it the first time?</p>
<p>Actions he repeated were supposed to be stronger.</p>
<p>To give Tempera a hand, I threw myself forward at Lord of Loss. Flight, forcefield up. He twisted around and raised the shield, blocking me. I still hit him hard enough to cost him footing. Paint covered him, hardened.</p>
<p>He broke the paint, swung his lance around, hitting me with the broad side.</p>
<p>Forcefield down, impact dampened but not entirely broken. I hit the ground and it hurt.</p>
<p>He broke through the paint yet again, found his feet, hit me again, this time while my feet were planted on the ground. My forcefield came back up just in time to be broken again.</p>
<p>Yeah, that hit had been harder.</p>
<p>Fume Hood shot him, hit him in the face. The paint crawled up to his upper body and joints, hardened there, trying to limit his movement, and he broke it again.</p>
<p>He laughed. Then he hit me again. I deflected the hit, swatting at his lance with one hand.</p>
<p>He was advancing, pressing closer to Fume Hood, and as much as I retreated, as much as I was sure Fume Hood was backing up, he had longer legs.</p>
<p>When he hit me yet again, pavement cracked beneath me, around my feet, the forcefield pushing the impact out and around me. I almost lost my step backing away, with the cracked ground.</p>
<p>Each hit stronger than the last by a significant margin.</p>
<p>This was the point I was supposed to throw my hands up and surrender, or get out of the way. If he decided to hit me more frequently, or if he lurched forward and kicked me with one of those feet of his after swatting me with his lance&mdash;</p>
<p>Crystalclear had turned around, was using his blasts on Lord of Loss now.</p>
<p>Loss, losses, losses, losses.</p>
<p>I threw myself forward, flying, seizing him by one leg, twisting, trying to knock him over.</p>
<p>I got him off balance, and then he hit me. Only a moment of me holding onto him kept me from getting smacked into the ground with no forcefield. I fell to the ground and scrambled out of the way of his legs.</p>
<p>I waited until my forcefield was back, then threw myself at him, bowling him over. I tore at strips, peeling away at him.</p>
<p>In the background, Kingdom Come had abandoned his control over the crowd. They woke as if from a deep sleep, and they seemed surprised by what was happening around them. They fled. Away from the brutes fighting, away from the chaos and the damaged building.</p>
<p>He elbowed me. It took him long enough to rise to his feet again that I was able to get in front of him again.</p>
<p>I could do this.</p>
<p>I <em>needed</em> to do this.</p>
<p>It&mdash;</p>
<p>It wasn’t my day to get what I wanted. I barely registered the sound. A crack, coinciding with the noise of the crowd. Lord of Loss went still.</p>
<p>My back had been turned, so I hadn’t been in a position to see it.</p>
<p>One bullet, from somewhere nearby. Fume Hood on the ground, Tempera beside her.</p>
<p>It wasn’t my day to get what I wanted.</p>
<p>I’d frozen. A lot of people had.</p>
<p>“Go to her,” Lord of Loss said. “Help. I’ll let you go if you let us go.”</p>
<p>Numb, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Let people know it wasn’t us. This wasn’t our plan,” he said, behind me.</p>
<p>I flew as much as I walked, and dropped to my knees at Fume Hood’s side. I put my forcefield up, tried to position myself where I could be a wall for her.</p>
<p>“Put your hands here,” Tempera told me.</p>
<p>I did, pressing down on the stomach wound. Blood pooled out, covering the backs of my hands.</p>
<p>The crowd had gone still. There was a murmuring, and people were drawing closer to watch and to see.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of Vikare.</p>
<p>In the background, Longscratch and Crystalclear had already apprehended the suspect. A protester that had been in a building nearby. Hunting rifle. The villains were leaving.</p>
<p>“Not&mdash;” Fume Hood grunted.</p>
<p>“Not?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not a good day,” she muttered, through gasps.</p>
<p>“No,” I agreed. Very much agreed.</p>
<p>Landon had come closer, and was helping by getting the first aid kit out. Tempera took the components.</p>
<p>“Not a good day for any of us,” Tempera said, giving the crowd a glance.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap16">Daybreak &mdash; 1.7</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>The sun was just starting to set when the police were wrapping up with us. They’d had to arrive first, of course, the ones who had been on the scene were compromised, victims as much as anything.</p>
<p>Nobody Kingdom Come had affected remembered much of anything. It was as though they’d fallen asleep &mdash; they remembered losing awareness, some reported briefly coming to in the middle of things as the building had shook or they had been knocked around, and they hadn’t really processed or understood much of those glimmers.</p>
<p>A few had reported me as a recurring image.</p>
<p>There was some concern that Kingdom Come might have absconded with someone or that not everyone that had been in the crowd was accounted for, but from what I could tell, it had been an all or nothing thing. People remembered coming to, many of them dangerously close to a superhero fight in progress, but the recollections were hazy.</p>
<p>I sat on the sidewalk near the front door of the community center, aware that it was very late in the day. The sky was orange-yellow now, with darkness on the eastern horizon. The thickest parts of the clouds overhead were cast in shadow, zig-zags of darkness through the amber.</p>
<p>The heat of the day was subsiding, helped by the cloud cover. Dust and sweat had left my arms mottled with grime and tracks where sweat had wiped it away. I’d washed my hands after helping Fume Hood, and I’d realized I hadn’t gotten all of Tempera’s paint and the blood on the backs of my hands. I was painfully conscious of the sweat, grime and blood, yet I couldn’t bring myself to go wash up because that would require attention to it.</p>
<p>Paradoxical, I was well aware.</p>
<p>I turned my attention back to the kids. Making sure they were okay. At some point where I had been lost in thought, Gilpatrick had showed up. I watched until he glanced my way. He raised a hand, and I raised mine. Then he turned his attention back to the teenagers. As it should be.</p>
<p>I’d figured I would be working late. I’d just thought it would be paperwork and talking to the students. I’d really liked that part. It was fascinating stuff when it wasn’t so close to home.</p>
<p>I could relax some, seeing Gilpatrick. Not because it meant great things, but because it meant I didn’t have to think about finding Gil after, getting the details, putting off hearing the news or delivering the essential details.</p>
<p>I put my hands behind me where I wouldn’t see the blood or the places where the paint had settled into the cracks, oil-black, and I leaned back, eyes closed, trying to focus on the voices and the sounds, on the breezy wind and the ambient warmth.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Gilpatrick said. He’d approached me.</p>
<p>I kept my eyes closed. I said, “Are the students okay? The others?”</p>
<p>“They’re fine. Some have parents here, I’ve got a bus coming for the others. Psychologically, emotionally, I don’t know. It was scary and it was hard to know what was happening. The staff of the community center are obviously upset about the building, but that’s not on us.”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>Gilpatrick wasn’t wearing his vest. A sleeveless undershirt tucked into black pants, a sweatshirt slung over one shoulder. Bald, bushy eyebrows, hairy, hairy arms.</p>
<p>“Jasper filled me in on most of it,” he said. “He’s reliable when it counts, it seems.”</p>
<p>“He’s a good guy,” I agreed. “There’s a reason I wanted him with me.”</p>
<p>“I get it now, I think.”</p>
<p>“If you want this project to be a positive thing, at least at our school, you’ll want more Jaspers. You wanted a verdict on the kids you sent with me? I wouldn’t put them in leadership roles. Not if there are going to be capes on scene. What I heard and saw wasn’t very positive, and if there were any who disagreed, they didn’t feel confident enough to say it out loud.”</p>
<p>Gilpatrick ran his hand over the skin of his head, not giving me a response.</p>
<p>My arms were tired from propping myself up. I leaned forward instead.</p>
<p>“Alright. Thanks. Not good to hear, but I appreciate it,” he said. “I’ll take that under serious advisement.”</p>
<p>“They follow orders, at least.”</p>
<p>“I was really hoping to have more hands to help out,” he said. “Really unfortunate.”</p>
<p>Some parents were joining students who were talking to the police. I watched them. Parent and child side by side, parents concerned as they listened, getting the details at the same time the officers were.</p>
<p>“I am sorry this happened,” Gilpatrick said. “I meant it when I said it. I mean it now.”</p>
<p>“I gave my point-by-point retelling of events to the police,” I said. I stared at my hands. “Including the part where I was hit by a few emotion-affecting attacks. It’ll take some of the responsibility off your shoulders, if anyone asks.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that important,” he said. “Well, it’s important, obviously, thank you, but I don’t want to dwell on that. If people make an issue out of it, I’ll handle it. I knew what I was doing when I brought you on board. That’s not what I want to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“I stuck around,” I said. “To be something like a guardian for the students who were acting as witnesses, making sure they weren’t pressed too hard or made uncomfortable. I stopped when I realized being there was making some things harder, because they didn’t like being around me, or that it looked like I was trying to protect myself by inserting myself into things and influencing their testimony.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Gilpatrick said.</p>
<p>“I backed off, Jasper and Landon took my cues, I think.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.”</p>
<p>I thought that’d be the time he followed the thread of the conversation and got around to saying what he needed to say. He didn’t.</p>
<p>There was a break in the convo. More cars were pulling into spaces along either side of the ‘square’ of grass, sidewalk, and fountain in front of the community center. Some more parents.</p>
<p>“Did they mention Fume Hood?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Only that she was taken to the hospital and all signs were good when she left. Tempera was staying close to her. Something to do with paint?”</p>
<p>No news then. “Tempera stopped the worst of the blood loss. She poured paint in the wound, shaped it, and solidified it. We might have lost Fume Hood in another way, though. We might not keep her as a hero after this.”</p>
<p>“Did she say that?”</p>
<p>“There was a brief twilight between when the pain meds kicked in and when the meds knocked her out,” I said. I moved my fingers, felt how unlike skin the backs of my hands felt, stiff with the stuff I hadn’t managed to wash off. I’d rushed, because I’d wanted to get back to keeping an eye on the students from the patrol group.</p>
<p>“Are you going to finish that thought?” Gilpatrick asked, his voice soft.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. “Um. We chatted. She said she was staying with a family member already, so she’d have someone to look after her if she needed it.”</p>
<p>Thinking about family pulled my thoughts in a few different directions. I could have tried picking a safer one, but I wasn’t sure I was that on the ball, being as tired and discouraged as I was.</p>
<p>I went on, “Her brother cut ties with her when she went villain. She was living in that area where all the building foundations were screwed up because they were rushed, and everyone had to leave the homes they’d just settled in, reached out to her brother, and she’s been staying with him, reconnecting. It might give me some hope for her, having that positive influence, but she sounded pretty cynical about it all when we had the conversation right after meeting, before everything happened.”</p>
<p>“Cynicism is understandable, to a degree. That’s where she’s at. Where are you at, Victoria?”</p>
<p>“Similar to Fume Hood, really. I wasn’t evicted because of rushed apartment construction, but I’ve been staying with my dad because it means we each pay half the rent, and I want to keep my options open with things being what they are.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t talking about living accommodations,” Gilpatrick said. “Your head, your heart. Are there any lingering effects from the emotion effect?”</p>
<p>“For the last two years,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Sorry? I didn’t catch that,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s gone. It really sucked while it was in effect, but it’s gone. Right now I’m in that heavyhearted, almost-blameless-but-guilty ‘morning after’ phase, where I’m reflecting on everything I did when I was under the influence,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know that well enough. I’ve been hit a few times by those, back when I was a squaddie and squad leader. And by you, once.”</p>
<p>“You asked me to,” I pointed out, looking up at Gilpatrick, “and this was a bad one. Snag? I read about a thing online, keeping tabs on who was out there. I’m pretty sure he’s part of a new multitrigger cluster. It might have been amplified by the tinkering, if it wasn’t, then something else was in play. That didn’t hit me like it was a minor or secondary power.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he said.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a bad guy. I wanted to be angry but I couldn’t justify it.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry it happened like this,” he said. “It wasn’t supposed to be anything like this. I thought it’d get a bit nasty with the civilian protesters but I didn’t think it’d be anything like this. Not the capes, not the gunshot at the end.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t either.</p>
<p>“Jasper said you guessed why I sent those students with you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I climbed to my feet.</p>
<p>“I’m especially sorry for that,” he said. “If it was up to me, I wouldn’t have ever tested you like that. It wasn’t wholly up to me.”</p>
<p>“Who?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Everyone,” he said. “No-one. It’s complicated. Wardens and the hero teams are being pressured to be mindful of who is out there, touching base, and they reached out to some of the other patrol groups with concerns. They wanted to coordinate, so teenagers wouldn’t be out interviewing or exposing themselves to anyone dangerous. School got to talking, and they got into CYA mode.”</p>
<p>“Cover your ass,” I said.</p>
<p>“They wanted to be able to say that they’d made a reasonable effort to check that the parahumans the students were exposed to were reasonable and safe, in case anything happened down the line. I could have kept quiet about you, but…”</p>
<p>He trailed off.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have asked you to,” I said.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t get the impression you wanted me to, either. You weren’t being secretive. I don’t want to operate that way, either.”</p>
<p>“No. I wouldn’t want you to,” I said.</p>
<p>“You know I can’t keep you on the staff,” he said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>There it was.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been super attached to the job, but… fuck.</p>
<p>“Using power on kids, the contention about possible conflict of interest, undue influence, danger. I think things will stay at that, I don’t think it’ll follow you.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“There’s a dim chance of a student claiming emotional distress because of your aura and pursuing things in court, I’ve already talked to one officer to get them on board and we’ll get something in writing. I’ll vouch for you and for the events as Jasper described them, one hundred percent, if you end up needing someone to stand for you. None of this was you.”</p>
<p>“Courts are a million years behind as it stands, and getting further behind every day we don’t have an established system of government,” I said. “By the time things get that far it’ll be forgotten.”</p>
<p>“That is a factor,” Gilpatrick said.</p>
<p>I wasn’t worried about that side of things. I was hurt, but I wasn’t worried.</p>
<p>“Do you need a hand getting things cleared out of the office?” he asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. I didn’t want to think about that.</p>
<p>“Can&mdash;” I started. I cleared my throat. “Can I get back to you on that? I’ve&mdash; I guess I’ve got a family thing I should go to.”</p>
<p>“For sure,” he said. “Anytime outside of usual school or work hours.”</p>
<p>I might have flinched in a way that he saw, hearing that. I knew why he’d said it, but it still sucked to hear.</p>
<p>I started to walk away.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Any favor you need, reference letter, intel, if you need Jasper or some other trustworthy faces in uniform to lend a hand with something…”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, my voice lighter and more cheerful than I felt. “I’ll be in touch.”</p>
<p>I took off.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>There was something very <em>human</em> about the desire to gather around a fire. Power rationing meant every household had only a certain amount, more if there were more people in the house. Conversely, there was a lot of cheap firewood. Streetlights flickered on, and many house lights went off. In back yards there were three other families on the city block that were gathering around fire pits. Two of the families were playing different kinds of music, but it wasn’t too discordant. There were trees in each yard, front and back, and that helped to dampen the sound.</p>
<p>The entire street smelled like burning charcoal, and the light from the streetlights was just a little bit hazy with the ambient smoke.</p>
<p>It was a nice neighborhood, even if it had what I felt was the artificial quality. Houses with character, sufficiently different from one another in style and architecture, but still so new that they looked more like movie sets than lived-in places. Time and clutter would wear at those crisp edges. Paint and attention would turn fences of new wood with the occasional edge still frayed from the saw’s touch into something more personal.</p>
<p>This was the flip side to the hostility and the street-wide gap between protester and community center. Boyfriend and girlfriend sat on an outdoor love seat together, arms around each other, bathed in fire’s warmth. Friends sat and talked, beers in hand. Kids in another yard played with their dog.</p>
<p>With the path I’d taken, I reached the backyard first. The driveway was wider than it was long, crushed gravel, with room for multiple vehicles, and a fence stretched from the house at one corner to the garage at the other. My mom had invited neighbors, so it was a thing, even if things had reached a more relaxed point.</p>
<p>My dad sat on one of the lawn chairs, fire pit in front of him with the fire having burned down to just glowing coals. The barbecue was to his right, lid open, tiny bits of meat clinging to the grill.</p>
<p>He was forty-two but looked younger. The fact that he was as fit as he was played into it&mdash; only the white in his beard stubble really gave it away. His hair, too, was short. He was the only one who hadn’t put a sweatshirt or jacket on, owing to the proximity of the two heat sources&mdash; he was wearing a t-shirt that was form-fitting in a way that showed off his muscles. Pretty darn gross, given he was a dad, <em>my</em> dad, and he was supposed to dress his age. I would have insisted on clothes that hid any sign of muscle at all, really, had I been given a say.</p>
<p>He looked relaxed though. As relaxed as I’d seen him in a while, really, and I’d seen him passed out on the couch back at the apartment.</p>
<p>I was aware that my mom had seated herself so that two neighbors sat between her and my dad. Where my dad had dressed in a t-shirt and sports pants for the occasion, she had dressed up. Just a bit of lipstick, her hair short and styled, a ruffly sort of white blouse and pencil skirt. She’d kicked off her shoes earlier in the evening, leaving them beneath her chair.</p>
<p>I was aware of the distinction in how they’d dressed, too. In another time, before <em>everything</em>, there would have been more… connection, I supposed. Each influencing the other, until they matched more.</p>
<p>She was smiling. She folded one knee over the other, then a moment later was undoing the position, both feet on the porch again as she leaned forward, laughing at something someone had said.</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>The lights were on inside the house, too. The door was open, and people were scattered through the space between the stairs down to the porch, the back hallway, and the kitchen on the other side of the hallway. The room to the left of the hallway was dark. The neighbors kids, I presumed, teens to twenty-somethings. I saw a glimpse of Crystal stepping into the unlit room, tried to catch her eye with a raised hand as she looked toward the window, and failed.</p>
<p>I did get the attention of someone sitting next to my mom, though. She touched my mom’s arm and pointed.</p>
<p>I remained where I was, arms folded on the top of the wooden-slat fence, chin on my hands, while my mom approached.</p>
<p>“You’re hurt,” she said, touching my arm, where the road rash was.</p>
<p>“Scuffed up.”</p>
<p>“Did you get the other guy?” she asked. She reached out and touched my hair, fixing it by moving strands to one side.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “But there were five of them.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about it? I’m interested.”</p>
<p>“Not really,” I said. “Today&mdash;”</p>
<p>My breath caught.</p>
<p>“&mdash;Kind of not a good day,” I said.</p>
<p>I saw her expression change, even though the light source was behind her.</p>
<p>“What?” I asked. “Don’t tell me you didn’t save me the dessert you promised. Looking forward to that is pretty much the only thing keeping me going right now.”</p>
<p>She smiled, touching my cheek, before kissing me on the forehead. “I saved you dessert with extras to take home, in case you want pie or pastries for breakfast tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done your duty then,” I said, with mock seriousness.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve failed a mission,” she said, in the same tone. She put her hand on the side of my head. “You missed Uncle Mike, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“Oh shoot,” I said. “I barely remember him. How is he?”</p>
<p>“He’s Uncle Mike. He brought his wife and your cousins, and I haven’t child-proofed at all. It was… something, in the brief time he was here. A whirlwind of chaos and emotion, and then he was gone.”</p>
<p>“Ah, too bad,” I said.</p>
<p>In the background, my dad was trying to get my attention. He’d sat up, and didn’t look relaxed anymore. He offered me a small smile. I acknowledged him by lifting one hand up from where it sat on my elbow, in a mini-wave.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming,” my mom said. “I know the family stuff is hard, after everything, but it means so much to me. To everyone.”</p>
<p>“I’m here for the desserts,” I said. I amended it to, “…and a bit for family.”</p>
<p>My mom lightly rapped me on the side of the head before stepping away. “Come on in, then. Meet people, I’ll get your pie.”</p>
<p>As she stepped over to the gate by the garage to unlock it, Crystal stepped out into the backyard, joined by a few others in our age group. She glanced in my direction, saw me, and froze like a deer in the headlights.</p>
<p>Her arms folded, defensive, like something was wrong.</p>
<p>She mouthed words at me, and I couldn’t see her face well enough at a distance to know what the words were, but I could draw conclusions from context.</p>
<p>My dad’s posture, still sitting upright now, both feet planted on the ground.</p>
<p>My mom’s earlier change in expression. Even the wording&mdash;</p>
<p>I backed away from the fence a few steps. My mom froze, the gate only slightly open.</p>
<p>“You invited <em>her</em>,” I said. I wasn’t talking about Crystal.</p>
<p>In reaction to that, my mother didn’t look confused, she didn’t negate. She looked toward the house, to see what I’d seen that had clued me in.</p>
<p>Whirlwind of fucking chaos and emotion indeed.</p>
<p>“You invited her,” I said, again. More emotional this time. “She’s in the house?”</p>
<p>My mother rallied, composing herself. <em>Now</em> she looked confused. “I told you I invited <em>everyone</em>.”</p>
<p>“She’s actually in the house,” I said.</p>
<p>I backed away again, and my mother threw the gate open, taking several steps on the driveway, stepping on crushed gravel with bare feet.</p>
<p>I raised my hand, indicating for her to stop. She continued forward.</p>
<p>I threw my aura out, one push.</p>
<p>My mother stopped. Crystal stopped in her tracks, already at the fence. People rose from their seats.</p>
<p>“I thought you knew,” she said. “I very clearly said <em>everyone</em>. It was supposed to be a family reunion with everyone getting together again for the first time in… in a really long time.”</p>
<p>“You’re a lawyer,” I said. “You’re too clever with wording to be that fucking stupid.”</p>
<p>“Please,” she said, with a tone like she was the one who needed to exercise patience and restraint here. “Let’s keep things civil.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t even look at her. I trembled as my eyes dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“I’ve made mistakes, as your sister has,” my mother said. “She’s been doing so well. I want to make up for past wrongs and be a mother to both of you, like I should have been from the beginning.”</p>
<p>I looked up, staring at her.</p>
<p>The lipstick, the composed outfit, the words, the <em>everything</em> about this all seemed so false now, so forced. I didn’t even recognize her.</p>
<p>“You’re kind of fucking it up,” I said, in the kind of whisper that was the only tone I could manage that wasn’t outright screaming at her. My hands were clenched at their sides.</p>
<p>“That’s not fair.”</p>
<p>“You’re kind of really fucking it up,” I said, in the same strangled whisper.</p>
<p>“Victoria&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You’re fucking it up, <em>mother</em>,” I said. “You’re fucking&mdash; you’re fucking&mdash; did <em>dad</em> play along with this?”</p>
<p>“I told him everyone was coming. You, your sister, Crystal, Uncle Mike. He was surprised, but… pleasantly surprised.”</p>
<p>Dad too, then. There was that heart-wrenched-out feeling again. I screwed my eyes shut, inadvertently squeezing out tears. I was aware her neighbors were seeing.</p>
<p>“Don’t&mdash; don’t get emotional, Victoria,” my mom said. “Please, I didn’t do this to hurt you. The furthest thing from it.”</p>
<p>“You fucked that up too,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“Stop saying that. Please,” my mother said. “It’s the age of second chances, she’s worked very hard to get to this point. I’ve talked to people who worked with her and she’s getting back into her routine in a good way. I want <em>all</em> of us to have a second shot at this, and do it right this time.”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“Leaving things as unresolved as they are is doing more harm than good. To both you and to her.”</p>
<p>“So you thought you’d invite me to dinner and surprise me with her, and you thought there was nothing I could say or do because people are here?”</p>
<p>“You’re putting thoughts and conspiracy in my head,” she said. “I want you to be sisters again. I want us to be a family again.”</p>
<p>“That’s not for you to decide,” I said. “Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t wind yourself up. You’re getting out of breath. Let’s communicate. Please.”</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> getting out of breath. I gulped in a breath of air. “You’re aware I can’t set foot in that house again, right? I’ll see her looming in the shadows, potentially another surprise invite.”</p>
<p>“I want you to find reconciliation, so you wouldn’t feel upset even if she did appear by surprise.”</p>
<p>“I can’t accept any invites from you,” I said. My face started to contort, and I forced it back into something more normal before I lost the ability to see my mother or focus on her altogether. “I can’t grab dessert from you or do anything with you again because <em>she</em> might be there, surprise. I can’t trust you. How can I trust you again?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you feel that way. I did not realize that was where things stood. You’ve been doing so well, and she’s been doing well.”</p>
<p>“How&mdash;” I started. I gulped in another breath of air. My voice was a whisper again when I managed to speak again. “How do you not realize when you saw me at the hospital? How do you even think rec&mdash; how do you think this is <em>ever</em> possible? How does&mdash;”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. More tears.</p>
<p>“How does <em>Dad</em>? How could you see me then, how could you&mdash; how&mdash; how&mdash;”</p>
<p>My chest hurt.</p>
<p>“Crystal&mdash;” I said, I looked toward the house.</p>
<p>Crystal was still on the porch. Standing guard by the back door, red shield up. She watched me talking with my mom over one shoulder.</p>
<p>“I told Crystal the same thing I told your father. She was skeptical but she agreed it was for the best.”</p>
<p>I didn’t trust my mom’s version of events on that. Crystal at least had my back in this moment.</p>
<p>I tried to find words, and I didn’t have the oxygen.</p>
<p>“Catch your breath. We can talk this out.”</p>
<p>I worked at it, swallowing air.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait,” she said.</p>
<p>The sound of her voice made it harder, not easier.</p>
<p>When I spoke, my voice was very small. It gained more strength as I went.</p>
<p>“How can you have <em>not</em> been there, missed visits, or come to the visit and spend more time talking to doctors than to me because it was hard to be around me? How can you have come to see me then, and have had to avert your eyes mid-conversation with me, and found that hard, and not realize that I had to live it for two years, and had that be a million times harder for me?”</p>
<p>“I know it was hard, honey. I get it, I really do. But you can’t dwell in the past. It’s not good for you. You can’t carry that.”</p>
<p>“You say that, when you still sleep with the lights on,” I said.</p>
<p>It was her turn to not have words.</p>
<p>“That’s different,” she said, finally. She didn’t say how it was different.</p>
<p>I stared at her.</p>
<p>“I want <em>all</em> of us to conquer our demons,” she said. “I think you want that too.”</p>
<p>I continued to stare.</p>
<p>Finally, I said, “I want that too.”</p>
<p>“We can talk this out. We can find things we all want,” she said. “We can make inroads on this.”</p>
<p>She looked nearly as upset as I felt, even as composed as she was.</p>
<p>But in the end, and I’d known this from very early on, seeing her with&mdash; with <em>her</em>, she wasn’t a whole and complete person. She tried, she put on a good face, but my mother had been broken long, long ago, and with the way she’d put herself together, she retained only sufficient compassion, understanding, and empathy for a very small number of people. For one daughter, at most.</p>
<p>Second chances. Second go-around, and I wasn’t that daughter, this time.</p>
<p>“In the interest of putting my demons to rest,” I said. “I’m going to keep my distance. Don’t call, because I can’t trust a thing you say. I’ll figure out what I’ll do about Dad later.”</p>
<p>“Don’t,” she said. “Nothing gets better if you close off communication.”</p>
<p>There were things I wanted to say to that.</p>
<p>It wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p>I turned to go.</p>
<p>I heard the gravel under her feet as she gave chase, and I pushed out with my aura, hard.</p>
<p>“Do <em>not</em> use your power on me, Victoria Dallon. That has never been okay, and it doesn’t work anyway.”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath. There were things I wanted to say to that, too.</p>
<p>I settled for, “Let me go. If you follow me, I’m liable to hit you with something harder than my aura. I’m pretty sure that would work.”</p>
<p>It might have been a good line, if I hadn’t been choking back emotion as I said it.</p>
<p>I walked away. I didn’t trust myself to fly when I couldn’t see straight. Having a panic attack in the air made for an embarrassing moment.</p>
<p>People stood in rows at the fences that bounded their yards, staring and watching. I wiped away my tears once, then resolved not to shed more, not where people could see. I set my jaw.</p>
<p>In the background, I could hear my father’s raised voice.</p>
<p><em>Breathe. Center yourself. Move forward. Plan</em>.</p>
<p>I thought about what I’d need to do next. I couldn’t go back to the apartment I shared with my dad.</p>
<p>For the time being, I only walked, out in the general direction of the water. Streetlights lit up in advance of imminent cars and as I stepped onto the streets, turning off otherwise. Here and there they would turn on for wildlife, illuminating a lost deer or raccoon mid-scurry down the road. We’d set ourselves up so abruptly that the animals were still confused.</p>
<p>It was getting cooler. I wore my skirt, my clothes from earlier. My forcefield shielded against the wind, which kept it from lowering the temperature even further, but it didn’t do a lot to shield me from the ambient heat or lack thereof.</p>
<p>I tensed as I heard running footsteps behind me. I stopped in my tracks.</p>
<p>Not Crystal. She would have flown, and she would have set down well in front of me. She wouldn’t have chased, maybe.</p>
<p>Her, then.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to speak to her.</p>
<p>I pushed out with my aura, instead.</p>
<p>Another footstep, closer.</p>
<p>Our mother’s daughter.</p>
<p>I threw my arm back and to the side, a backhand swipe. I tore through lawn, through slabs of sidewalk, and the edge of the road. Dirt flew across the street alongside clumps of grass and chunks of sidewalk.</p>
<p>A long pause, and then I heard the footsteps again, running. This time the other way.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Gilpatrick jumped as I appeared in the doorway of his office, nearly knocking over a paper container of noodles in red sauce that rested on a stack of paper. Paperwork I would have been helping him with, had the day gone differently.</p>
<p>“Victoria? What’s wrong?” he asked.</p>
<p>So it was that obvious something was wrong.</p>
<p>“I need to call in a favor,” I said.</p>
<p>Okay, hearing my voice, I could get why he’d known. I sounded like another person entirely.</p>
<p>“If it’s okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s okay,” he said. “What’s wrong? Are you cold? The temperature dropped steeply tonight. What can I get you? Sit.”</p>
<p>He stood, circling around his desk. I backed away a little as he did, which was his cue to stop.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how to respond, how to ask.</p>
<p>“By the way,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, there’s no need to count. I consider you a friend, and I feel like a piece of shit for setting you up to fail like that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that,” I said. “I just need a place to stay tonight. While I figure some things out. I’ll be gone before the students arrive first thing.”</p>
<p>I noted the hesitation before he responded.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said.</p>
<p>“You paused.”</p>
<p>“Only because it’s not really a great place for staying overnight. You could come to my apartment, but that’s&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I kind of want space to think,” I said. “Offer’s appreciated.”</p>
<p>“There’s an issue with power rations and temperature is supposed to drop a few more degrees, and this place isn’t insulated well. It was a bitch last winter.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Gilpatrick said.</p>
<p>He kept giving me very deeply concerned looks. Almost pity.</p>
<p>I really hated those. I’d had a lifetime’s fill and then some.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “I’ve got a space heater right by my desk here. You’ll want to be careful if you’re leaving it running for a while, fire hazard.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be careful,” I said.</p>
<p>“There are blankets we stowed in the locker rooms that you can use if you want to sleep. You could get something serviceable if you gather a bunch. I laundered them not too long ago, too.”</p>
<p>“I know where to find them.”</p>
<p>“There are candles too, in case the power runs out. But again, fire hazard.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said. “I’ll be careful.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “You sure you don’t want company? We can talk it out, if you haven’t eaten I can go grab something, or…”</p>
<p>I was already shaking my head.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said. “I was needing an excuse to go home, this will do. Unless maybe I should stay around? You could settle in upstairs, and I’ll be all the way down here, you can have your space to think and you can still have me to talk to in case you decide you need it.”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “Don’t let me keep you. Go home. You’ll have angry parents to talk to first thing tomorrow, once they’ve figured out what happened and had time to get angry.”</p>
<p>He frowned. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Please,” I said. “I know where everything is.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. “You sure you’re okay? You’re not going to…”</p>
<p>He trailed off.</p>
<p>“If I was going to do anything, I’d take someone out with me.”</p>
<p>He scrutinized me.</p>
<p>“I’m worried here, for the record,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’ll manage,” I said. “I’ve managed this far.”</p>
<p>“You have my number,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You call if you need anything.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And you… be here in the morning when I show up. Which will be well before the kids do.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said.</p>
<p>He gathered up his paper container, a stack of his papers. He was trying to pick up the remainder when I approached, picking it up myself.</p>
<p>Silent, I walked him to his car, handing over the papers when it was time. I walked inside and locked the door behind me. The place was big and it was dark, with the open gymnasium space unlit.</p>
<p>I carted the space heater upstairs, and then I got the blankets. I got the candles and the matches, and then I found the file boxes, collapsed and gathered in piles.</p>
<p>I situated myself in my office, which wasn’t technically my office anymore, and I set to making the boxes, pulling my things off the shelves, and getting them stowed away.</p>
<p>The space heater hummed and the computer monitor clicked, as I periodically checked something or followed up on something I’d seen on a file.</p>
<p>I made a stack of the things I wanted to read, the files that intrigued or that I’d forgotten about, the magazines I liked. I was a third of the way through my shelves, twelve boxes filled, when I finally settled down in my chair, pulling blankets over me, and started to read.</p>
<p>I got about two pages read before deciding I didn’t have it in me to read more.</p>
<p>I didn’t have it in me to sit still, when my anxieties were churning.</p>
<p>I stood, dropping blankets on the floor, and walked over to the window. With the cold, the space heater, and the imperfect seal, moisture and fog had collected on it.</p>
<p>I reached out toward the window, a foot away from touching it. I turned on my forcefield.</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>Then a handprint on the window, in the condensation. Then another.</p>
<p>A circular smudge that streaked, a naked breast pressed against the glass, moving.</p>
<p>Then the mark that couldn’t be anything but one half of a face, beneath the circular smudge.</p>
<p>They moved, and I wasn’t asking them to move. The window rattled a bit as it was pushed against. The prints smudged.</p>
<p>A fingernail dragged against the glass, and produced a high pitched squeal, almost ear-splitting.</p>
<p>I dropped the forcefield. I sank back into my seat, and it protested the landing.</p>
<p>Not a second trigger. I was well aware of that. When I’d first had my forcefield, it hadn’t protected my costume. I had two theories as to why.</p>
<p>The first theory was that I’d grown, and the boundaries that the forcefield used to define ‘me’ had changed. I’d breathe out, breathe in, gain a pound here, lose a pound there, and it would adjust for the maximum bounds. It didn’t explain how my skirt was often protected, but I’d mused on that too, that my legs moved, my hair had been long at one point, I’d been shorter…</p>
<p>I’d been that, the forcefield had adjusted, and that was the new upper bound of what I was, forever with me.</p>
<p>It felt thin, as theories went.</p>
<p>The second theory was that it was the Manton effect, that broad-as-bells term for the built in protections and limitations of the power. The theory was that the built-in protections of the power only protected what I saw as a part of me, and it had taken some time before the costume was that much a part of my identity.</p>
<p>That <em>that</em> was me, now, as much as the costume I wore.</p>
<p>I couldn’t be that. I couldn’t sit still and be crushed under the weight of that thing.</p>
<p>I needed to do something, and taking books off the shelves felt like it was moving backward, not forward.</p>
<p>I spun around in my seat, and I loaded up the webpage. Something to do. Methodically filling out details on the group I’d seen, researching, filling myself in, and letting others know what they were up against.</p>
<p>Something constructive to keep me occupied until the power ran out, or until I was so tired I had no choice but to sleep.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap17">Daybreak &mdash; 1.8</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>
</p>
<p>Daylight streamed in at a low angle as I stepped back into my office. The light was blurred as it came through the condensation on the window, spotted with dots of darkness due to the melted frost that still clung to the window’s surface in lines and constellations of droplets. Ninety percent of my books were packed up, the boxes that were still here were stacked near the door and the bookshelf, labeled in thick marker, with shorthand notes on the most interesting and essential files within written on the boxes in pen. I’d left a few of the more interesting files available. I’d put them in a box on their own, in case I needed something to read.</p>
<p>My phone was plugged into the computer. I checked it, and made a small and sleepy pump of my fist as it lit up. Then I saw the red number on the digital-display dial, and let my hand drop. Missed messages: too many.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that I cared that much about the phone. It was that the phone being on meant there was power again. That the power was on again meant I could turn the space heater on. I flicked the switch, turned on my computer, then lit the candles for what little good heat they offered and wrapped a blanket around me before settling in my computer chair.</p>
<p>I was freshly showered, towel around my hair, and I’d gotten dressed in a slightly musty spare change of clothes. I had a blanket, candles, and a computer booting up. I watched as it started the struggle of fighting every other computer out there that was wanting a piece of the web.</p>
<p>There were worse ways to take things easy on myself.</p>
<p>I slid my to-do list across the desk until it was beside my keyboard. I’d need a car. Plenty of people were willing to offer the use of theirs in order to pay for fuel. Food, a place to stay.</p>
<p>Living accommodations might be tricky. Demand was high, and it was a pretty steep drop in quality from the central areas and the fringes. Many companies were putting up five or more houses a day or an apartment complex over the course of a week, slapping them together like there was a gun to their heads. When it came time to find renters, they were more interested in filling the spaces fast. They had no reason to answer questions or have a potential buyer investigating the nooks and crannies or checking the plumbing if they could turn that person away and have someone else on their doorstep within minutes.</p>
<p>It was a minefield. Word of mouth, cash, contacts, or luck were required to get a proper house that wouldn’t start falling apart after the fact. Fume Hood was one of the ones who’d been unlucky.</p>
<p>In more than one way.</p>
<p>My homepage was parahumans online, though. On top of the missed calls and messages on my phone, I had a slew on the site.</p>

<p>I marked it as unread and minimized it. I didn’t want to think about it for the moment.</p>
<p>News. Inquiry into the circumstances of Lachlan Hund. Not a trial, but an inquiry, some questions by people with more official standing. He’d fallen in with some sketchy people, and there were thoughts about there being powers involved.</p>
<p>The inquiry was the story of the hour, it seemed. Heroes stood by to step in and take him away to get help if officials were suspicious he’d been manipulated, but it was sounding like he would go home with his new family. That sucked.</p>
<p>Other articles, further down the pages. Fume Hood was alive, and she was a contentious topic. The actions on the part of the shooter seemed to have split people into two factions, with the ones supporting Fume Hood slightly edging out the ones who condemned her. Strange to see.</p>
<p>I wanted more info on her situation, and unfortunately, that was all I got.</p>
<p>I added another note to my to-do list. I’d reach out to Fume Hood, check in. I’d satisfy my curiosity and nag her about the name choice, which I’d been meaning to do but hadn’t had the chance to.</p>
<p>My eye traveled up to the unread messages. Crystal’s responses.</p>
<p>It all felt like I was taking a massive backward step. Like I was back in the immediate aftermath of Gold Morning. Two legs, two arms, bewildered, emotional. I was bothered, upset. I didn’t know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>I’d been angry at my parents then too. For various reasons. Angry at a lot of people and things.</p>
<p>I hadn’t and didn’t want that to define me.</p>
<p>I clicked on Crystal’s account name again.</p>

<p>I drummed my fingers on my desk, mused that my motivations might have to do with my being hungry.</p>
<p>More news articles. Some capes were taking on roles as icons and iconoclasts for the various movements in the civilian sectors. Four hero teams led the ‘icon’ groups. Advance Guard, Foresight, the Shepherds and the Attendant.</p>
<p>The first two were aimed at pushing forward. New approaches, doing things right this time. The opinions on what that way forward looked like it differed, feeding into the division between the two groups.</p>
<p>Things were changing. The Shepherds and Attendant had been groups divided along similar lines, but the Shepherds were self-combusting, and the remaining members were folding into the Attendant. There was some debate over what the name of the resulting team would be.</p>
<p><em>And then there were three</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>I idly browsed, caught between liking the Shepherd’s aesthetic and icons better while liking the Attendant’s mindset of moving slowly, with caution. I was suspicious it might end up being the opposite. As it was, the Attendant’s approach tacked on a bit too much ‘remember what we lost’ for my liking, clinging to the past, being defined by it, but&mdash;</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in,” I said.</p>
<p>Gil opened the door. He had two coffees in a tray in one hand and a bag in the other, and he had to juggle them both as he opened the door.</p>
<p>I rose to my feet.</p>
<p>“Sit,” he said. He nearly dropped his drink as he saw the boxes. “Shit on me, you’re packed.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be done in time to be gone before the students turn up,” I said, sitting.</p>
<p>“I’m not so concerned about that right now,” he said. He put the bag and coffees on the desk. “How are you?”</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>“You look better.”</p>
<p>I had a headache from not sleeping and not eating, and from the post-stress hangover, but I also felt lighter than air in a euphoric, fragile way. It was as if I’d just gotten over a bad round of the flu, and I was at the point where I was getting over the worst of it, but if I did the wrong thing or tested my body in the wrong way I’d be sick and hurting again.</p>
<p>Better.</p>
<p>I shrugged again. “Yeah. That word could apply.”</p>
<p>“Did you sleep at all?”</p>
<p>I snorted air out of my nose. “I’ll sleep when I’m so tired I have no other choice.”</p>
<p>“But you’re feeling better than you were?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Better than I was. Thanks for letting me stay over,” I said.</p>
<p>He pulled a breakfast burger out of the paper bag, and my eyes must have lit up, because he smiled, passing it to me.</p>
<p>A double-decker English muffin, with bacon, two eggs, lettuce, tomato and very sharp mustard.</p>
<p>I wasn’t normally one to eat egg, but I didn’t let that stop me.</p>
<p>I’d taken too big of a bite. I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>It was good. Visceral. Like Snag’s power, the hit of emotion as I enjoyed it was like a bit of metal, closing an electrical connection. Rounding off a thought I hadn’t wanted to make.</p>
<p>Feeding tubes. The insertions, the removals. The tube <em>being there</em>, one eye watching the beige fluid moving through steadily. Really wanting something <em>good</em>. Going almost four months without, because they weren’t sure I could. Then having it be a chore. It had been better than the alternative, but a chore, to force myself to eat it right, to chew it thoroughly enough.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard again, not because I had another bite to swallow.</p>
<p>Gilpatrick was looking at my files and notes, his back to me, my English muffin sandwich in my hands.</p>
<p>He glanced at me, saw the blinking, and looked away. “If you want to talk, I’m all ears.”</p>
<p>“I don’t, thank you,” I said. “I had a bad day, the part you knew about, then it got worse. Now I’m trying to get centered.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“This is really good,” I said.</p>
<p>“They are, I took a bite of mine in the car and then ate it before I got here,” he said. He bent over a box, looking at the notes. “Man, I wish I still had access to these files and books. I’d try bribing you if I could do it in good conscience.”</p>
<p>I swallowed again. “They’re mine and I’m too straightlaced to be bribed. You can call me if you want to ask about any of it.”</p>
<p>“Then I owe you more favors, am I right?”</p>
<p>“I thought we weren’t counting anymore,” I said.</p>
<p>He didn’t respond to that. He picked up a file, paging through it.</p>
<p>“Which one is that?”</p>
<p>“Ossuary. Why leave it out?”</p>
<p>“They’re back, or they will be soon,” I said. “Activist villains with a heavy focus on environment. They wouldn’t call themselves villains, I don’t think. Long list of really messy executions, longer list of leaders with very short tenures, who try to pull a very disparate group together, fail, and abdicate.”</p>
<p>“Were they the ones who used to call themselves Elephant Graveyard?”</p>
<p>“That’s the one. One of the early leaders pushed the name change along with a shift away from focusing on animals and animal welfare,” I said. “I liked Elephant Graveyard more, I think. Clunky, but clunky in a way that stands out, and it made for really good imagery, when they left a spray painted calling card.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to pry,” Gilpatrick said.</p>
<p>“About Ossuary?”</p>
<p>“About you. I spent a while thinking about what to do. I’ve had some good bosses and bad bosses over the years. When you throw yourself into the fray like you do when you’re a PRT squaddie, you really need to know that the people above you are looking out for you. That your back is covered.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. Same applied to family, to parents.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to push boundaries or cross any lines, and I don’t want to ask the wrong thing. When you say you don’t want to talk, can I ask why? Any answer you gave could help me make sure I’m covering <em>your</em> back as you move on to better things.”</p>
<p>“Because I’d have to fill you in on years of background and that’s not stuff I want to relive,” I said.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Because it’s confidential, because it’s messy, because… as cool as a guy as you can be, you can’t make it better. You can’t give me the answers or guidance I need because there’s a whole ream of things that’s separate and aside from the years of my background that you’d need to get into or know and… I’m going overboard with this.”</p>
<p>“I do want to hear,” he said. “Anything else?”</p>
<p>“That’s mostly it,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded. He rubbed his head for a second, thinking. “You want company?”</p>
<p>“Nah,” I said. “I’d just be packing the last few boxes. I wouldn’t mind a hand getting them out to the car, just to speed things up when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“You have a car?”</p>
<p>“I’ll get someone off of a listing or something. I’ve got to figure out what I’m doing, so there’s that too. I wouldn’t be good company, while I’m working through all of that.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be packed up and gone today,” he said.</p>
<p>“I kind of need to,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded, rubbing his head again. “I’ll cover the car. I’ll pay the driver.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>“You know where to find me. Place is empty, so you can shout from the stairs and I’ll hear you.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m going to head to my office. I’ve got something to do.”</p>
<p>I gave him a little salute.</p>
<p>Energized by food and coffee, still feeling lightweight, I worked on getting my boxes packed up. Along the way, I slotted my files and folders into the box I’d reserved for the most pertinent factors. The villains of the area, the heroes, and the villains turned hero. The hoods.</p>
<p>The day was warming up. The light from the sun was warm enough to counteract the lower temperature. By midday, if yesterday was any indication, it would be short-sleeves and shorts weather again.</p>
<p>A message popped up on my screen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>♦ Private Messages from Glitzglam:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Glitzglam</strong><strong>:</strong> game plan. u situate yourself at my place until you have apartment ur happy with. u &amp; I raid ur dads place while he at work, get ur stuff. standard attack formation, I play defense, make sure coast is clear, I support you, u take point and do what u need</p>
<p>I fired off my response. That worked. I had a couch to sleep on.</p>
<p>One thing off of my to-do list. I liked the progress. Progress was good. So long as I moved forward, I could stay aloft.</p>
<p>I cleared off the remainder of the bookshelves, stacking the boxes. I scribbled out my notes on the lid, checking the contents.</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
<p>“Come in,” I said.</p>
<p>Gilpatrick.</p>
<p>“Time for me to go?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nah,” he said. “There’s a bit. I don’t want to force you out the door like that.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I was thinking, over the past twelve hours, if you were my student, I wouldn’t want to let you go with things like this. Normally I’d contact a guardian.”</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat at that. No.</p>
<p>“But you said last night you had a family thing to do. I can connect dots.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I made some phone calls,” he said.</p>
<p>He stepped out of the doorway.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada. Shorter than me, hair tied back in a simple ponytail, wearing a skirt, white top, and jacket, with a simple, short string of pearls at her collarbone.</p>
<p>“Oh wow,” she said. “Look at you.”</p>
<p>I didn’t have words, so I just lifted my arms to either side and let them fall.</p>
<p>“Is this okay?” Gilpatrick asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I swallowed. “Yeah. Just about perfect.”</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you to it,” he said.</p>
<p>Jessica blinked a few times, before fanning herself. “I’m a little misty eyed. Sorry.”</p>
<p>I was a little misty eyed myself.</p>
<p>“Can I give you a hug?” she asked. When I nodded, she did so. I hugged her back.</p>
<p>“You put me down as your emergency contact?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said. “I&mdash; I honestly forgot I did that. It was more than a year ago.”</p>
<p>I’d had to name someone, and I hadn’t named my parents because&mdash;</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>“It’s more than alright,” she said. “Your boss said he was worried about you.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to reply, and then the waterworks started instead.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Jessica slammed the back hatch of her car, most of the boxes settled inside.</p>
<p>“Do you want to walk?” she asked. “Around the block, maybe? Or we could step back inside.”</p>
<p>If I was going to start crying again.</p>
<p>Students were just now starting to appear, and I didn’t want to sit still.</p>
<p>“We can walk,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s been amazing to hear your voice,” she said. “I know you were often frustrated, trying to communicate with the means you had available. I was frustrated too, but I wasn’t allowed to say that.”</p>
<p>“I could tell,” I said.</p>
<p>“You were a <em>challenging</em> patient, those first few months&mdash;”</p>
<p>I snorted.</p>
<p>“&mdash;but much like many teachers say they grow to care most about the class clowns and problem students, I came to hold you close to my heart. I wanted so badly to give you answers and to hear you out without having to rely on text to speech and letters you wrote between appointments. I wanted to dialogue, and it was so very hard to do that.”</p>
<p>“It was,” I said.</p>
<p>Why was it so much easier to talk about the things that I couldn’t normally even think about, like this?</p>
<p>“How did you find your way back from that?”</p>
<p>How did I become Victoria again, instead of the wretched thing in the hospital room, or in the home for invalids?</p>
<p>“My sister,” I said, my voice soft.</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s not an easy thing,” she said.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, my voice even softer.</p>
<p>I’d already filled her in on the details of yesterday and the past few months. She’d offered a listening ear. I’d spent all night working out my next few steps, I knew what the situation was, I didn’t really need more angles to view it from.</p>
<p>This, though… if I was going to make the most of the time I had with her here, then I wanted to at least get a handle on this.</p>
<p>“We were all brought to the battlefield during Gold Morning. There’s… that’s a hard topic to field.”</p>
<p>“There’s an unspoken agreement that the civilians don’t get to know,” she said.</p>
<p>“But you’re not really a civilian,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “I’ve heard reports. Some from very close to the center of the action. I know what happened.”</p>
<p>“Body, mind, and heart, you know how that’s a thing?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I lost my body, two years before Gold Morning. My heart was… twisted into something unrecognizable.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And… Gold Morning hit. And the&mdash;” I paused. There were people on the street, walking toward the school gate and the various block buildings as we walked away from it all. A tide we walked against. I had to shut up until people were mostly out of earshot. “And I was controlled in mind. I didn’t have much, but I could make my decisions. I could decide to use my power or not. She took that away from me, for a brief time.”</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to a number of people who had a very hard time with that.”</p>
<p>“You know who she was?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>I nodded to myself.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “My sister told me.”</p>
<p>Even if I was free to talk, the words still carried their ugly weight. The words and associated mental pictures still dragged my mood down.</p>
<p>“She knew me or knew of me, or she knew my sister. She decided in the end that she’d put my sister right next to me. She didn’t do that for many people at all, as far as I can tell.”</p>
<p>“And your sister healed you?”</p>
<p>“Gave me a body again. Um. She made me seventeen again. Walked back the clock, as if it… I don’t know. So she didn’t take two years of my life from me in body, like she did in everything else. I’m physically nineteen now, apparently.”</p>
<p>“You said body, mind and spirit. She fixed one of the three. Did she undo the effect on your emotions?”</p>
<p>I drew in a breath, sighed heavily. I nodded. “She actually&mdash; she turned off my emotions. Suppressed them. Then she asked me what I wanted.”</p>
<p>“What did you want?”</p>
<p>“I remember thinking, you know, it was really possible she wanted me to say that I wanted to go back to liking her. And if she did think that, then it was unconscionable. Divorced from all emotion, I thought it was unconscionable.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“And divorced from all emotion, I thought I’d be fair. That I’d give her the benefit of a doubt. That I’d assume that wasn’t what she meant or wanted. I told her I wanted to remember.”</p>
<p>“To remember?”</p>
<p>“Those two years,” I said, my voice hollow. I drew in another deep breath.</p>
<p>Further down the street, a nine or ten year old boy with straight black hair and brown skin looked at Jessica, his eyes widening, then he looked at me. He raised his hand, extending it toward Jessica as they passed one another.</p>
<p>She gave him a high five, then pushed his head, sending him on his way, toward the school.</p>
<p>“They weren’t good years.”</p>
<p>“Rationally? Divorced from emotion? I knew. I can’t forgive her. Ever. I can’t forget what she did, or she might do it again. To someone else. To me. I told her to fix my feelings and leave my brain alone otherwise.”</p>
<p>“It’s a heavy weight to carry,” she said.</p>
<p>“Those two years are really damn heavy,” I said. “Everything else is. But I’ve been holding on to that moment. I hate that I hold onto it, because she did it, but everything is tainted by her, so what can I do?”</p>
<p>“You hold onto it? How?”</p>
<p>“Being emotionless, putting those feelings away. My feelings and impulses got me into that whole mess in the first place. I hurt an awful lot of awful people, you know.”</p>
<p>“We’ve talked about that. You wrote letters outlining your thoughts and how you wanted to apologize to some of those affected.”</p>
<p>“My entire life leading up to that basketball game, I wanted so horribly badly to be a hero, you know? It felt like I thought about it every ten minutes. My parents were heroes, my cousin was, my aunt and uncle were, and everything revolved around it. I wanted it all so badly it hurt, and I didn’t have it for years. Then that basketball game, and I wanted to have <em>something</em> where I was the hero, where I got to stand out. Because sometimes it felt like my parents didn’t see me.”</p>
<p>“That’s been a recurring idea. You talked about their missed visits.”</p>
<p>“They came a lot,” I said. “I know that. My dad more than my mom. But every missed visit was a horrible thing, and the little things mattered so much when I had nothing else. Um. And this basketball game, I know I’ve talked about this before. But this one girl kicked my freaking ass. In my face, knocking me over, intercepting every pass, blocking every shot. She didn’t have any powers or anything, she was just… good. Better.”</p>
<p>“A lot of things came into focus in that moment.”</p>
<p>“Every time she or one of her teammates beat me, I could see the look of disappointment on my parent’s faces. In the other moments, they looked so bored. And it was boring, you know. No parent wants to go sit through amateurs doing badly at a high school sport.”</p>
<p>“Some do.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, she hit me hard, she said something about me being overrated, and it was the last straw. Realizing I stood so far from family, that I didn’t want to be there, but I had no other choice, my sternum was hurting where she’d driven her elbow into me. I got my powers.”</p>
<p>“Years of wanting, leading up to that.”</p>
<p>She’d caught the thread I’d wanted to lay out. It helped. “And then just under three years as Victoria-slash-Glory-Girl. And then… hospital.”</p>
<p>“Which was undeniably horrible.”</p>
<p>“It felt like my life had ended. No hope or help. All I had to cling to were those memories of the three years I was Glory Girl. I could look back, think about every fight, every encounter. The ones I was proud of. The ones I wasn’t. I had so much regret, replaying events out in my head. It started with me thinking about&mdash; that moment when it all went so wrong. When she messed with my emotions, then going backward.”</p>
<p>Emotions caught me. I made my expression a scowl, because I was worried what my face might do otherwise.</p>
<p>“I was such a stupid <em>fucking</em> kid,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s allowed,” she said.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Not when you’re as strong as I am.”</p>
<p>“And you want to be emotionless? I don’t know if that’s healthy.”</p>
<p>“Not emotionless. But… smarter about it. The idea I keep coming back to is I want to be a warrior monk.”</p>
<p>“A warrior monk?”</p>
<p>“Just&mdash; centered when it counts, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Why the warrior part? Do you envision yourself fighting?”</p>
<p>“I don’t honestly know. It never occurred to me.”</p>
<p>Jessica smiled.</p>
<p>“What’s next for Victoria Dallon?” she asked.</p>
<p>“You need to mock me, say Victoria Dallon, <em>warrior monk</em>,” I said. “I deserve it.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t,” she said. “If everyone in costume could remain centered while doing what they do, it would make a world of difference. I think it’s good. I’d think about that more as you take your next steps.”</p>
<p>“I know I want to move forward, because… I dunno. I feel like I’m a shark that drowns if it stops moving, or a bird that drops out of the air like a stone if I’m not flying forward. I know I need to get some of the basics of life squared away. I’m okay for money for a couple of months, but I can’t stay on Crystal’s couch.”</p>
<p>“In my brief interactions with Crystal, I did like her,” Jessica said.</p>
<p>“She’s great. But not great to live with long-term, I don’t think. You’d never know it to look at her, she’s beautiful, she’s fashionable, and very well put together, but if you looked at her apartment…”</p>
<p>I trailed off, using my expression to convey a bit of the horror to Jessica.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Jessica said. She smiled again.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do next.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’d think about how to apply the warrior monk role to your day to day life,” she said. She pulled off her jacket. The weather had warmed up enough. “What it means to you, why it’s the first thing or the recurring thing in your thought processes.”</p>
<p>“I just want to… <em>do</em>.”</p>
<p>“You said you regretted yesterday, but Jasper thanked you. Would you rather have not done it? Is it the ‘want’ in wanting to do things that’s problematic, or is it the ‘do’?”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath. “That’s… a very complicated question, I think.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to answer it right now,” she said.</p>
<p>“I think I can, though. I think… I had to. And as much as it was hard and cost me my job, I preferred it to the alternative. I can’t <em>not</em> do things that help out. I just want to do it in a good, centered way.”</p>
<p>“Could it be a mundane job? Construction? Desk work? Would you want to do something like you were doing with the patrol?”</p>
<p>I thought about it.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see it. Not long-term.</p>
<p>“What’s the first thing that comes to mind?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I think… fuck me, I think even now, I can’t quite see myself being anything but a hero. There are good people I’ve gotten to know. People I want to protect and help. Like Gilpatrick, like Weld and Vista and my cousin and a couple of the teenagers I was working with in patrol block. You. I want good things for them.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said. “That means a lot to me.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to convince myself there’s some other way, but… I can’t not do anything.”</p>
<p>“There’s worse things. Especially if you can do it smart and centered.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be Glory Girl,” I said. “Someone remarked yesterday that they’d thought she died and… good. She can stay dead.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like you have an idea of what you’re doing next.”</p>
<p>“It’s the wrong climate for it,” I said. “I <em>just</em> watched a team of heroes get eaten alive by the public. One took a bullet.”</p>
<p>“Figure it out,” she said.</p>
<p>I frowned.</p>
<p>“Again, there’s no rush,” she said.</p>
<p>“I can’t sit still,” I said. “There’s a bit of a rush.”</p>
<p>“Touch base with me,” she said. “We’ll go out for coffee, catch up. I can offer unofficial, more-friend-than-therapist advice. I think you’ll figure it out, and I can give you a few nudges here and there.”</p>
<p>That gave me pause.</p>
<p>“You’re not a therapist anymore?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Just the opposite,” she said. “I’m very much a therapist. Ten hour days, six or seven days a week, and other peripheral obligations. I’m afraid I’m not in a position to take you on as a patient again, Victoria, as much as I would dearly like to.”</p>
<p>That hurt. I didn’t want to say it, but it did hurt.</p>
<p>“I just joined the Wardens as a staff psychologist for their junior members and some special cases, and I’m just not equipped, unfortunately. If you want it, I could try finding a colleague who you could talk to. Most are as busy as I am, so it might take a bit of time.”</p>
<p><em>I want you</em>.</p>
<p><em>I want&mdash;</em></p>
<p>“Sorry to take up your time today, when you’re as busy as you are.”</p>
<p>“It’s more than alright, Victoria,” she said. She was looking straight ahead as she talked, one hand on her jacket as she walked. “With the hours I work, I lose objectivity. It becomes the work, and I lose sight of the patients. Sometimes it’s hard to see the wins. Like I said, you were a patient close to my own heart, and I thought you were one of the ones we lost. Seeing you, hearing you? It means the world to me. It gives me a measure of hope.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She looked over at me. “I’ll reach out to a colleague. I’ll see what I can do, if that’s okay. Give you some reassurance there.”</p>
<p>“I&mdash;” I started.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, but… if you wanted to reassure me&mdash;” I said.</p>
<p>It felt a little less like I could talk about certain topics with her, now.</p>
<p>“If it’s within my power, I’ll try anything,” she said.</p>
<p>“My sister,” I said, my voice soft. “Send someone her way.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada raised one eyebrow.</p>
<p>I knew what she was thinking. She wondered if it was selflessness, or if I was a surprisingly good person. I wasn’t.</p>
<p>“She’s the scariest damn person in the world, Jessica,” I said. “And I don’t think that’s bias. There’s a chance she’s going to do something bad, and she’s so damn powerful, that when and if it happens, it’s going to be so much worse than what happened to me, and it’s going to affect an awful lot more people.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap18">Daybreak &mdash; Interlude 1</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>The truck stopped at the gate, producing the occasional sputter and knocking sound as it sat there. The driver extended a hand out the window, waving for the camera, and the gate opened by way of remotely operated pulley.</p>
<p>It was another minute to the top of the hill, where the truck rolled to a stop in the parking lot, an expanse of gravel without any defined parking spots. The three people within remained where they were, warily observing the restaurant from a distance.</p>
<p>It was a log cabin writ large, the cedars stripped of their bark and stained with something that made them almost glossy, a warm yellow under the sun. The third floor was half the size of the other two, allowing the other half of what would have been the third floor to be a rooftop patio instead. A series of tables was scattered around the building, some close together and others a considerable distance away, as if they were trying to escape into the woods. Beyond the building was a cliff, and a vast expanse of forests, hills, mountains, and a small lake.</p>
<p>“Nice view,” Moose said, from the backseat.</p>
<p>Linc was settled in the passenger seat, reclining a bit with his seat angled back and his legs folded under him. With Moose in the back, he’d had to slide his seat as far forward as it could go, and it didn’t leave him much legroom. “Just think, past that view there isn’t nothing at all. If you headed straight ahead and kept going, you might not find any habitation until you ended up on the backside of this settlement here.”</p>
<p>“If you headed straight ahead,” the driver said, pausing to take a swig of the bottle of water she’d wedged into her cup holder, making a face at how warm it was, “You’d put yourself into that lake down there. Or you’d end up in the ocean. You’d drown either way.”</p>
<p>Linc smirked.</p>
<p>“People would call you an idiot,” she said. “Why would you go straight ahead like that? Are you proving a point?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s what Linc was getting at,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“Harper knows what I’m getting at,” Linc said, turning around in his seat to look at Moose as he said it.</p>
<p>Moose was a big guy, with tousled blond hair. He’d undone some of the straps of his mask and had the mask laying over one muscular shoulder. The mask was metal, crude, and Moose wore something cloth under it for padding, which he had on now. He wore a sleeveless undershirt, jeans, boots, and had two gauntlets sitting next to him on the car seat. Even with the truck being large and Moose lying down across the length of the seat, he barely fit. He didn’t seem to mind much.</p>
<p>Behind Moose and the truck was the gravel road that led up the hill, the gate checkpoint, and a ways below that, the simple settlement where most visitors would be made to feel unwelcome. One to two thousand people would be living there at most.</p>
<p>“They built this place and situated it on the very edge of civilization,” Linc said, to round off his earlier thought.</p>
<p>“You two always seemed like the kind of edge of civilization people to me,” Moose asked.</p>
<p>“We do okay,” Linc said. “Put us in the middle of a city, we do fine, eh babe?”</p>
<p>“Mm,” Harper made a vaguely affirmative sound. “This a trap, y’think?”</p>
<p>Linc turned his attention to the building at the top of the hill. “Nah. Why would you build a nice place like this and use it for a nefarious purpose.”</p>
<p>“Well, y’know, it’s gonna be nefarious. That’s why we’re here,” she said. “It’s a question of if it’s a murderous sort of nefarious.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good question, I admit,” Linc said.</p>
<p>“I knew a guy,” Moose said. “He had a mansion. Inherited or somethin’. Super nice.”</p>
<p>“The guy or the house?” Linc asked.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“The guy was nice or the house was nice?”</p>
<p>“The house. That’s what I’m gettin’ at. The guy was as nefarious as they get. He renovated the insides. He wanted to make a whole business of holdin’ people that needed holdin’. For ransom. Said he’d deal with ’em and clean up the mess if ransoms weren’t paid. Wanted to be a contractor for disposin’ of people in horrible ways.”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to just drop them off at the nice, conspicuous mansion, hand over cash?” Harper asked.</p>
<p>“That was it, I think. He’d make sure they died slow and horrible for you, clean them up, make sure they weren’t found.”</p>
<p>“Definitely not a nice guy then,” Linc said.</p>
<p>“I dare say he wasn’t,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“That’s a terrible idea for a business,” Harper said.</p>
<p>“It kind of is,” Linc said.</p>
<p>“Might’ve been,” Moose said. “He didn’t seem in it for the money, gotta say. I highly suspect he was more focused on the part where he would do horrible things to people. Guy has a nice place, he wants to do creatively bad things to people, and he wanted a bit of pocket money. Draw lines between each of those things and you end up with something shaped like his game plan there.”</p>
<p>“A triangle?” Linc asked, looking back at Moose. At Moose’s shrug, he elaborated, “If you draw straight lines between three things, you get a triangle.”</p>
<p>“Maybe the lines weren’t straight,” Moose said. “But if you’re wondering if this is a trap, I don’t think it being fancy is ruling anythin’ out.”</p>
<p>“It’s a log building, Moose. Nothing that fancy.”</p>
<p>“Fancy to me.”</p>
<p>Harper leaned forward against the steering wheel, to get closer to the windshield, squinting against the sun.</p>
<p>“What do you think, babe?” Linc asked. “Is it a murderous nefarious or a prosperous nefarious.”</p>
<p>“It’s something,” she said. “The people on the roof are in costume and some of them are looking at us. I think we better get ourselves inside or they’re going to start laughing at us.”</p>
<p>“They’re going to laugh whatever happens,” Linc said. “Your truck has seen better days&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Don’t go talking about my truck, Linc.”</p>
<p>“And we’ve got Moose with us, no offense Moose.”</p>
<p>“Some offense taken, thank you very much,” Moose said, indignant.</p>
<p>“You call yourself Moose. People are going to laugh. That’s when you show your merits and make them stop laughing, is the way it works.”</p>
<p>“People shouldn’t laugh in the first place,” Moose said. “The Moose is a terrifying and noble creature. If you wouldn’t fuck with a rhino, you shouldn’t fuck with a moose. It’s one of the only proper prehistoric, giant animal species to have the grit to last to today.”</p>
<p>Harper turned off the truck. The truck sputtered, coughed, and died abruptly, in a way that suggested it wouldn’t revive again.</p>
<p>“I know, bud,” Linc said, taking his eye off the truck’s much-abused, dust-caked dash. “I know that much, I’ve seen one up close. I’ve seen one run through snow that a normal person couldn’t walk in and hit a car hard enough to roll it. I have a healthy respect.”</p>
<p>“Damn right,” Moose said.</p>
<p>Harper gave Linc a look, pulling her full mask on and flipping up her hood.</p>
<p>“But <em>they</em> don’t all know it,” Linc said. “You gotta work with that. You picked a jokey name, you gotta put up with the jokes.”</p>
<p>“Hope was they’d be laughing with, not laughing at,” Moose said. “At least I’d hope you weren’t the ones poking fun at me. It’s unkind, Linc.”</p>
<p>Harper climbed out of the truck.</p>
<p>“I’m not laughing at, bud. I’m just saying they might be. That’s all,” Linc said. He pulled his mask on, fixed his hair and beard with few sweeps of his hand, and climbed out, then hit the lever to flip his seat forward and give Moose room to squeeze out.</p>
<p>Moose kept the cloth mask on over his upper face, leaving the metal mask on his shoulder. He stretched, his joints popping audibly, and pulled his fur-lined gauntlets on.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to take those off again if we end up eating,” Linc said.</p>
<p>“It’s about presentation,” Moose said. “Besides, the name doesn’t make sense if I don’t got ’em.”</p>
<p>Harper was in costume, though the costume part was mostly a hooded, sleeveless top in her namesake velvet color, lopsided in how it trailed down over one leg in a robe-like aesthetic. She wore skintight shorts underneath. A black mask covered her upper face, and had truncated, forking horns that poked out through the top of the hood and kept the hood from falling back.</p>
<p>Linc wore a mask like Velvet’s, but his traced the area around his eye sockets and eyebrows, with the edges tracing back and into his hair, forking as they did. He wore a bodysuit for the upper body and pants. His costume had always been meant to be layered, but the heat had forced him to strip down to the base layer, with the pants only because he felt like a clown if he wore only the skintight stuff.</p>
<p>People leaning against and over the railing on the roof watched them as they approached the door.</p>
<p>“This place is a hell of a lot better than the last couple we visited,” Prancer remarked.</p>
<p>“More expensive too,” Velvet said. She was looking at the blackboard posted by the door, with prices. “Twenty dollars for a chicken sandwich?”</p>
<p>“Come on,” Prancer said, pushing the door open.</p>
<p>The inside was expansive, with the kitchen as an island in the middle, counters and surrounding it, booths around the edges of the room, and tables in the space in between. There were only eleven non-staff people within, but the ground floor could have seated a hundred or more.</p>
<p>Prancer approached the kitchen island. He spoke to a black, twenty-something woman in a tan polo shirt and apron, “Who do I talk to for the rules?”</p>
<p>She jerked a thumb over her shoulder, indicating an elderly black man who was wiping out a glass. The man was watching, squinting with one eye, as he carried out the routine motion of cleaning the glass.</p>
<p>“He’s in charge?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>The employee gave Prancer a single nod.</p>
<p>“What can I do for you?” the man asked, as the three approached.</p>
<p>“We’ve been around the block a couple of times, I’m just looking for a primer on customs, and any special rules.”</p>
<p>“Payment up front for what you’re ordering, have the money ready when you order if it’s busy. Don’t cause trouble, don’t draw weapons, don’t be loud, give us a heads up and use the side door or the patio if your power is going to bother anyone. Upstairs is the bar, you don’t go upstairs unless you’re invited or you already know you qualify to go upstairs.”</p>
<p>“What kind of qualification?” Velvet asked.</p>
<p>“If you have to ask, you don’t have it,” the old man said. He put the glass down and picked up another. “Roof is for more private meetings than you’d have on the second floor. Don’t go taking yourself up there if you wouldn’t be allowed on the second floor.”</p>
<p>“Noted,” Prancer said. “Anyone to avoid, watch out for, anything like that?”</p>
<p>“That’s more for you to watch out for than for me to bother with. If they’re causing a problem or being a bother to others, they’ll get kicked out. If you help with the kicking out, I’ll give you something on the house.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Prancer said. “Got it.”</p>
<p>“Do you serve drinks down here?” Moose asked.</p>
<p>“We do. Anything fancier than beer or wine, we’ll have to send someone upstairs to fetch it.”</p>
<p>“Could I grab a mightyman?” Moose asked. He pulled off a gauntlet and retrieved a wallet from his pocket. He held out a twenty. “Long, hot drive.”</p>
<p>“Name?” the old man asked, gesturing at an employee. The employee set to getting the beer. The old man pulled a pad and pen out of his apron.</p>
<p>“Name? Uh, M.K.,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“No initials,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Just Moose then,” Moose said, sliding the twenty across the bar. “We can order food at the tables?”</p>
<p>“You can,” the old man said. He picked up the money, then pulled out a fiver from the pocket of his apron and passed it back to Moose. He looked at the others. “Names?”</p>
<p>“Prancer. She’s Velvet.”</p>
<p>“Do I need to worry about you?”</p>
<p>“Nah. We’re pretty tame. We’re here to make contacts and get our names out there for the small stuff.”</p>
<p>“If you do any business, be discreet enough I and my staff don’t see it. If you use powers, don’t bother the person next to you.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Can I grab a beer? What my buddy Moose is having,” Prancer handed over the bills.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>Prancer withdrew a larger bill from his wallet, and set it on the counter, sliding it toward the old man. “Gratuity?”</p>
<p>“No need,” the old man said. “Service fees and peace of mind are worked into the food prices. Order something, if you want to thank me.”</p>
<p>Beers in hand, they briefly considered sitting at the counter before Moose took a seat at one of the tables.</p>
<p>“Where you sit is important,” Prancer said. “Booth, you’re minding your own business, you’ve got walls around you. Sitting at the counter, you’re open to people approaching you and joining you, I think. Not entirely sure how it works here in particular.”</p>
<p>“I hear you,” Moose said, “But I was sittin’ funny the entire drive here, and if I sit on one of those stools then I’m going to have my back spasming the entire way back. I need a sturdy chair, here.”</p>
<p>“Sure, doesn’t matter that much,” Prancer said. He twisted around in his seat, one hand on his beer, taking a look at the others who were present. “Pretty laid back here.”</p>
<p>“Could be a quieter time of the day,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“Out of the way place, too,” Prancer said. “You heard what he said about using powers? How many places have we been to, and how many allowed use of powers at all?”</p>
<p>“Ten. Ten places,” Velvet said, hunkering down over her beer. “This is the only one, I think. Might have been a rule in The Well, but that was more the kind of place where you don’t know the rules until someone’s punching your face in for violating them.”</p>
<p>Prancer watched as a faint speck of dust traveled across his vision, pink-tinted. He smiled.</p>
<p>Four teenagers in the corner booth. They wore dark clothes with symbols and designs spray painted on and bleached into the fabric. One with a bandanna on his head looked their way, and Prancer flashed the guy a smile.</p>
<p>Three in another booth, against a wall. Tinkers. There was a cloth strewn out over the table, and parts were laid out. They ranged from twists of metal to a glass tube housing something that looked like a large, chewed wad of gum. The wad was throwing itself against the sides of its glass cage.</p>
<p>He wondered how that worked with the ‘no business’ rule. Were they only talking shop? Where was the line drawn?</p>
<p>Sitting alone in one booth was a woman with a mask covering her lower face, long black hair, and a long red dress with a slit down one side, exposing a tantalizing bit of leg. She wore an intricate framework of metal at her arms and hands, a series of bands at the elbow, wrist, knuckles, and rings at the finger, with thin rods of steel extending between each, along the back of each finger, and stopping at each finger and thumbtip. Each tip was enveloped by an ornate claw.</p>
<p>Her heels were much the same, Prancer noted. Heels were unusual for someone in costume, and hers were more unusual still. She wore something similar to her gloves, with the same bands at her leg, ankle, and foot, with the thin metal bars extending between each. Her toes were covered with the same metal claws, there was a strap of metal below the balls of her feet, and at her heel, one large claw-point served as the ‘heel’ of her heel, stabbing straight down.</p>
<p>When she moved one leg to fold one knee over the other, the claw tips moved on their own, twitching, recalibrating, the heel shifting back to stay pointed at the ground, flick back and away, then flick down.</p>
<p>She undid one side of her mask so it swung toward Prancer, still blocking his view of her mouth, helped by the draping of long hair, and she leaned down, taking a bite of her wrap. She put one hand to the loose end of her mask while she chewed, and fastened the end as she swallowed.</p>
<p>She saw him looking, turning her head his way. He smiled at her.</p>
<p>She only stared.</p>
<p>“Someone’s coming,” Moose said.</p>
<p>One of the spray painted kids. The guy Prancer had smiled at.</p>
<p>“You’re new.”</p>
<p>“Prancer, Velvet, M.K.,” Prancer introduced the group.</p>
<p>“Where are you from?”</p>
<p>“Alaska, believe it or not.”</p>
<p>“Long way,” the teenager said.</p>
<p>“Especially when you’re driving it,” Prancer said. “Who are you guys?”</p>
<p>“The group’s Ripcord. I’m Gorgos. We raid stores and resell, mostly. We’re nobodies. It’s the B-listers and small fry down here. The people with name recognition go upstairs.”</p>
<p>“Meaning the people we want to do business with are upstairs,” Velvet said, still leaning heavily over her beer.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Prancer said. “We’ll work it out.”</p>
<p>“What do you guys do?”</p>
<p>“We wheel and deal,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Prancer likes to be clever, but he doesn’t get that sometimes you have to explain why it’s clever, otherwise you only confuse people,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“It’s why I have you, babe.”</p>
<p>“The wheel part is getaway driving and transporting,” she explained.</p>
<p>The kid leaned forward. The decoration on his outfit looked like the sort done with a stencil and a spray bottle filled with bleach, strategically bleaching fabric. Snakes and a woman’s face as a recurring motif. He had a bandanna over the top of his head and one over his nose and mouth. “What do you deal?”</p>
<p>“Grass, mostly,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“You actually have some?”</p>
<p>“Not here, but we have it. Brand new and in high demand, given the times,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for resellers?”</p>
<p>“For the right price. Mostly we’re looking for new friends, and we’re trying to get the lay of the land before we do anything too enterprising.”</p>
<p>“Can I get back to you?” the guy asked.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome to,” Prancer said. “We wouldn’t mind company either, if you guys wanted to join us.”</p>
<p>“I’d have to get back to you on that too,” the guy said. “We’re trying to find our way these days. We agreed in the beginning we wouldn’t have one leader, and that was great then, but right now we’ve got two different leadership styles butting heads.”</p>
<p>Prancer looked over at the table, where those seated were having a very fierce, hushed discussion.</p>
<p>“If you want to just sit and trade stories, we’d be happy to have you,” Prancer said. “Get away from all that, maybe come away with some fresh perspective.”</p>
<p>“I might take you up on that. For now I’d better get back and make sure nobody reaches across the table to strangle someone.”</p>
<p>“Question before you go,” Moose said. “Is it always this quiet?”</p>
<p>“It’s about to get noisier,” Gorgos said. “Keep an eye on the guy at the end of the kitchen there. He communicates with people in town. He was talking to the boss about something and the boss put another cook on the stove. Wait ten minutes and I bet he’ll hit the button to open the gate. If he holds it down it’s a lot of people. My guess is the ferry from NYC hit the shore near the G-N portal twenty minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“Good to know, thanks,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>Gorgos jogged back to his team.</p>
<p>“You’re dwellin’ a lot on going upstairs,” Moose observed.</p>
<p>“Reminds me of being a kid and being told I had to stay downstairs with my cousins and their friends during the holidays. My cousins were assholes,” Velvet said. “One good thing about Gold Morning is it took them out of the picture.”</p>
<p>Moose whistled.</p>
<p>“She’s wearing the purple cloak, that’s a sign of royalty, don’t you know?” Prancer plucked at Velvet’s hood. Velvet batted his hand away. “And royalty doesn’t not go upstairs. Royalty doesn’t show mercy.”</p>
<p>“Y’know I went to prison because of you, Prance,” she said, quiet.</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. I will point out we survived Gold Morning because we weren’t home when Alaska got hit.”</p>
<p>“I went to prison for you,” she said, again. “That counts for a lot.”</p>
<p>“‘Course. How does that connect, though?”</p>
<p>“Just sayin’,” she said, her accent thicker as her voice became softer. “You said things would be different.”</p>
<p>“They will,” he said. He put a hand around her shoulders and pulled her closer, then kissed the top of her head. “We’ve got a decent crop, a lot of demand. We’ll do okay. We’ll make inroads.”</p>
<p>“I’m optimistic,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“I’m not unoptimistic,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“You’re not enthused either, doesn’t sound like,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“Just sorta hoping for more, sooner,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. There wasn’t much more to say.</p>
<p>Velvet reached out, and the menu flew from the tabletop to her hand. It was tinted red and dusty, but much of their table and glasses were, now.</p>
<p>Prancer took stock of the other three capes in the room before the newest batch of arrivals reached the front door.</p>
<p>There was one, who might have been a bouncer, who had stepped out the side door momentarily and was now taking a seat by that same door. He wore a mask of metal bars that looked like they’d been welded to one another, all vertical, but he also wore a black apron.</p>
<p>That left only the couple at the bar. Matching costumes, white armor with jet black iconography, multiple circles and crescents in various patterns, with the armor sprayed black around each icon, so it looked like the darkness glowed. The man wore full armor, the woman wore only scattered pieces of armor, with white chainmail to cover the rest of her.</p>
<p>They drank white wine, in the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Capes were strange people, Prancer mused.</p>
<p>“I want to be the kind of person who earns her way upstairs,” Velvet said. Her head still rested against his shoulder, where he’d pulled her close.</p>
<p>“That’s really stuck in you, huh?”</p>
<p>“It’s stuck,” she said. Without moving her head, she raised the beer to her lips and took a careful sip.</p>
<p>“You might have to lose the beater of a truck, babe, if you want to dress the part.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go talkin’ about my truck, Prance.”</p>
<p>“Every time you turn it off, it sounds like it’s off for good. I say a little prayer to myself that it will be, even knowing it’s a long, long walk back to home. Then I can take the money I’ve got saved up and buy you something nice. All the bells and whistles.”</p>
<p>“When I got out of prison, I only had two things, babe. That truck, and you. I wasn’t feeling especially fond of you at the time, either. It’s the only thing I’ve had for myself since I was old enough to have anything, that I’ve been able to keep.”</p>
<p>“Counts for somethin’, that,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“It does,” Velvet said, frowning down at her beer.</p>
<p>Prancer frowned at Moose, who only shrugged. Guy wasn’t making it any easier.</p>
<p>“What if we overhauled the outside, got someone to give the engine a real solid lookin’-at?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“So long as it stays my truck. I don’t want you ship-of-Theseusing it.”</p>
<p>Prancer resisted swearing under his breath. So that tactic wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>There was more of the pink dust in the air, now. He gave Velvet a kiss on top of the head, then shrugged slightly. She moved her head off of his shoulder, sitting upright.</p>
<p>“Things will be better,” he said.</p>
<p>She reached for his hand and squeezed it. “I’m going to go find the ladies’ room. Order food before things get hairy. I’ll have the chicken caesar sandwich and grab a few bottled waters while you’re at it. For the drive back.”</p>
<p>“You know the markup on those will be insane,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Just get me my water,” she said.</p>
<p>She walked away. Prancer watched her walk away, feeling wistful.</p>
<p>He signaled the waitress. He made sure to give Velvet’s order while he remembered it, and then gave his own. Moose put in enough of an order for two people.</p>
<p>When they were alone again, Moose commented, “Sorry, for interjectin’.”</p>
<p>“Interjecting?”</p>
<p>“When you were talking about the truck, and about prison.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Yep. Apology accepted.”</p>
<p>“Hard to be the third wheel sometimes. Especially when things get complicated, relationship-wise.”</p>
<p>“Can’t speak about the third-wheeling. That’s for you to figure out. But for the relationship part, it’s the simplest thing in the world, Moose,” Prancer said. “She’s my girlfriend, I’m her boyfriend. Sometimes you and she enjoy each other’s company, sometimes I enjoy someone else’s company, but that doesn’t change that it’s me and it’s her as the boyfriend and girlfriend.”</p>
<p>His voice had become progressively more stern as he’d talked. He paused, meeting Moose’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Makes sense,” Moose said. Prancer smiled.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t seem like you’ve had anyone but her keeping you company, gotta say,” Moose said.</p>
<p>Prancer looked at the woman with the mask on her lower face and the claw-heels. “Trying to be better.”</p>
<p>“Good for you,” Moose said, before taking a drink of his beer.</p>
<p>“I’m going to marry that Velvet sometime soon,” Prancer said. “I’ve just got to make amends for old wrongs first. Can’t ask her to marry me when the last momentous event in our lives was me being a screwup.”</p>
<p>“The prison thing?”</p>
<p>“Everything before, too. Trying to be better.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to step on any toes or get into anythin’ too sensitive here,” Moose said. “But can I ask? Would be easier to not step on toes if I can ask.”</p>
<p>“It’s the whole thing. Get powers as a kid, sixteen years old, make friends with the right people, start dealing. It’s an elevation in status, y’know? I was the guy who the cool kids in high school went to for product. Had money, had girls throwing themselves at me, I was invited to all the parties, and I meet Velvet there. One of many girls in one of many cities. But she gets powers and comes back to me, wants in, wants out of her house, especially. I oblige, and she doesn’t make me regret it.”</p>
<p>Moose nodded.</p>
<p>“Years pass, we find our fit. She’s got more financial sense, I’ve got the salesmanship. Most capes, there’s going to be conflict. She’s got her thing, you know how her power works. She hangs around somewhere, and this dust collects, and she can telekinetically control stuff, more dust there is on it. It’s how she gets that fucking truck going again, when it refuses to move. She makes us sit there for five minutes and then gives it another try, and it works, and she’ll fiddle with it later and get it tuned up just enough it starts going.”</p>
<p>“She must care an awful lot about it,” Moose observed.</p>
<p>“She does. But that’s her whole psychology. She wants to settle in, wants to have a place she can call hers, whether it’s that truck cab or, I don’t know, going upstairs. I get restless. The mover thing. That causes friction. But we work despite it. We’re as soulmate as you can get when you’ve got… whatever these things are giving us our powers. Parasites. You had the visions when we were on the battlefield, that day.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“As yin-yang soulmate as you can get with these things screwing up the fit,” Prancer said. “But we got comfortable. I graduate school, barely, she graduates a year after me, we keep up the routine. Some wheeling, mostly dealing. The parties every weekend, tooth and nail fights because we’re both the type to flirt with others, before we realized we were fine just not worrying about it. Couple more years pass, I’m twenty-one, she’s twenty, still in the routine.”</p>
<p>“A rut?” Moose asked.</p>
<p>“Just the way things were. Somewhere along the line, you know, I’m twenty-seven, she’s twenty-six, and I’m still boning boys and girls from high school. Still partying.”</p>
<p>Moose’s eyes had widened.</p>
<p>“Legal, mind you,” Prancer said. “But… sketchy, in retrospect.”</p>
<p>“More than a little, no offense,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“None taken. I deserve it. I didn’t realize until they came after us. Capes, police. You get into a groove and you don’t think about things and somehow a decade gets away from you. You’re not the cool guy people are excited to get to know. You’re the guy they’re into because they have to be if they want a discount, or if they want someone accessible that’s older. Sad. Pathetic. Slapped me in the face while people were talking to and about me in court. Forced me to take a long, hard look at who I was and who I wanted to be.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” Moose said.</p>
<p>A young woman entered the restaurant. Prancer almost thought it was the first of the influx, but she was alone. She was an older teenager or twenty-something, with long white hair, wearing a black dress and black makeup, and she took a seat alone at the table. She rummaged in a bag to find a book.</p>
<p>The waitress approached her, kettle already in hand. The money was passed across the table, and the tea was poured. A regular.</p>
<p>Her mask was so simple it might as well have not been there. Curious, too, that she’d come this far to read a book. Maybe someone would be joining her.</p>
<p>Prancer watched the new arrival, but he kept talking, “She told me, over and over again, I needed to be better. That she wanted better. That we needed to be careful. I didn’t listen. We got out of prison, she took me back, and I owe her for that.”</p>
<p>“If your critical flaw was not listening, might be you’ve gotta listen when she’s saying she loves that vehicle out there.”</p>
<p>Prancer nodded slowly. Then he let his head loll back, and he groaned. “I’ve put up with that thing for so many damn years.”</p>
<p>Velvet’s glass of beer slid across the table, and Prancer caught it just before it could reach the edge of the table and tip into his lap.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about my truck?” Velvet asked, making her way back from the restroom.</p>
<p>“Moose is telling me to let it go,” Prancer said. “I’m trying to come to terms with the idea.”</p>
<p>“You’re a good boy, Moose,” Velvet said, taking her seat. The glass pulled out of Prancer’s hands, sliding across the table to slap into Velvet’s hand.</p>
<p>“Appreciate that, Velvet.”</p>
<p>“Did you order or did you forget?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Remembered,” Prancer said. “It’s coming soon.”</p>
<p>The front door opened.</p>
<p>A large collection of capes entered and immediately headed off to find their booths and tables. One of the new arrivals stepped inside and loitered by the door. She was a woman with a slender figure and a bag over her head, for lack of a better description. The bag was cloth, with a pink animal pattern on it. The rest of her form-fitting outfit matched, including the shawl she wore.</p>
<p>Prancer leaned in the direction of the door, putting his mouth near Velvet’s ear. “I see Nursery. I wonder if Blindside is around.”</p>
<p>“I hope the kid’s okay,” Velvet said. She looked at Moose. “Were you there when we talked to ’em?”</p>
<p>“I was.”</p>
<p>“They were up to something.”</p>
<p>“I remember.”</p>
<p>A man in armor was one of the last to arrive. The armor was white, and looked like it was fashioned of strips, woven and wound around him, the ends left frayed and sticking out to the sides and behind him. There was no face to it. Only a Y-shaped set of ridges. He stood between Nursery, a man in a black outfit and heavy hood, and a heavyset man with long hair, a dense beard, and a mechanical arm that extended to the ground.</p>
<p>At his arrival, people across the room started applauding, from Ripcord to the people at the counter, to the white haired girl and the woman with the mask. Even the kitchen staff. The man in armor laughed, the sound mingling with the general applause.</p>
<p>Moose joined in, and Velvet and Prancer offered their own light, confused applause.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Thank you. Is Marquis here?” the man in armor asked.</p>
<p>The old man at the kitchen pointed skyward. “Roof.”</p>
<p>The man in armor saluted, then ducked back through the door.</p>
<p>Velvet raised her hand to get Nursery’s attention. The woman’s group was already splitting up. The man in black joined the people in white armor. The bearded man with the mechanical arm walked over to the woman with the claws, sitting in her booth.</p>
<p>Nursery approached the table.</p>
<p>“Good to see you,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think I would see you three all the way out here,” Nursery said.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to see who’s out there. The other places have been a little seedy.”</p>
<p>“They are. Seedy can be fun, though,” Nursery said. “Reminds me of the old days.”</p>
<p>“You keep updating your costume,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“Silly thing, isn’t it? It’s easier to make a new one than to wash the blood and slime out. I feel ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“What was happening with the applause?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“Mission success,” Nursery said. “In a roundabout, unexpected way, but that’s often how these things go.”</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Moose. It was a thing. We took a week to figure out what we were doing, we had to check with a few people, a number of thinkers, make sure we weren’t stepping on toes. The peace being what it is, we didn’t want to cause too much trouble.”</p>
<p>“Was it a big mission?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“Big,” Nursery said. “Plenty of room for things to go very wrong, with some bad repercussions that could be felt by <em>everyone</em>.”</p>
<p>Prancer’s eyebrows went up.</p>
<p>“But we were careful, we had the right people&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You included among those people,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Nursery said, clasping her hands together.</p>
<p>“What was the job?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“To kidnap someone, and have her disappear for long enough that people would get upset about it.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“They’re anxious out there. They feel powerless. The idea was to pick someone controversial, and take them out of the picture. Make them the topic of debate. Is vigilante justice right or wrong? In this case, where the wrong isn’t so terribly wrong? Well, that was their idea. I do think she did something horrible. It’s why I agreed to the job.”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“Hurt a woman and made her miscarry. They say it was a mistake.”</p>
<p>“I can see where that hits close to home.”</p>
<p>“Sorry to hear,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You’re kind. The plan was to provoke the debate and raise the issue before things reached a more critical point. Venting off the steam before things exploded. The debate seems to be trending that way.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it needed a fine hand,” Velvet said. “That’s some good work.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do it alone,” Nursery said.</p>
<p>“Your first time working with the others?”</p>
<p>“It was. Lord of Loss is sweet, good at what he does.”</p>
<p>“He went straight to the roof, I’m guessing that means he isn’t the type to work with B-listers like us.”</p>
<p>“No, I suppose not. He doesn’t like being indoors. You’re recruiting? That’s what you’re asking after?”</p>
<p>“Or looking for a spot of work,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Snag, sitting over there, is looking to hire people for a project down the road. He wants to do test runs first, make sure he succeeds on the first try. Those two hired the same information broker we worked with for that job.”</p>
<p>“You had an information broker?”</p>
<p>“She was ops too. Talked to us on the earpieces. A little shaky on some things, surprisingly quick on others. But I think you run into that with any thinker.”</p>
<p>Prancer nodded.</p>
<p>“Snag is a few months new, a rookie, with a rookie’s mindset, but he has good instincts. If I can say this in confidence…”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“…I wouldn’t want to be on a team with him long-term,” Nursery said. “He’s mean. Unkind, impatient. Emotional. You get that with a lot of the new ones. Too close to whatever set them off.”</p>
<p>Prancer nodded slowly. “Old ones have their own problems. Ruts and routines.”</p>
<p>“They do. Um, I should hurry. Blindside has a mouth but I do like them. They do a decent job, if you can work around the limitations. They’re outside now, sitting on the patio by the side door. Can’t come inside without turning a few heads.”</p>
<p>Prancer smiled at the bad joke.</p>
<p>“Kingdom Come likes his bible verses, I earned some considerable brownie points by knowing the names and numbers to go with most of them. Benefit of bible school until I was eighteen. He’s a consummate professional. Very gentle, very efficient.”</p>
<p>“Expensive?” Velvet asked.</p>
<p>“Not too bad, I don’t think. I don’t know what he was paid, but if it’s close to my own wage, it shouldn’t be horrendous. He’s very selective about the jobs he’ll accept.”</p>
<p>“What about you?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“Me? I’m boring. I’m not even a parahuman, not really.”</p>
<p>“Wait, what?” Moose asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Nursery said. She had a light tone of voice, like she was smiling from the other side of the cloth mask. “It’s why I feel so out of place in costume.”</p>
<p>Prancer watched as others came through the door. He recognized Biter but failed to get Biter’s attention with a wave.</p>
<p>“How does that work?” Moose asked.</p>
<p>“Show him the bump,” Velvet said, smiling.</p>
<p>“The bump?” Moose asked. “Oh.”</p>
<p>Prancer glanced over at Nursery, who was holding her cloth costume tighter against her stomach, showing her slightly protruding belly.</p>
<p>“They’re the parahuman,” Nursery said. “I’m the ride.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Moose said. “Oh wow. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“No need to be sorry. It’s a bond unlike any other,” Nursery said. She gave Moose a pat on the cheek. “It’s hard sometimes, but I owe it to them. Making up for mistakes I’ve made.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Prancer said, staring at his beer. He looked from his glass to Nursery. “Don’t be too hard on yourself, hm?”</p>
<p>“I’ll try,” she said. “I should go. Take care and wish me luck.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” Moose said. He still looked shell-shocked.</p>
<p>“What’s next?” Velvet asked, smiling.</p>
<p>“What we did yesterday is only one instance. They’ll have to do it again when the pressure builds. Sooner or later, however many thinkers they work with, however good the people they hire, there will be a mistake. Something will happen, it could be too much, too little, and then everything goes to hell in a handbasket.”</p>
<p>“Heavy,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“But I’ve stayed too long. My baby and I earned ourselves an invite upstairs, because they might hire me again, and because we showed our stuff, I don’t want the offer to expire,” Nursery said, excited. “We can’t drink at the bar, but it’s still a chance to meet some of the people running the corner worlds, the major players. A huge opportunity.”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing,” Moose said, looking down at the bump. “Congratulations. Both of you.”</p>
<p>“You’re so sweet. I should go, excuse me,” Nursery said, leaving.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk again,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>Velvet raised a hand, her smile frozen on her face. Prancer reached over to squeeze her thigh.</p>
<p>“I think I hate her now,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>He gave her leg another squeeze.</p>
<p>His thoughts turned over as he watched the people enter. Some headed upstairs. Ones with nice costumes, scary ones. He recognized quite a few.</p>
<p>There were also the others. The B-listers, the dregs, the people who weren’t yet established, filling up the ground floor, ordering their food and drinks.</p>
<p>“Hey Moose,” he said.</p>
<p>Moose stared off into space, in the direction of the stairs.</p>
<p>“Moose,” Velvet said. “I’m pretty sure she’s a loon. I wouldn’t worry too much about it.”</p>
<p>“Moose,” Prancer tried again.</p>
<p>Moose frowned, glancing back at the stairs. “Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Look at the room. Tell me, who do you know here?”</p>
<p>“Some of the big guys. Biter, you and I had drinks with him. Etna, Crested, Beast of Burden, Bitter Pill, Nailbiter, Hookline, Kitchen Sink.”</p>
<p>“Do me a favor?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Round ’em up. Anyone you get along with, who you think wouldn’t cause a fuss.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Still figuring it out,” Prancer said. “You recognize anyone?”</p>
<p>“Few people. You want me to gather ’em?”</p>
<p>“Please. We might have to take it outside. Actually, let’s definitely take it outside. By the side door. So the owner doesn’t complain.”</p>
<p>“You’ve piqued my interest,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>Prancer nodded, still lost in thought. He watched as she walked away, pausing to feel a moment of fondness for her, and then resumed his thinking. He made his way to the side door.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Blindside said.</p>
<p>“Hey. Gathering some people. Thought we’d come to you, invite you to hear me out.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Prancer. What’s this about?”</p>
<p>“Give me a second to think. I’m a salesman, and I’ve got to figure out exactly what I’m pitching.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Prancer stuck his fist out, stopped where Blindside’s power made it stop. He felt Blindside tap a fist against the side of his hand.</p>
<p>The others assembled. The people who had been invited, then the people who hadn’t, who were curious.</p>
<p>“I want to organize,” he started. “I’m not the person to lead it, don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a power play. I’m not a power player. But I think, right now, while we’re still at peace, while there aren’t so many people who have beefs with one another, or the beefs have had two years to go quiet, this would be the chance to do it.”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t be the first person to think about doing this,” Biter said.</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No, some other groups, some small, some large. They’re banding together, a mutual peace. Forming a set of rules and expectations that aren’t unwritten, that we actually discuss and work out.”</p>
<p>“With the little guys?” Prancer asked. “B-listers? Those of us who aren’t being focused on while the big guys are laying out tracts of territory and settlements?”</p>
<p>“Some of them. Those groups are smaller than you’d be talking, if you’re talking about everyone here.”</p>
<p>Prancer nodded.</p>
<p>He glanced at Velvet, and he saw the way she was looking at him, and he felt like a proper <em>man</em> for the first time. She reached for his hand and squeezed it, hard.</p>
<p>Then, more alive and excited than he’d seen her in a long, long time, Velvet spoke, “You think they’d be open to talking?”</p>
<p>“I think they might,” Biter said.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap19">Flare &mdash; 2.1</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p><em>“The Wardens are cooperating with seven major cape teams and, last I checked, ten minor teams. We are not a monolithic entity. We are not an authority. We are not the bad guys, Julia.”</em></p>
<p>I rummaged through a cabinet. My life was in boxes, from my clothes to my hair and skin stuff to my files. If it were that alone, it would have been tolerable. I’d tried using logic and going to the most common sense places. Not in or among the dirty dishes, not in the various jars and vases of spoons and spatulas on the counter, not behind or under something. I’d checked the other rooms in the apartment.</p>
<p><em>“People are worried. You have Legend as a second in command, and memories aren’t so short that we don’t remember the Alexandria fiasco.”</em></p>
<p>I moved methodically through the kitchen, left to right, while the television played on a low volume.</p>
<p><em>“I can tell you this: all we want to do is help. We want to find the right capes for the major crises and we want to equip the teams out there with information and resources. ”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s admirable, but&mdash;”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, wait, hold on, Julia. You told me when you asked me to have a chat with you on camera that you wanted to have a conversation. Let me say this.”</em></p>
<p>I looked at the little TV in the corner of the kitchen.</p>
<p><em>“…that people are going to draw on what they know to fill the blanks, when they don’t have enough information. I understand that the closest parallel that many Americans draw to the Wardens is the PRT. Give us time to make our impression and show how we operate,”</em> Chevalier said.</p>
<p><em>“Would you not say there are quite a few of those blanks when it comes to your organization?”</em> the reporter asked.</p>
<p><em>“I accepted this interview because I want to fill some of those blanks.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Are you an open book, then?”</em></p>
<p>My eyebrows went up. That was dirty pool from reporter Julia. There was no way that question wouldn’t be followed by something that Chevalier couldn’t or wouldn’t want to answer, cornering him.</p>
<p><em>“Some of those blanks,”</em> Chevalier said, stressing the ‘some’. <em>“We’re still figuring things out, we’re still finding our footing and we’re negotiating a comfortable and healthy position with the public, the various teams under our umbrella, teams that aren’t under our umbrella, and the authorities. The lack of answers and the number of blanks isn’t me being evasive or underhanded. It’s that the Wardens and society as a whole have a lot of figuring out to do.”</em></p>
<p>He was good at what he did, and he did a lot. I wished I was in a position to study what he was saying and how he was fielding the questions, but I had more hunting to do.</p>
<p>I went back to the drawers I’d already checked, pulling out the cutlery drawer enough that I could check the back, behind the tray that held the forks and knives. I was too used to drawers having a mechanism that stopped them once they were pulled out to their limit, and I’d expected it to be longer, which led to me pulling the drawer straight out of its housing.</p>
<p>I only barely caught it, sticking my knee out under it and moving my hands to grab the sides. The cutlery rattled loudly, with a few miscellaneous cheese and holiday themed knives clattering to the floor.</p>
<p><em>“…would you say about the rumors circulating around Valkyrie, then?”</em></p>
<p>I put the drawer on the countertop, collected the fallen knives, and sorted through the contents, lifting up the tray to make sure nothing had fallen beneath. No luck.</p>
<p>I tried to put the drawer back, failed a few times before realizing that the construction wasn’t especially sturdy, and that the back end had pulled a bit loose. I fixed it, then resumed trying to put it back inside the hole it was meant for.</p>
<p>There was the saying: affordable, nice, or safe and sane. Pick one. It was a chronic problem with the speed they were trying to get buildings and houses up. Shoddy construction, rush jobs, cut corners, mistakes, and general ugliness were pretty normal. I was hopeful that in a little while we might be able to get to a point where it was ‘pick two’ instead of ‘pick one’, but we had a ways to go.</p>
<p>I tried to squeeze the end together where two pieces didn’t quite meet and simultaneously push it in with my stomach. It refused to slide in.</p>
<p>“What are you doing to my kitchen?”</p>
<p>Crystal was in the doorway, her hair a mess. She wore an oversized t-shirt and pyjama shorts, and she still looked half asleep.</p>
<p>“Did I wake you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Uh huh,” she said, sleepy. “Don’t tell me you’re a morning person. That would be a problem.”</p>
<p>“I’m not. I’m a person who fell asleep early last night&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Almost right after eating. Yep. And now you’re up, showered, dressed, and you’re dismantling my kitchen. For reasons.”</p>
<p>“I woke up and thought I’d keep my normal work routine while I figure out what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>“Renovating my kitchen?”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to find scissors,” I said. “I’d settle for a sharp knife.”</p>
<p>Crystal smiled wide, her eyes still sleepy. She grabbed a glass from a cabinet, and she half-walked, half-floated across the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Don’t laugh,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re such a cliche,” she said, as she passed me on her way to the sink. “Oh my god, Victoria. You’re that person with super strength that trashes everything she touches.”</p>
<p>“Just help me,” I said.</p>
<p>She reached over and helped me hold the drawer together. As it slid into the confines of the front of the counter, the framing held it together where the drawer’s own construction wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t using my super strength, for the record,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve done that with the drawers before, I’m just making fun of you. It’s a funny image, to walk into the kitchen and see that.”</p>
<p>“Ah ha,” I said. “Then can I make fun of you for having two big jars of spatulas, whisks, spaghetti scoops, having two food processors&mdash;”</p>
<p>“One was a gift.”</p>
<p>“&mdash;And no scissors or shears anywhere I can find? I’d settle for a sharp knife. You have those steak knives, but they look nice and I don’t want to use them for the wrong thing and ruin them.”</p>
<p>She reached across the counter to get the package of bacon, holding it up. It was inside a hard plastic tupperware-like container with a small black and white label stuck to it. A mark stamped on it had it sourced from another world. Even without the mark, the pricetag might have given it away.</p>
<p>“Thought I’d treat you to breakfast,” I said. “Went for a walk to get some stuff.”</p>
<p>Still appearing half asleep, she moved one hand, creating a deep red forcefield behind the bacon, then she produced a thin laser from her fingertip, slicing off the end of the package.</p>
<p>She handed the bacon to me, open end up.</p>
<p>“You don’t have scissors?”</p>
<p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>
<p>I sighed, picking up the bowl where I’d already mixed the dry ingredients. “Fruit crepes, bacon on the side?”</p>
<p>“Sounds amazing,” she said, leaning against the counter, eyes mostly closed.</p>
<p>“You look beat,” I said.</p>
<p>“It was pretty unforgiving, being there. I timed everything so I could unwind starting with the barbecue, and unwinding didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“That’s not on you.”</p>
<p>“I’m still sorry it happened.”</p>
<p>“You slept okay though?”</p>
<p>“I slept a solid ten hours. I just… started sleeping at six thirty or something. Then I woke up, I started thinking, and I decided to be productive. I’m talking to some teams today.”</p>
<p>“If you want me to put a good word in with my guys, I’d be happy to.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to do the quasi-military cape thing,” I said. “A little bit too intense.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Crystal said. “I’m so physically tired, two days out, that I’m not sure I would be standing if I couldn’t fly.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the ground. Her feet were barely touching the ground.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the physical intensity that worried me. It was the mental and emotional cost. It was the fact that when it came to the military and the military-like stuff, the trend was to beat the individual into shape. Organization, conformity.</p>
<p>I couldn’t take much more of the harsh lessons on identity or the forced redefining of the self.</p>
<p>“I’m just waking up, so forgive me if I got something wrong, but did you already find a place?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“You took the sheets off the couch.”</p>
<p>I looked over at the living room. There were boxes stacked around, and only half were mine.</p>
<p>“You said you might have friends over at some point, I thought it’d be weird if you had to navigate around my stuff, so I moved it out of the way.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said. She paused. “I’m tired, so I want to make sure I say this right.”</p>
<p>I went to the fridge to get the fruit stuff I’d already prepared.</p>
<p>“I don’t care,” she said. “First of all, I know I have a lot of stuff. You know I have a lot of stuff.”</p>
<p>I looked at the stuff around the kitchen and adjacent living room. It was a bit messy, to the point counter space and table space was occupied.</p>
<p>“Just&mdash; I really don’t care if you add your stuff to it. I like my places feeling lived in. Some of the stuff is a friend’s, and they’ll take it when they get set up. Some is mom and dad’s. Some is yours, and that’s fine. That leads me to my second point. I <em>want</em> you to be here. I want you to feel comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I know my couch isn’t much, but you need a place that you can kick your shoes off and leave them where they are.”</p>
<p>I might have mentioned that I wasn’t quite that personality type, but I held my tongue. I understood the sentiment, what she wanted.</p>
<p>“I want you to have a place that’s yours, Vic.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“I’ll start by asking this: why not be independent?”</p>
<p>Foresight had a strong aesthetic running through their costumes. Primary among those things was a mask or helmet design where each of the members of the team lacked eyeholes. Helmets with opaque visors, masks without eyes. The aesthetic involved lots of paneled body armor and loose fabric elsewhere, with iconography worked into the panels. It made me think of ninjas from movies, with the mix of lightweight costumes and armor, but without the Eastern style.</p>
<p>Their team symbol was a stylized eye, sans pupil, with a wildly exaggerated ‘4’ struck out in bold lines that extended well past the curved lines of the eye.</p>
<p>I was wearing my best civilian clothes. I’d opted to leave the mask off. I sat in a chair. Two of them sat in chairs in the office, and another two stood at the side.</p>
<p>I gave my answer. “If I’m being entirely honest, independent doesn’t pay unless you’re really good. At the risk of sounding arrogant, in another time and place, I think I could scrape by because I do have that experience, I have the knowledge, and I can hold my own.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think you could do it now?” Countenance asked. He was the second in command and the highest ranking team member in the room. His outfit was heavier and draped more than the others, both in how the cloth hung loose and how the armor panels were connected so they dangled from the piece above. The Foresight icon was in the center of his mask, like a cyclopean eye.</p>
<p>“I know who Foresight is and how you operate,” I said. “I know you want to move forward, you’re interested in helping the little guys, tackling the right issues, and take decisive, needed action in a calculated, smart way.”</p>
<p>“You read our webpage.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been following Foresight since it started,” I said. “Whatever answer you give me today, I’ll be following you guys from here on out, because I think it’s important to know the lay of the land. Which goes back to what I was saying. Being calculated, being smart. I’ve been watching and researching you guys, and I’m sure you have the mentality where, from the time I reached out about an interview, you were looking me up and asking questions. Which means you heard about the incident at the Norfair community center.”</p>
<p>“Yes. We talked to your reference about it. I imagine he talked to you?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t, but he’s busy and this interview happened on short notice,” I said. “Everything that unfolded there and a lot of what I see elsewhere, it suggests that it would be really hard to make it as an independent. Too many want to blame parahumans for what happened, and both independents and fledgling teams are easily targeted. Established teams absorb and diffuse that impact. That aside, being part of a team, cooperating, having the information and sharing that information, it’s too crucial. That’s why I’m not going independent, given the chance. I want to help build something.”</p>
<p>Countenance nodded. He reached over to his friend, who handed over the paperwork he’d been reading. He looked down. “Your reference sang your praises.”</p>
<p>“He’s a great guy. I really respect what he’s trying to do with something as tricky as the patrol block.”</p>
<p>“Our problem, when it comes to assessing any candidate, is that each person we add to our teams is added strength, added power, but they’re also a possible set of complications. It forces us to strike a balance. We’re smaller than many of our peers because we’re selective. We want to make sure anyone we add will be a good fit, with minimal complications.”</p>
<p>“I reached out to Foresight first, to <em>you</em>, because I like how you do things. It’s what and who I want to be.”</p>
<p>“Then my next question to you would be what you think is going to happen next,” Countenance said.</p>
<p>“What I think is going to happen? I think trouble is incoming. We see hints of it, the out-of-control triggers, we hear about some scary monsters and then the big names go and try to handle it, then we have other circumstances where the big names are running off to go handle things that they don’t tell anyone about. I think those situations might be worse than the monsters. So far, Gimel is untouched by the worst of it. We’ve been on top of things. But sooner or later, something is going to hit us that we aren’t prepared for and can’t neatly handle.”</p>
<p>“What do you think happens then?”</p>
<p>“I think it depends a lot on us having the right information and tools.”</p>
<p>Beside Countenance, Anelace was nodding. Anelace was a young guy, his costume the opposite of Countenance’s in how it was tighter-fitting, his mask bearing a dark gray dagger illustration on the right side of the white surface in the same exaggerated style the ‘4’ was drawn on the emblem on his chest. The knotted area where hilt, blade, and the two prongs of the guard all met was located where one of his eyes would be.</p>
<p>“You said you know how we operate?”</p>
<p>“Support work with the megalopolis and police, patrols and events for the day to day. Several times a week you make calculated, strategic strikes on priority targets. It’s like what the Wardens are doing with the big, scary threats, but you’re more city-focused than whatever’s going on outside of Gimel. A lot of your members go on to work with them, which is why you have openings.”</p>
<p>“She does her research,” Anelace said.</p>
<p>“She does,” Countenance said. He said it in a way that suggested he was admitting it, almost reluctant.</p>
<p>My heart sank.</p>
<p>I looked over my shoulder. The two at the side of the room were Effervescent and Relay.</p>
<p>Effervescent was an emotion manipulator with an emphasis on stunning people. Relay was capable of some complex moves with teleportation I wasn’t sure I had a grasp on, most of which seemed to amount to them teleporting to where others were, shunting that person to a random position elsewhere, and he also had some ability to communicate without words, both sending and receiving.</p>
<p>“Can I ask?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ask?” Countenance asked me.</p>
<p>I indicated the pair. “I get the impression they’re communicating something to you, and you sound like you’re winding up to tell me no. Both took some shifts at the portals, watching the refugees as they came in to make sure there was no trouble, which makes me think they’re thinkers, they read people, and they’re reading me.”</p>
<p>Countenance turned his head to fix the cyclopean, drawn eye on the pair.</p>
<p>“I can’t get a consistent read on you emotionally,” Effervescent said. “It’s repressed.”</p>
<p>“My long-time boyfriend was an emotion manipulator. He had a hard time getting a read on me too,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m better than most when it comes to getting reads,” Effervescent said. “No offense, but it’s what isn’t as repressed that concerns me.”</p>
<p>“Enough you’d say no,” Countenance said.</p>
<p>Effervescent nodded.</p>
<p>“Relay?”</p>
<p>“My read was fine. Minimal secondary noise.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Countenance said. “For reading you without permission. It’d be a point in your favor that you caught on, but&mdash;”</p>
<p>“But you have to put stock in what the others say. No hard feelings,” I said. I made myself smile as I stood from my seat. Countenance stood too. He shook my hand. “I’ll see you around, I hope we can work together then.”</p>
<p>“I hope so too. Good luck,” Countenance said.</p>
<p>“Let me get the door for you,” Anelace said. He jumped to his feet and opened the door for me. His voice was quiet as he said. “Sorry to see you go.”</p>
<p>The thinkers would have noticed that.</p>
<p>I wondered what Effervescent and Relay would be reporting about my emotional state as I left.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Mrs. Dallon?”</p>
<p>I stood from my seat in the waiting room.</p>
<p>The cape had a costume that looked like a suit, metallic silver fabric, with a black dress shirt underneath. His mask consisted of two panels that met and ran down the center of his face, creating an almost beak-like profile with how the two sides swept along the sides of his face and back. Not bird-like, but as if his entire head was the beak. The hair I could make out above the ‘v’ where the mask parted was longer and heavily styled.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the Ambassadors from Boston, but I was pretty sure they wouldn’t have worn suits as ostentatious as this, nor such a dramatic full-face mask.</p>
<p>“You didn’t come in costume?” he asked. He sounded surprised.</p>
<p>“I’m pre-identity adjustment,” I said, caught in trying to find my footing with my rehearsed explanation as I simultaneously crossed to where he was to shake his hand. “Moving on from the identity and methodology I had as a teenage heroine. I’m a blank slate, and there’s a lot of room to adjust my brand moving forward.”</p>
<p>“Are you ex-Protectorate?” he asked. “I might have missed that if it was in your application.”</p>
<p>“No. Ex-Ward, but only very briefly.”</p>
<p>“I only ask because you went straight to the term ‘brand’. I’m used to hearing it from people who were in the PRT and people from other corporate teams. I know I read your file and there was no mention of a corporate background. I’m Lark. You’ll meet Dido soon, all going well.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Lark.”</p>
<p>“My office is this way, if you’ll join me,” he said. He briefly touched the small of my back to guide me in the direction his other hand was indicating.</p>
<p>I was bothered by the contact. Unsolicited touching, the presumed closeness, and the fact it was a hot day, my back was damp from the walk and he would have felt that.</p>
<p>It was such an unnecessary thing and it made both of us uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Brockton Bay,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes. From birth to Endbringer and immediate aftermath.”</p>
<p>“A mom and pop small town team?”</p>
<p>“Aunt and uncle and cousins too,” I said. “Extended family. They passed the fifteen year mark with just donations and small events. I think that counts for something.”</p>
<p>“It’s better than what Dido and I have managed, but give us time. We have five parahumans on the team, and we’re already in the black when it comes to the business end of things.”</p>
<p>“I spent most of my childhood watching my mom balance the books, I did the events, the photoshoots, the merchandising as a PRT-acknowledged team. I have something of a sense of what you’re probably going for.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the merchandising. I think I have your PRT trading card from that time period in a binder in my office.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Which one? I had one that was holographic, which you could swipe through the controller for the video game to have me as a polygon-rendered helper, and the higher quality one that had the bio on the back.”</p>
<p>“I think it was the second one. My office is through this door.”</p>
<p>I took a seat opposite the glass-top desk while he closed the door. He undid the button in his suit jacket before sitting down.</p>
<p>“Typically those of us at Auzure like to work with new parahumans,” he said. “They’re easier to brand. When we work with capes with a history, we like that history to be a strong one.”</p>
<p>“I think you get the best of both worlds with me,” I said. “Most people assumed I was dead when everything happened in Brockton Bay, and nobody corrected that misunderstanding. If you do dig up information about me, a lot of it is strong.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s where we run into problems,” he said. “A lot of your history and presence is tied into your family’s group identity. ‘Glory Girl’ isn’t famous beyond a certain range. Hometown heroine, yes, with some people in Boston and New York who might know of you, but not famous.”</p>
<p>“Then consider me new. Untainted by the past.”</p>
<p>“I would, but we use things we term perception turns, or just turns.”</p>
<p>“I know the term,” I said.</p>
<p>“I like that you do. Branding, turns. You do seem to know what you’re getting into here. When we’re tracking someone’s marketability, we map out the turns. You’re fine, nothing exceptional, for most of your career, with an upturn if you count your disappearance, after the Slaughterhouse Nine.”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath, then nodded.</p>
<p>“But if we include your family, there’s a lot of baggage.”</p>
<p>“You could say that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Downturn, death of Fleur. Downturn, times when New Wave was subsisting, but not in the eyes of the media.”</p>
<p>“Four adolescents and two couples, there were weeks where school or work took priority. That got better as my cousins and I got older.”</p>
<p>“Cousins… and your sister?” he asked.</p>
<p>I felt the shock like it was cold water.</p>
<p>He continued, “I think if it were up to the turns and the background alone, it would have to be a no. At the time you should have been drawing the most attention, given your age and potential, you… died, as you put it. You were gone for the two years before Gold Morning.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re offering cape services for the reconstruction, with Spell offering some massive assistance with the argriculture. It’s a big part of what’s driving us to the front pages, giving us some upturn in the most general sense, for public perception. What we really want is the human angle, something where we could have an attractive young lady like yourself in a photo op, or your sister&mdash;”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>“Her and the right person in a photograph? If you two paired up, Auzure could make you big.”</p>
<p>I winced, and I stood from my seat.</p>
<p>“Victoria?”</p>
<p>They hadn’t accepted the interview to get me for <em>me</em>. I was just a stepping stone to the person they really wanted.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your time,” I said.</p>
<p>I managed to restrain myself from slamming the door on the way out.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Thanks for meeting us out here,” Whorl said. He didn’t shake my hand, but instead reached out to clasp my wrist. I clasped his.</p>
<p>“Not a problem,” I said. I looked up at the structure that had been erected around the portal. It cast a shadow. “It’s nice to be in the shade, with a decent breeze.”</p>
<p>Whorl wore a blue mask with a white border around the eyes and outermost edge, and his costume was a ‘preppy’ bodysuit, complete with a folded collar, like a polo shirt, a narrow belt, and leggings. His icon was large on his chest, a circle with angled spokes at the edges. He had an armband with the gold morning symbol on it, but the colors were the blue and white of his costume.</p>
<p>He grinned, showing off white teeth. “You should have been here at noon. It was brutal.”</p>
<p>“The people weren’t too irritable, with the heat?”</p>
<p>All around us, people were coming through the portal, forming lines. There were buildings to the left and right of the street that people were heading into, to get the instructions and things necessary to start their lives in Gimel.</p>
<p>“I think they were happy for it,” Whorl said. “I’ve been going back and forth, and it’s miserable on the other side.”</p>
<p>“I just realized I got us started on a conversation about the weather,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m kind of a weather manipulator, not really, but it’s fun to say. Talking about the weather happens more than you’d think, when it comes to me,” he said.</p>
<p>Again, that smile with those very white teeth.</p>
<p>“I read up on you online,” I said.</p>
<p>“Ah, did you? Should I be flattered or worried that I’ve been stalked?”</p>
<p>I was reminded of the segment on television, the reporter trying to corner Chevalier by getting him to claim a certain attitude.</p>
<p>“It’s not stalking,” I said. “I’m doing my homework, is all.”</p>
<p>I had to admit, the preppy look with the wide shoulders, narrow waist, clean cut and nicely taken care of, it appealed to me, and it had always. Not that I was even remotely thinking of actually moving forward with a relationship.</p>
<p>“I’m probably going to have to duck out and handle some minor crisis or another, but stick around and don’t disappear on me, we’ll find the time and figure out if we can place you with the Attendant.”</p>
<p>“That’d be great.”</p>
<p>“If I get caught up in something, find one of the others. Chat with them, they’ll tell you what they think of the team.”</p>
<p>There were a few other capes distributed across the crowd. It was interesting how people seemed so keen on them, even approaching them, happy to see them. The sentiment of blame hadn’t gripped the refugees here.</p>
<p>A teenager with a moon design on her mask and dress-like costume.</p>
<p>I saw a humanoid mech the size of a car, with a glass tank for the ‘body’, something large and fishlike within the tank. The mech sat on its ass, feet sticking out, and children were crowding around to tap the glass and climb on the feet. The tinker, as I took it, was the one sitting on the suit’s shoulder. Another cape was standing on the end of a rod, three stories above the ground, the end of the rod stuck into the side of the building. He looked stern as he looked down at the scene, his arms folded, until someone waved up at him and he waved back.</p>
<p>“Is that the whole team?”</p>
<p>“Not even close. With the teams merging, we’re taking on a lot of others. We’ll be breaking up into three sub-teams later, but all with the same name and brand.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’m hurting my chances saying this, but I’m kind of crossing my fingers you guys are going with the Shepherd’s name and brand, but the Attendant’s approach.”</p>
<p>Whorl smiled again. “We might be.”</p>
<p>“I like the approach,” I said.</p>
<p>“How do you interpret it?”</p>
<p>“Giving people security. Moving slowly, with measured steps, informed by the lessons of the past. You guys seem pretty focused on taking and holding territories, improving neighborhoods. After what happened at the Norfair community center, I think giving people time to get used to capes again is key.”</p>
<p>“I think it might be,” Whorl said.</p>
<p>Above, the cape that was standing on the end of the horizontal pole whistled. As we looked up, he pointed.</p>
<p>“That’s my cue,” Whorl said. “No pun intended. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>Whorl headed toward the building that the people were filing out of, moving at a light jog, with a fog-like nimbus building at his shoulders and arms.</p>
<p>I looked at the various capes, debating my options. I worried that flying up to say hello to the one at the end of the pole would spook him and make him fall from his roost, and I wasn’t that keen on flying.</p>
<p>That left two options. The tinker or the teenage girl with the moon iconography.</p>
<p>I made my way toward the girl, because she had less people around her. The crowd was a bit of a tide I had to work against.</p>
<p>“Stuck?” I heard a voice.</p>
<p>I turned my head. It was a man with tattoos, a cleft chin and eyes that looked like he was perpetually squinting, even in the shade of the gate that housed the Bet-Gimel portal. He was talking to a couple.</p>
<p>“It’s a big decision. We’re not farmers.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard, getting started again,” the guy with the tattoos said. “The tent cities are rough, while you wait for an available apartment. You can work your ass off, earn fake ‘dollars’ that might not have value in a few weeks or months, you sweat, you hurt, and everyone around you is doing the same. Stinks, when everyone’s working that hard and getting only a few minutes to shower.”</p>
<p>“We’ve heard of things like that.”</p>
<p>“If you want another option, we’ve got a settlement at Canaan. Small city, even. Or a big town. We’ve got extra rooms, food, and dangerously strong alcohol. We’re still trying to figure that out.”</p>
<p>I heard the rustle of papers.</p>
<p>“Canaan?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Have you been?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard stories,” I said. I turned to the couple, “I’m ninety percent sure the Canaan area is Fallen territory. Outskirts of the megalopolis.”</p>
<p>“We’re not really holding fast to all of that anymore,” the guy with the tattoos said. “We said the world would end, we tried to draw attention to it, the world ended, we were right. Now we make the best of things.”</p>
<p>“That seems like a pretty skewed take,” I said.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes as he looked away from me. He turned back to the couple. “You have the directions. Easy to catch a bus to New Haven, catch another bus to the Hartford Stretch. Go to the address, we almost always have someone with a ride waiting there for the buses, to drive you into Canaan. The hard work has been done, it’s easier, it’s more fun, and there’s actual community. It’s one of the things that’s strangely missing from most parts in this city. You’ll notice that.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” the guy from the couple said. “I’ll keep this.”</p>
<p>“McVeay, Crowley, or Mathers?” I asked.</p>
<p>The guy shot me an annoyed look. “What?”</p>
<p>“Which family branch were or are you?” I asked. I turned to the couple. “Three branches, each loosely themed after one of the Endbringers. There was a nascent fourth in twenty-thirteen that was based on one or all of the other three, but I missed the memo on that.”</p>
<p>“Crowley,” the guy said. “We were the jackasses.”</p>
<p>“McVeays were the ultra-religious, more violent ones, loosely themed after Behemoth,” I said. “Mathers were the ones themed after the Simurgh. They’re still around too, they did a lot of the kidnappings of kids and capes, with intent to force marriages. Then you have the Crowleys, who were a little bit more than jackasses. Stirring panic, scaring people, violence.”</p>
<p>“To draw attention to the imminent end of the world,” the guy with the tattoos said. “Do you want us to apologize for trying to get people’s attention and failing? Or should we not have tried? We were <em>right.</em>”</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice. I thought it was the girl with the moons on her costume. It wasn’t. Another woman with tattoos, with friends. One of the tattoos was of a bat-winged schlong. Another was of a cartoon character I didn’t recognize getting spit-roasted, in the metal pole, open fire sense.</p>
<p>She had others, but I couldn’t see enough of them to tell what they were. I could guess they were similarly tasteful. Her top was tied at the sternum, exposing ribs and stomach.</p>
<p>“Just a bit of one,” I said. “You guys are openly recruiting from this crowd here?”</p>
<p>“Recruiting is an strange way to put it,” the guy with the tattoos said.</p>
<p>I looked at the couple. “If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Free rent, free food, drinks, company?”</p>
<p>“Cheap rent,” the woman with the tattoos said. “A lot of people stay just long enough to make some extra money while commuting to Hartford and paying rent to us.”</p>
<p>“All we ask is that people who decide to go make sure to tell people that hey, we aren’t assholes,” the tattooed guy said.</p>
<p>“We aren’t assholes!” the burly guys who were keeping the woman company cheered in near-unison.</p>
<p>“Which Crowley is in charge?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Hey, bitch,” the woman said. “Just move on. Fuck off.”</p>
<p>The cheering had drawn attention. The teenage girl with the moons on her costume approached, ducking beneath one of the burly guy’s arms. She spotted me, saw that last exchange, and drew close to me, putting one hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“You’re the one Whorl was talking to?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Take it from me, it’s not worth it. Come on.”</p>
<p>The guy with the tattoos smirked.</p>
<p>“You know they’re recruiting here, right?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We know,” she said. “We’ve drawn attention to it. We were told to keep out of it, so long as they behave.”</p>
<p>She put pressure on my shoulder, urging me to move. I took one step back.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to let this go. I would have more regrets if I walked away.</p>
<p>“Which Crowley?” I asked. “There were three brothers and one sister, last I heard.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter,” the tattooed guy said.</p>
<p>“Eldest brother was a murderer, got ousted from the family for that, back in twenty-eleven, when the Fallen were still minor. But around the time their numbers swelled in twenty-twelve, early twenty-thirteen, he got accepted back, head of the Crowley branch. He killed two of his own family members after that. I think that matters a lot, since if he’s in charge, you can’t really call yourselves mere jackasses.”</p>
<p>“Not him.”</p>
<p>There were a few more faces appearing in the crowd. Unfriendly.</p>
<p>The girl with the moon design leaned in close, murmuring in my ear, “They have someone with powers in the crowd. They send people out to fish for recruits, and if there’s trouble, they have these reinforcements summoned into the middle of the crowd and they’ll shout you down.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “Middle brother and the sister were pretty skeevy too. They didn’t kidnap anyone directly, but they networked with the other families, gave shelter to some McVeays who needed to duck the attention of the law, and they traded a few of their family members for some of the kidnapped minors and capes the Mathers family had. I’d be concerned about going to <em>that</em> camp.”</p>
<p>“The little brother,” the guy with the tattoos said.</p>
<p>“The party animal,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s what we’re about!” were the shouts. There was more of a raucous response from the other reinforcements. Cries and shouts of ‘party’. People throughout the crowd were looking.</p>
<p>“He’ll try to steal your girlfriend before he makes you welcome!” I had to raise my voice to be heard. The people who were pushing forward made it harder for me to see the couple. “It’s not worth it. You can look him up at a library. Jake Crowley! Four wives, all half his age!”</p>
<p>There were shouts and bellows of denial, a few swears directed my way. One ‘cunt’, from someone close enough to have punched me if he’d felt the desire.</p>
<p>“Throw away the paper,” I called out. “It’s not worth it!”</p>
<p>With the press of bodies, I didn’t see the paper get thrown away. But I saw the guy hugging his girlfriend closer, I saw the fractional nod.</p>
<p>That was all I got. The moon girl pushed me harder, and I allowed myself to be pushed this time.</p>
<p>I walked backward out of the crowd, looking at the group. They were still making a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Whorl was waiting for me as I made my exit from the thicker part of the crowd. The mech tinker was standing on the head of his suit, now, and the suit was standing too, which gave him a decent vantage point overlooking everything.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take an hour before they settle down,” Whorl said. “What was that about?”</p>
<p>“Fallen recruiters,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know that much.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to make sure the people they were talking to knew,” I said. “Told them who the family was, how they operated, who the leader was.”</p>
<p>“You think they listened?” Moon girl asked.</p>
<p>“They might have,” I said. “I didn’t get the impression I was going to start a riot, so I thought I’d be okay trying.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Whorl said, “Your impression was fine. No riot. They know to keep their hands to themselves, and just to be loud. They stick to the rules so they can keep coming back. We were told to let them, which sucks, but we have to work with the authorities.”</p>
<p>“I told her that,” Moon girl said. “That we were supposed to leave it be.”</p>
<p>“Before or after she stirred them up?”</p>
<p>“Before,” I answered for her. “I knew, I went ahead anyway.”</p>
<p>Whorl frowned.</p>
<p>“I knew it would probably cost me my spot on the team,” I said.</p>
<p>Whorl nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“But if it stops one person from going over to that town of theirs… I guess it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>“It might have worked,” Whorl said, “But they’ve got the reinforcements, they’ll double down. They’ll try harder, make up for it.”</p>
<p>“You guys are all about learning from the mistakes of the past,” I said. “Paying respect to the casualties. You have to know they can’t be allowed to get a foothold. They’re too monstrous, and the people they’re going after are too vulnerable.”</p>
<p>“They have a foothold already,” he said. “We’re the guys who failed to stop the end of the world, and they’re the ones who were right about it. To some people that’s all that matters. It doesn’t matter that they’re scumbags or that they’re dangerous. Not everyone, but even one out of every thirty is a lot.”</p>
<p>“We should go calm things down,” Moon girl said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Whorl said. “Distract the people from the tattooed hooligans.”</p>
<p>“Good luck with that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Take care, Victoria. Keep fighting the good fight, whatever you end up doing.”</p>
<p>I gave him a two finger salute.</p>
<p>I braced myself, both in balance and emotionally, then took to the air, moving slowly. I raised myself up to the same level as the guy at the end of the pole, staying within his field of vision so I wouldn’t surprise him.</p>
<p>They were using the powers to teleport people in. I couldn’t see where the fade-in happened or where the teleportation destination was, but as the crowd shuffled, there were more of the people with tattoos, trashy people, and people that didn’t look like refugees.</p>
<p>The guy on the end of the pole pointed. I moved closer to him, and followed the line of his arm and finger to see.</p>
<p>A man with a daughter, sitting on a blanket at the base of a fence.</p>
<p>“The girl or the man?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The man. He’s the one bringing them in. Keeps the kid close as a shield, in case someone catches on. Different kids, some days.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I think every day of going over there and taking him out of the picture. Letting him know I know.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t be worth it,” I said.</p>
<p>The noises of the crowd of Fallen increased, a fresh chant. Heads were turning and people were smiling, because they didn’t know, and positivity and high energy meant a lot when they were as tired and despondent as they were. Some would have spent a long time waiting for their chance to come through.</p>
<p>A dangerous and vulnerable thing, to have no place to go.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap20">Flare &mdash; 2.2</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>There was something to be said about the fact that the hospital was still in construction while it was running. There were patients in the waiting room, sitting in the chairs that had been bolted to the floor, and the unhappiness of needing a hospital visit was compounded by the fact that a third of the way across the room, behind a plastic sheet that had been taped to walls, ceiling and floor, a team was using power tools and calling out in loud voices as they built the rest of the room.</p>
<p>The hospital staff looked pretty miserable too, most of them sequestered on the other side of a counter, walled off from the patients by a plexiglass window. Security guards stood off to one side.</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” a secretary asked.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if it was possible for me to see a patient?”</p>
<p>“Visiting hours are open. Patient’s name?”</p>
<p>“Fume Hood. I don’t know her real name.”</p>
<p>The secretary stopped, then looked at the male secretary, who sat at the other end of the counter. She looked past him at the security guard.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>“I was one of the people giving her medical attention when the ambulance arrived,” I said. I knew it wouldn’t matter, that they would assume I’d been lying, but I hoped it would temper the reaction.</p>
<p>“She’s not accepting visitors,” the secretary said.</p>
<p>“One second,” I heard. A female voice.</p>
<p>Two overlapping sections of the plastic sheet peeled apart. Tempera ducked through, and put the tacky sides of the plastic back together. She was dusty from plaster and streaked with paint that wasn’t from her power. She wore overalls, a black t-shirt for a top, and had a different pattern to the paint she’d applied over her eyes with fingers, more like she had applied it to her fingers and pressed them to her eyes as a series of vertical bars, each bleeding into the one beside it.</p>
<p>“Hi, Victoria,” she said to me.</p>
<p>“Hi.”</p>
<p>She looked at the secretary, “We know her. Can I take her back to the room?”</p>
<p>“Let me get her information, and I’ll buzz you two through.”</p>
<p>I took the clipboard with the paperwork, and I filled out the information, checking my phone to remind myself of the specifics of Crystal’s address. She took the clipboard, read it over, and let us through.</p>
<p>We walked down the back halls of the hospital, past individual clinics and their signs and separate waiting areas, past patient rooms and nurse’s stations. Tempera indicated the turns. We didn’t rush it, an unspoken agreement that we’d take our time, have a chance to talk.</p>
<p>“There was one attempt on her life. We were worried there would be another,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“Are you standing guard?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I am keeping an eye on things, but mostly by accident. I’ve been helping with the construction. I like getting my hands dirty,” Tempera said. She smiled as she held up one hand, which was covered in wet white ‘paint’ down to the elbow, the paint turning black before transitioning to her light brown skin. “Look at you, though. You look tidy.”</p>
<p>Tidy. It was an amusing choice of words, when Tempera looked anything but. I smiled. “Looking around to see if any teams are looking to fill positions.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Only one was actually posting any openings, a corporate team, Auzure. Foresight and the Attendant were open to interviewing me. There are two other big teams; one gave me a hard no, and the other is folding into the Attendant and won’t exist soon, they didn’t give me a response yet, and with how the talk with the Attendant went, I don’t think it’d work out.”</p>
<p>“They’re pretty conservative. In a lot of respects. A lot of the religious capes went to the Shepherds and will be part of the Attendant. I’ve been paying close attention to that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “One or two of the sketchy people from Empire Eighty-Eight, too.”</p>
<p>“Empire Eighty-Eight? They sound familiar.”</p>
<p>“They had a presence for a while. A few years back they broke up into two other groups. The Pure and Fenrir’s Chosen.”</p>
<p>“Ah. I know the Chosen. They were linked to the Clans, I think?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Clans spread out across multiple cities, and would funnel anyone who got powers over to the Empire Eighty-Eight core group, back before Leviathan broke the group’s back. They were a background element in my childhood and cape career.”</p>
<p>“Ahh. Was that a factor in your wanting to join?”</p>
<p>A very carefully neutral question, that. I wondered if she was prodding me, not declaring a stance while feeling me out. I was still an unknown, in a way.</p>
<p>“Violent racists on the team? Definitely a factor, big point against. Question is, are they <em>ex</em>-violent, ex-racists? Gets muddier. Even then, I might draw the line there, and not join. If they were contrite? I could roll with that, I think. Barring one or two especially scummy individuals. Interview didn’t get far enough for me to raise the subject.”</p>
<p>Tempera nodded, not saying anything.</p>
<p>“I think… maybe I’m being unsubtle, saying it, but I think there’s a big difference between who those guys were and who Fume Hood is.”</p>
<p>“I think so too.”</p>
<p>“How is she?”</p>
<p>“She’s hurt by what happened. It’s hard, to put yourself out there, face your shortcomings, try to be better, and get shot for it.”</p>
<p>“Partial facing of shortcomings, from what she and I talked about,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s why I said face, instead of ‘admit’,” Tempera said. “But I don’t want to quibble. Change of subject. You said your meeting went badly. Can I ask what happened?”</p>
<p>“Fallen,” I said.</p>
<p>“Did you get in another fight?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. I sighed. “No. They did what they often do, they caused a disruption, and that’s a playing field that suits them well. I’d call it a draw, but I’m pretty sure they’re still out there recruiting and I’m not out there counteracting that.”</p>
<p>“There will always be bad guys. They will always be out there. There will always be murders, there will be theft, there will be drugs.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Question is,” Tempera said, “Where do you want to be, in relation to that, as it happens?”</p>
<p>“That is a deceptively tricky question,” I said.</p>
<p>“You definitely put yourself out there, backing us up when things went sideways at the community center.”</p>
<p>“I really appreciate that you see it that way,” I said.</p>
<p>“You put yourself in front of Lord of Loss. I don’t know how your power works, but it’s obvious you can bleed. There was some danger there.”</p>
<p>I acknowledged that with a small nod.</p>
<p>“And now you’re interviewing for teams? So soon after? It sounds like you want to be out there, helping.”</p>
<p>“I do. I’m zero for three, though.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to be independent? Hold on a second. We’re nearly at the room, but let’s finish talking before we go in.”</p>
<p>We stopped midway down the hallway. A nurse’s station was a short distance away.</p>
<p>“I&mdash;” I started. “I think, the way things are going, I might end up going that way. Teams are a complication of their own.”</p>
<p>“They are,” Tempera said. “I had a phone call earlier, offering a position. I can go right there and sign the paperwork if I want to.”</p>
<p>“With?”</p>
<p>“The Attendant, as it happens,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>I was momentarily lost for words. She’d been doing what I’d thought, inviting me to answer without declaring a position, but from a different angle.</p>
<p>“I want to wait and see how the merger with the Shepherds shakes up, how it feels after, they said not to wait too long. It’s decent money, decent exposure. A lot of decency.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let what I said change your mind on anything. I’m griping, it’s&mdash;”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” she said. “I invited you to gripe, if we’re going to use your word. It’s interesting to hear that take on them. I didn’t know about the racist ex-villains joining. I’m curious about how they handled the Fallen there, too, in your situation.”</p>
<p>“I think, uh, don’t tell them I said this…”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“…I think they or the people they’re taking guidance from are approaching that stance of there always being bad guys to deal with, and they’re deciding to conserve their energy. To not fight that fight. Maybe it’s right to.”</p>
<p>“You got a draw. That’s better than a win for the bad guys there.”</p>
<p>“It’s&mdash; yeah,” I said. “I tried to use reason, draw on the stuff I studied, old knowledge I had about the group. Who they were, how they operate, the families, the names. Put that information out there, so the potential recruits would know the key facts. I tried to get them to say who their leader was, pressed the issue, and of course it was the least bad one, so the argument I was gunning for didn’t have much clout, and I lost steam.”</p>
<p>“I picture the Fallen as a group that’s pretty comfortable defying reason.”</p>
<p>“Them, yes. The recruits, I think they were open to hearing it. I threw out some more information I remembered at the last second, but the Fallen were getting pretty loud, I didn’t want to start a riot, and that was more or less it.”</p>
<p>“And the Attendant?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t keen on me making a point of things when the word from on high was to let the Fallen be. I didn’t get my invite to the team.”</p>
<p>Tempera made a face.</p>
<p>“I don’t like ignoring the monsters. And I do think the Fallen are monstrous, as a collective force.”</p>
<p>“They’re a headache I was always glad I wouldn’t have to deal with,” Tempera said. She scratched her nose as she scrunched it up, the paint there highlighting the creases. The scratching deposited more paint on the bridge. “One I guess I’ll have to prepare myself for dealing with. Or possibly <em>not</em> dealing with, if I take the Attendant’s offer.”</p>
<p>“Possibly,” I said. “Don’t give my words too much weight.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to be sensible about it. I might end up asking those questions you didn’t get a chance to, if that’s okay.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll be okay, whatever happens. The Wardens facilitated Attendant’s contact with me, and from their tone, I think they’d push to get me on another team if I didn’t go with that one.”</p>
<p>“That’s great,” I said.</p>
<p>“I could put in a word for you.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say no,” I said. “I don’t think I’ll get my hopes up, either.”</p>
<p>Tempera frowned.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I didn’t mean to sound negative.”</p>
<p>“Are you finding your way, with these setbacks?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Complicated. Just wanted to check in on Fume Hood, while things are quiet. When the law or the system fail to outline a process, do what seems right. When it’s not clear what’s right, go with the law. When neither is clear, reach out.”</p>
<p>“For perspective?”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “That too. More eyes on a problem never hurts.”</p>
<p>“Another point for the team, instead of going independent,” Tempera said. She looked back down the hall, in the direction we’d been walking to. “Hold on a moment? I’ll check if she’s decent. I wouldn’t mind bringing Fume Hood into it, now that we’re past the semi-confidential stuff about other teams.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She touched the wall by the door as she rounded the corner, stepping into the room, and she knocked on the door as she entered.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause. The handprint of paint on the wall dropped to the floor with a splat as Tempera said, “Come in.”</p>
<p>The blob of paint on the door fell to the ground as well. Both moved along the ground as I entered, spattering against the back of Tempera’s shoes and the back of her overalls.</p>
<p>Fume Hood had donned a mask, but she didn’t wear the hood. She lay down on the bed, which was angled so she could sit up at an angle. A blanket had been pulled up to her waist, covering her legs.</p>
<p>Crystalclear sat in the chair between her and the window, the crystal configuration on his head slightly different than before. He wore a t-shirt and shorts. There was something odd about a guy with crystals where his eyes and hair would be having very ordinary hairy legs.</p>
<p>“Heya,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I said.</p>
<p>“Hey, patrol girl with a name I can’t remember,” Fume Hood said.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Tempera volunteered.</p>
<p>“Victoria. Right. Thank you for helping to hold my blood in,” Fume Hood said.</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome,” I said. I noted the flowers and cards sitting beneath the window. “Sorry I didn’t bring anything. This is my awkward ‘I was in the neighborhood’ visit. I saw the hospital name and remembered you were brought out this way.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got too much as it is. Turns out that the key to popularity and acceptance is to get yourself shot.”</p>
<p>Her tone was light, almost amused. Tempera had said Fume Hood was hurt on an emotional level, but I didn’t see a sign of it. I could remember how Tempera had acted on my first meeting with her, how in tune with her team she had been. I was willing to put a lot of stock in her take on things.</p>
<p>“Victoria, what I was going to say, before deciding I’d rather say it here, was that we’re going our separate ways, yes&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Longscratch is already gone,” Crystalclear said. “But I don’t think he was ever going to stick around on a permanent basis.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Tempera said. “Which is a shame. I do hope he finds what he’s looking for. My point is, I don’t want to lose touch. It’s helpful and nice that Crystalclear happened to be here to help illustrate that maintenance of contact.”</p>
<p>“Happy to take credit,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“Victoria said&mdash; if you don’t mind me repeating?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“She said that it’s important to reach out, if I’m recalling that right. I’d like to stay friends with you,” Tempera said. “Crystalclear, Fume Hood. Victoria, you too.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Fume Hood asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Tempera asked.</p>
<p>“We’re very different people,” Fume Hood said. “I don’t get how that works. How do you stay in touch with people you have very little in common with?”</p>
<p>“Easy. Grab a bite sometime,” I said. “Sandwich, beer or soda, share stories, get different perspectives. I wouldn’t mind.”</p>
<p>“That’d be nice,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“But&mdash;” Fume Hood started. She frowned. “Okay, whatever.”</p>
<p>“You should find the words for what you’re trying to say,” I said. “In case it festers or gets in the way.”</p>
<p>“I dunno. I don’t get why you’re here. I’m grateful, don’t get me wrong. You put pressure on my wound, Tempera gave me first aid and used her paint to keep me from dying. I probably owe you my lives. But that whole fiasco was my fault.”</p>
<p>“I blame the attacking villains, not you,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“Yep,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to be clever and get me to keep being a hero, then?” Fume Hood asked.</p>
<p>“I’m here because I was interested in how you were doing,” I said. “Obviously I’d prefer it if you stayed a hero, but that’s not the objective.”</p>
<p>“If you guys keep showing up with flowers or to make small talk, you make it awfully hard for me to fuck off and go back to being a villain.”</p>
<p>“That’s a plus,” Tempera said. “But like Victoria said, it’s not the main point.”</p>
<p>“On the topic of pluses,” I said, “I’m interested in who those guys were. So if you hear anything, I wouldn’t mind a heads up.”</p>
<p>“The guy who shot me did so of sound mind, no Kingdom Come in play. Independent, apparently. No money in his accounts, he didn’t have internet. He was just pissed off.”</p>
<p>“There were the villains, too,” I said.</p>
<p>“There were.”</p>
<p>“And we don’t know what they were after,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“Multiple conflicting stories,” I said. “Blindside lied to me when I asked. It bothers me, and I worry it’ll happen again.”</p>
<p>“Give me your cell phone number,” Tempera said. “I’ll get in touch.”</p>
<p>There was a brief pause while we sorted things out, me getting the contact information from each of the others, and giving them mine. They already knew each other.</p>
<p>Reaching out, making and maintaining contact.</p>
<p>A part of me had hoped that Fume Hood was wrong, that the team wouldn’t have dissolved, that they’d be together, willing to give things another try. That it might have been a team I could join.</p>
<p>“The cards and flowers might have something to do with how you’re the topic of the moment,” I mused aloud.</p>
<p>“I heard something about that,” Fume Hood said, indicating Crystalclear.</p>
<p>“From me,” Crystalclear volunteered unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“If you guys were to try again, there could be more attention, more support,” I said.</p>
<p>“More gunshots?” Fume Hood asked. “I’m stepping down and going into hiding. I’ll recuperate, let the heat die down, and then figure out what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>“If it matters, I think more people are siding with you than not,” I said.</p>
<p>Fume Hood nodded a few times, taking that in. “Weird.”</p>
<p>“It’s good,” Tempera said. “I think Crystalclear already accepted the offer from Foresight, though.”</p>
<p>“It was a very promising offer.”</p>
<p>“And I’ve been contacted by Attendant. I don’t know what I’ll do with that. And Victoria&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Is not having much luck,” I said. “But I want to do something.”</p>
<p>“You were thinking you might go independent?”</p>
<p>“Which doesn’t pay,” I said. “Not in this environment.”</p>
<p>“How does that work?” Fume Hood asked. “If you’re a crook, it’s easy, you take jobs at the villain bar, or you rob some place, or any number of things. You just… go out on patrol?”</p>
<p>“There are a few other things to do,” I said. “One way is to essentially run a protection racket that isn’t a racket. It’s easy for that to go wrong. There’s a higher level effect, which is easier to pull off when, say, a city has a downtown area and the shop owners gather together to pay a wage to the hero that draws attention and has a positive influence on their area…”</p>
<p>“Things have to be stable before that happens,” Tempera said.</p>
<p>“We’re not there yet,” I said. “There’s training and support. Offering powers for helping with the rebuilding, which Auzure was doing a bit of. There’s merchandising, but that’s a dead market right now, I think.”</p>
<p>“We fished in that pond prior to getting underway and we didn’t get any bites,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“I was selling my brain, I know a lot about capes and the community, having grown up with it. That job’s done, and I don’t know if there’s much more opportunity for that.”</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” Tempera said. “I’ll put out feelers. See what people say.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Sure. Thank you.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I was lost in thought enough that my retracing of my steps on the way out of the hospital turned me in circles. I approached the same nurse’s station for a second time, and I stopped at the desk, waiting for someone with a spare moment to give me directions.</p>
<p>I wanted to do <em>something.</em></p>
<p>There weren’t any openings. I was pretty sure Advance Guard had turned me down because of my background, the two year gap prior to Gold Morning. Others had their reasons for rejecting me. As it was, the field was fairly cluttered. Villains were keeping their heads down. As much as there was always going to be the bad guys, like Tempera had said, we didn’t have the systems in place to identify them or address them.</p>
<p>No way to make money off of my powers, to pay the rent and get out of Crystal’s borderline uncomfortably cluttered place.</p>
<p>“Yes?” a nurse asked.</p>
<p>I blinked. I didn’t ask her for directions. My thoughts went in another direction, spurred to life by my thoughts of the unpaid cape work.</p>
<p>“If I said ‘crisis points’, would that mean anything to you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since I heard that. Yes, it means something. Do you work with capes?”</p>
<p>“I… kind of am a cape. Would you be open to me giving you a hand?”</p>
<p>“Let me look into it. I’m not sure what the usual methods are, and it’s not fresh in my mind.”</p>
<p>“You’d want to identify the key patients, check with any parents, if they’re under eighteen, and they often are. Then with me, you’d want to check with legal, you can call my references, which I do have on hand…”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The mask wasn’t the quality sort I was used to, more of a Halloween costume. The top I wore was a men’s small, a little too big in the shoulder, while it simultaneously squashed my chest.</p>
<p>From the ages of the patients in the pediatric wing, I wasn’t sure they would pay much mind to my chest, squashed or not. Most were twelve or younger. A few heads turned, people paying cursory attention.</p>
<p>I still wore the skirt I’d worn to the interviews, the belt.</p>
<p>Room 5, bed C.</p>
<p>I entered room five. There were four beds, one in each corner. One monitor was beeping, the other kids were lying down, looking bored.</p>
<p>Bed C was a little girl, with a face chock full of freckles, and sandy blonde hair. The curtains had been partially closed, blocking the views of the boy sitting to her left and the girl sitting across from her.</p>
<p>“Audrey?” I asked, peering in.</p>
<p>I saw only a glimpse of misery on her expression, while she stared off out the window. Then she raised her head and the expression was gone. She assessed me, head to toe.</p>
<p>“Great,” she said, after she was done.</p>
<p>“Great?”</p>
<p>“Ooh, yay, it’s Legend, except he’s a girl now,” she said, sarcastic.</p>
<p>The t-shirt I wore was styled after Legend’s costume. The mask was the same. Something the staff had kept on hand from the past Halloween.</p>
<p>“The nurses pointed me your way,” I said.</p>
<p>“Well, my day sucked, but now fake Lady Legend is here, so I’m all better. That’s great.”</p>
<p>“I can take the mask off if you want,” I said.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, you can’t do that, fake Lady Legend. Your secret identity might be compromised!”</p>
<p>The sarcasm ran strong through this one.</p>
<p>I pulled the curtain closed a bit more, then pulled off the mask, flying a bit as I said, “I never really had the secret identity.”</p>
<p>With that, at least, her eyebrows went up. No smart retort. She moved around her hospital bed, craning her head to see my feet, trying to spot the trick.</p>
<p>“I don’t know you,” she said.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter,” I said. “The nurses mentioned you’d had an especially bad day.”</p>
<p>Again, that momentary look of misery.</p>
<p>Yeah, I knew that.</p>
<p>“Back before everything turned sour, when I’d come to the hospital, with, um&mdash;” I stopped, drew in a breath, and sighed. “It’s something heroes would do. Check in on people who had really bad days. And when I came to the hospital, sometimes I’d do that.”</p>
<p>Crisis points. More a PRT thing than a New Wave thing, but we’d done a small share. Looking out for the recent triggers, putting our faces and names out there, staying in touch with the public.</p>
<p>“A nurse sat down with me for a while,” she said. “No offense, I appreciate it, but I’m kind of talked out.”</p>
<p>“Instead of talking, um,” I said. I showed her what was in my hand, letting the straps dangle. “What would you say about going flying?”</p>
<p>I saw her eyes go wide.</p>
<p>“The hospital called your dad’s work. He said it was okay.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>My feet left the hospital rooftop. Flying was unwieldy, especially with my burden. I was untrained. Having the benefit of my forcefield to protect me in the event of a crash would mean having my forcefield up, and that had other connotations, with my power as distorted as it was, the fact that I couldn’t necessarily control the movements or know what they would do. Not doable, when I held someone.</p>
<p>There was uncertainty too. The source of that flight, it had never let me down, but if push came to shove, in a crisis, would my maneuvering be sloppier? Would I decelerate or accelerate in a different way? I’d carelessly trusted my power, once, and now I wasn’t sure I could. I knew what the source of that power was, now, and what its goals were.</p>
<p>It was emotionally heavy, even as I felt almost weightless physically, to be reminded of what had changed so dramatically.</p>
<p>I could feel my charge’s intake of breath, as I held one arm across her lower ribs. I didn’t trust the harness we’d grabbed from the physio center. Not enough to hold someone for me. She was strapped with her back to my front.</p>
<p>The ground was a good ways below us now. I hadn’t even ascended that fast. I’d been a little lost in thought.</p>
<p>I felt her laugh, nervous and small, while I turned us around, giving her a view of the area. Norfair and its community center was off in the distance, one way. The farms were off in another direction. From here, it was easy to see the tall buildings of the city, the places that looked like a slice of the old world. To look to the fringes of those areas, where the tents and shoddily erected structures stretched off, so endless it seemed they reached to the horizon.</p>
<p>“I got you,” I said, in answer to the nervous giggles. Had I laughed like that, on my first real flight?</p>
<p>“Yeah,” was the response, a small, quiet voice. Then more giggles.</p>
<p>The giggle became laughter on her part, borderline hysterical.</p>
<p>“You okay?”</p>
<p>She nodded, fast and fierce, then drew in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Wooooooooo!” she whooped, top of her lungs, loud enough to be heard on the ground.</p>
<p>“Hood up,” I said, reaching up to tug the hood of her hoodie over her head.</p>
<p>“What? Why?” she asked, panting from the cheer.</p>
<p>“Just in case it’s cold,” I said.</p>
<p>“Cold? Why&mdash;”</p>
<p>Before she could fully catch her breath, I dropped from our position, diving, fast, hard, and surprising enough that even I felt my stomach’s contents lurch.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the ability to cheer, as the drop stole what little breath she had, but her arms went up and out, to either side of my shoulders, fingers spreading to feel the wind, the sun-warmed air.</p>
<p>I smiled, letting the swoop dash all of the other thoughts and feelings from my mind, vicariously enjoying the experience of flying for the first time. Of flying at all.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Juan?” I asked.</p>
<p>Juan was younger than the other kids had been. Eight, if I had to guess, but he wasn’t well, so that might have screwed up my estimation. He was thin at the arm and wrist, and puffy around the face.</p>
<p>“The first time I came to the hospital, one of the nurses wore that costume,” Juan said. “He was a guy though.”</p>
<p>“How does it look on me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I think it looks really nice,” he said. “You’re very pretty.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. “That’s sweet.”</p>
<p>“Some of the others were saying a lady superhero was going around taking people flying.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “That’s the plan. Your mom and dad said you might enjoy it, and you should be well enough.”</p>
<p>“They had to go to work,” Juan said.</p>
<p>“That’s what I heard.”</p>
<p>“They always have to go. Even when I have bad days. And there’s nothing on television. There’s only three channels and they’re real boring.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“I really hate hospitals,” he said.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. His words echoed my feelings, which only magnified the feelings.</p>
<p>Yeah. I really hated hospitals too.</p>
<p>“It’s getting dark,” I said, “But if you want to try flying, maybe that’d be a bit of a break from the boring stuff, and a break from the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Juan said. “But flying sounds like it’s very tiring.”</p>
<p>“It can be,” I said. “I can go slow if you like, or we can do something else. We could talk.”</p>
<p>He nodded at that last bit, then started looking around. I pulled up a nearby chair, and sat down next to his bed.</p>
<p>“I got a lot of books,” Juan said. He deposited a stack of kids’ books and comics on the edge of the bed, between me and him. “Uh, before. I said I didn’t want to be stuck here and be bored, my mom went and came back with books and comics, and then they both left.”</p>
<p>“That was nice of them,” I said. I picked up one of the books.</p>
<p>“My eyes are tired today,” he said. “The letters are blurry.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to read some out loud?” I asked.</p>
<p>That got me a firm nod, and the first smile I’d seen out of him.</p>
<p>“Good Simon to start, then?” I asked. Another nod.</p>
<p>There were pictures, so he shuffled over to the edge of the bed, and I sat on the other side, my ass half on the bed’s railing, and I held the book between us, so we could both see it.</p>
<p>Two good Simon books, which were most likely aimed at someone just a bit younger than Juan was, but he didn’t seem to complain. I moved on to a comic involving the robot prison ship, peeking ahead so I could skip past the scenes which were aimed at someone much older than him, and then, to be safe, moved on to something aimed at a younger age again. Kids in animal masks getting into trouble.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much likelihood that Juan had powers, but he’d had a bad day, and this was okay.</p>
<p>I was halfway through that book when I saw someone look in at the door, peeking around. A boy. He stopped as he spotted me.</p>
<p>I finished the page, then paused, partially closing the book, and checking on Juan. Fast asleep. I checked his pulse, because I was paranoid, then fixed his blankets, and eased myself up off the bed with flight, to not disturb him.</p>
<p>I used a notepad by the side of the bed, and wrote a brief farewell:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Nice to meet you, Juan. The nurses have my number so if you want to go flying sometime, we might be able to arrange something. 🙂</em><br>
<em>-Victoria</em></p>
<p>I walked over to the door. It wasn’t one of the ones I’d taken a flight with. Older, thirteen or so, with what might have been his first pimples.</p>
<p>I saw the hesitation on his face.</p>
<p>“Come on,” I said. “Let’s go to the cafeteria. It’s late, I don’t think many people will be around.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Tempera? Hi, it’s Victoria. I’m sorry to call you so late.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I don’t sleep much, and the call is more than welcome. Why the call?”</p>
<p>“I’m at the hospital, talking to someone&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You’re still at the hospital?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve been talking to a teenager, he’s listening in on my half of the conversation right now. He’s got a friend with powers, but she’s not doing so hot. It’s new and it’s scary and neither he nor she know what to do.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been there.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been there. Yeah. I know you’re in touch with the Wardens. They’re decent, they have a lot of resources, they have some good people.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“He can describe particulars and you can let them know.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem. Just so you know, it might be hard to get someone on the phone this late, but if it’s a problem, I know some people I can round up and we can go talk to her as a big supportive group.”</p>
<p>“Great. I’m going to hand you off now.”</p>
<p>“Wait, one second. Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Call me back when this is over, or call me first thing in the morning. I was sounding out some people, it’s not an invite to a team or anything, but with something this messy, we need all the hands we can get.”</p>
<p>“Messy?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain later. For now, we help your buddy there.”</p>
<p>I handed the corded phone over. We stood at an empty nurse’s station in a hallway where the lights had been set dim. My hands were free, and I’d intentionally used their phone so my own would be free.</p>
<p>There were other calls I needed to make, including one to Crystal to let her know where I was. I put that one off. Crystal was easygoing.</p>
<p>I sent one to Mrs. Yamada.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Me:<br>
</strong>I know your caseload is full, but found a kid with some power-related troubles. Contact is reaching out to Wardens soon. Maybe you can keep an eye out to make sure all goes smooth?</p>
<p>The boy was explaining in a hushed voice about his friend’s circumstance. An uncontrolled, messy power, and she had no place to go. He hadn’t given me many details, but I could tell he was scared, and I could infer from that that <em>she</em> must be terrified.</p>
<p>The reply came back.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jessica:<br>
</strong>Absolutely. I can’t promise I take them as a patient but I can help with initial moves.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>I nodded to myself.</p>
<p>The boy was relaxing as he talked on the phone. A distant, authoritative, kind voice, and the promise of some answers or help.</p>
<p>My phone buzzed again.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Jessica:<br>
</strong>A patient canceled for later this week. Do you want to meet for a late lunch? There’s something I’d like to talk to you about.</p>
<p> <strong></strong></p>
</div> <h1 id="chap21">Flare &mdash; 2.3</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>It was dark as the boy and I stepped outside. It was a flipping of perspectives, in a way, that the city lights were going out and the tent villages off in the distance were lighting up with lamps and fires. The city had only a small fraction of the light it might have had in the old world when power rationing wasn’t in effect, only a tenth the normal number of apartments were lit up. Only the major roads had light, and that meant far less people were driving, which meant less head and tail lights.</p>
<p>It was cool out, not as cold as it had been last night, thankfully.</p>
<p>It was five minutes before Tempera met us at the door. She looked a little worn out, but then again, she’d gone to the hospital, gone home, come back to the hospital, and she was juggling something with the messy situation she’d talked to me about.</p>
<p>“Hi Victoria. Hi Sam.”</p>
<p>“Hi,” Sam said.</p>
<p>“On a scale of one to ten, how serious is your friend’s situation?”</p>
<p>“Uh. Six? She’s depressed, she’s scared, she doesn’t know how to use her power, and I can’t get near her to help her. She’s afraid people are going to take her away.”</p>
<p>“How immediate is the situation? Does she need help in the next five minutes, next hour, today? Is she or anyone else in danger?”</p>
<p>“She’s alive, but I’d like to get her help soon. She’s freaking out and I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“I’m only asking like this because it’s an emergency, and since our talk on the phone it’s escalating. I’m going to take you to the Wardens headquarters, okay? I’m going that way already, I can walk you through the security and introduce you to some people, and they’ll have ideas on what to do with your friend. Sound good?”</p>
<p>“Sounds alright.”</p>
<p>“What’s the emergency?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Citizen labor is going nuts. They’re massing, pulling in some outside help, a lot of other angry and frustrated citizens. I don’t have the full picture yet, but it’s all hands on deck. Wardens are coordinating Advance Guard, Foresight, Shepherds, the Attendant and others. They’re even bringing in the PRTCJ capes, which haven’t exactly been advertised to the public.”</p>
<p>Crystal’s group. The situation was bad enough to open the can of worms that was capes serving as a military-adjunct force? In this climate, no less.</p>
<p>Tempera went on, “I and some of the other prospective Wardens are being asked to go with the Wardens proper, to handle things where they’re getting out of control offworld.”</p>
<p>“Offworld?”</p>
<p>“I recommended you, said you’d help, they’ve given a tentative a-ok on that. Things are expected to blow up when the city wakes up tomorrow, so it’s up to you if you want to help tonight or first thing tomorrow. I sent you the address?”</p>
<p>“I got it,” I said.</p>
<p>“I should go. Sam, with me.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” I said. “Sorry to pass the ball like this.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Good luck to you too, Victoria.”</p>
<p>I checked my phone, waiting painful minutes for sites to load.</p>
<p>She’d said I could help tonight or tomorrow. That things would get bad starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The news sites already had multiple headlines with the word ‘war’ followed by a question mark. And things were expected to get worse tomorrow?</p>
<p>No, I’d go tonight.</p>
<p>I’d fly, even. I messaged Crystal.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I let myself into Crystal’s apartment through the balcony, using the key Crystal had given me on the sliding glass door.</p>
<p>“I’m here,” I called out.</p>
<p>I was about to step from the living room to the hallway when a red-tinted forcefield appeared across the path, blocking my way.</p>
<p>“One moment!” Crystal called out.</p>
<p>I turned my back to the forcefield and leaned against it, my arms folded. “Can I talk to you from here?”</p>
<p>“Yep!”</p>
<p>“The headlines are saying war,” I said. “And you’re being brought in.”</p>
<p>“Could go that way,” Crystal said. “It’s wonky. Two sides are butting heads and we’ve got another world that’s pretty upset.”</p>
<p>“I’ve only heard bits and pieces from some others and the news. Is it a strike?”</p>
<p>“Not a strike. I’m dressed now, you can come through,” Crystal said. The forcefield disappeared, and I used flight to keep from falling, turning myself around before walking down the hallway and around the bend to Crystal’s room.</p>
<p>Crystal had already been in costume and with her group when she’d been ordered to get ready and be at the location within half an hour. She was using the opportunity to help get me organized. She’d showered while waiting for me, she’d donned her costume, and she was combing wet hair now.</p>
<p>Her costume was white, with her usual symbol on it, the arrow pointing down and to the side, with a stream of lines flowing from the back of the arrow, over one shoulder. She wore a jacket with it, a near-black gray, given a faint magenta-red tint. ‘PRTCJ’ was printed on the back in big white letters. A lone stylized chevron was on the sleeve.</p>
<p>There were things to be said about it, about the militaristic tilt of the group, the way the PRT and the Protectorate had broken in such a way that the Wardens had sprung up from one large chunk of the image, presentation and ideals. Crystal’s parahuman miltary thing was crudely forged from another chunk of what the PRT had been: the PRT’s old laws, rules, and discipline. A military-esque force without a government to serve or a hard and fast system of law to back it up.</p>
<p>But it was Crystal’s call. Crystal’s thing. I held my tongue.</p>
<p>“My closet,” she said. “Black trash bags. Never throwing things away pays off. It’s one of the sample batches.”</p>
<p>The bags made the clothes easy to find, even in the jam-packed closet. The contents were hidden within the trash bags, the hooks of the hangers poking up and through. Crystal indicated the bed, and I laid them out, peeling the plastic back. White costumes without icons or decoration, a variety of cuts and styles.</p>
<p>It was a familiar range. Back in the day, companies had periodically reached out to New Wave, wanting to pitch their product and get us to use them for our costuming. Mom had handled those talks and periodically singled out a family member to send a bunch of proto-costumes to. Later she would nag us for feedback that she could send the companies.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to think about mom.</p>
<p>I focused on the costumes, with some attention paid to the situation at hand. The leotard cut was a ‘never ever’. The full-body suit was problematic because of how it resembled Scion’s, and I didn’t want to go there. Those were two I could eliminate right away. I pulled the black trash bags down over them and set them aside.</p>
<p>Crystal explained, “People have been noting how fast we got back on our feet, and how we have something reasonably stable in currency and economy. We kind of got our answer.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, before guessing, “powers?”</p>
<p>“I guess powers, probably,” she said.</p>
<p>I turned to look at Crystal. She was arranging her damp hair over her eye, a curved swoop that her hairband held in place. “Only probably?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t about powers,” she said. “But I wouldn’t rule them out. They helped and they may be part of this. The key thing is that a lot of the building materials and resources we used to get started came from other worlds.”</p>
<p>“As in our people working in other worlds or&mdash;” I paused as Crystal shook her head. “Or other, alternate civilizations. Shit. You don’t get anything of that scale for free. What did we have to give them in exchange?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” Crystal said. “I don’t think many people do. There are two major groups heading the reconstruction that might have an idea but they haven’t shared. One of those groups was the one who put out the trading dollar a few months after Gold Morning, now our de-facto regular dollar. Same group that’s now looking at moving up into the greater political arena.”</p>
<p>“And those two groups are the ones butting heads?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, the two construction groups are banding together, kind of. The workers who have been doing the actual construction work seem to think they were promised a significant discount and first opportunity to buy the houses they’ve been building. They’ve been living in a tent village, working long weeks, miserable conditions.”</p>
<p>“And if they think they have dibs on the houses, the work must have been a labor of love. They’ll have a strong community too. If they didn’t kill each other working that hard in conditions that bad, they must be close.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Crystal said. “One second, be right back.”</p>
<p>I glanced over the remaining outfits. Three more options. V-neck, long-sleeved, short skirt. Not bad, but very reminiscent of ‘Glory Girl’.</p>
<p>Round neck, low enough to have a touch of cleavage, short sleeves, and shorts that cut straight across the upper thigh. If any length were taken from them at all, they wouldn’t qualify as shorts anymore. Hard to pull off. I’d need to accessorize it and I wasn’t sure I could afford the time to dig for boots, belt, or other stuff I’d need, and still get filled in.</p>
<p>The last one had a high collar, a kind of truncated turtleneck, it was sleeveless, with leggings that ended in the mid-low calf. Not bad but not great, and again, I’d need accessories.</p>
<p>Urg.</p>
<p>“The two construction groups are collaborating, banding together, the areas rezoned, contracts reworked. They say workers signed and agreed, and there are no longer ‘dibs’, as you put it.”</p>
<p>“For something that matters as much as home and shelter, with that many employees, you’d think someone would have read the contract thoroughly enough to figure that out.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>“Sounds like someone’s not being honest.”</p>
<p>“Again, Victoria, I don’t know,” Crystal said, sounding a little exasperated. “I’m&mdash; we’re, if you’re coming, <em>we’re</em> not going there or being invited there to arbitrate or negotiate. We’re not solving that particular problem. We’re there to stand between the two sides, keep the peace.”</p>
<p>I glanced at her jacket. “Just following orders.”</p>
<p>“Following orders, keeping things simple, letting others handle things,” Crystal said. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>I picked up the second costume, with the low neck, short sleeves, and short leggings, and held it up against my front.</p>
<p>“Go for it,” she said. “You definitely need to dress that up.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. “I’m going to go get changed and see if I can find footwear. If you have a minute, could you find any belts?”</p>
<p>“Utility or regular?”</p>
<p>“Either or. I like the idea of utility more, I think, for how I think I’ll be dressing up.”</p>
<p>I stepped out of Crystal’s room, pulled the curtain closed by the balcony door and quickly stripped out of my top and the skirt. I picked both up and put them with my other clothes.</p>
<p>I experienced a brief moment of displaced emotion, as if my head and body were in Crystal’s apartment, and my heart was somewhere in the past. In an exposed, open area that wasn’t mine, wasn’t comfortable, where someone could happen to step in and see me exposed at any moment.</p>
<p>The latent feeling of the hospital room. Of being in the care home.</p>
<p>Pulling the costume on helped. Deep breaths, the pull of the zipper as it closed at my back and pulled material tight against my chest and stomach. I fixed the legs, checked for bunching and wrinkles, and deemed it satisfactory. Not perfect in the way a costume made explicitly for me would be, but satisfactory.</p>
<p>I dug in boxes. I’d packed my things with shoes and boots at the bottom, clothes on top.</p>
<p>“Belts,” Crystal said. I heard the clatter as the things were tossed onto the couch. “Masks. Armband.”</p>
<p>The bag rustled as it bounced off the couch and landed on the floor. the armband landed on the couch near the belts. A black band with the Gold Morning symbol on it.</p>
<p>“Good throws,” I said. Crystal was standing with her back to me. She’d tossed them over her shoulder. “You can turn around.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said. “Don’t spend <em>too</em> much time. It’s late, it’s dark, people won’t care too much.”</p>
<p>“I won’t. Where does the other Earth and the war fit into this?” I asked. I pulled out a pair of white boots. Shoes meant for a costume might have worked better, but I tended to prefer boots for the fact that they stayed on better with hard landings, kicks, and rough falls. Fourteen year old Glory Girl had learned that lesson: it was terminally embarrassing to have a petty criminal watch as you flew over to your lost shoe and put it back on.</p>
<p>“The workers called a stop to all work. They’re holding the houses, equipment, and building materials hostage, with some suggestion they’ll destroy it all before they give up what they’re owed,” Crystal said. “The last big convoy of materials and trucks were from another Earth, and they’re part of what’s being held hostage. The delivery folk from Earth-K aren’t budging because they aren’t abandoning their delivery, even though they’ve been told they can go. The government from United States of K is getting upset because their people aren’t home, That’s where the murmurings of war are coming from. Workers aren’t conceding anything else, and construction groups aren’t either.”</p>
<p>“And our job is to make sure the stalemate stays stale and mate until people find a resolution,” I said, pulling on the boots.</p>
<p>“Or mitigate the damage if it gets ugly,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>I did up the straps, reached for the belts, all arranged around a metal ring, and found one I was satisfied with almost right away. Utility-belt style with small pouches. I tore open the bag of masks.</p>
<p>The masks were ones that were meant to be stuck to the face. Remove protective tape, stick to face like cosmetic band-aids. Not my favorite, but I got why they did it when they sent out sample packs. The glue would wear out quickly, and the real custom masks for long-term wear would then be ordered. Quality was fine, though. All in white, again, some with lenses.</p>
<p>I found one that fit around my eyes and covered my eyebrows, with white lenses, and held it up to make sure the white lenses didn’t obscure vision any. A faint halo when I looked at sources of illumination, but nothing too bad.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I think you look more like you than I’ve seen you in a long time,” she said.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m meant to wear a costume,” I said.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” she said. “But what I meant, cuz, is that from the moment you stepped into my bedroom, well before you put anything on, you looked more focused and grounded in reality than you have in a while.”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath, and glanced at the curtains. Being told I looked better reminded me that I hadn’t looked well before, which reminded me of why I hadn’t looked well, which in turn made me feel <em>less</em> better.</p>
<p>It was easier if I didn’t focus on it. “Thanks, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you were doing, I think you should do more of it.”</p>
<p>“I plan to. But for now, in the interest of time, since your formation is expecting you to hurry back, I just need to know if the mask makes me look like a dork.”</p>
<p>“It’s good,” Crystal said. She picked up one article of clothing that I’d put aside while digging for my boots. A plain white sweatshirt. “To cover up the road rash?”</p>
<p>I looked at my arms. I still had the raised red marks where I’d tumbled to the road.</p>
<p>“Or maybe not. It wouldn’t work with your forcefield,” she said.</p>
<p>It would, but I wasn’t about to explain that whole situation.</p>
<p>“No, actually, it could work,” I said. “Dress up the upper body some.”</p>
<p>She smiled, enthusiastic that I was playing along. “Exactly! I was thinking we could stick a quick heat-transfer design on this.”</p>
<p>The sweatshirt as part of my costume? It would be playing into that trend of working normal clothes into costumes. Fume Hood’s group had been big on that. A few of the villains in Lord of Loss’ group had, too, but some of that might have been them trying to fly under the radar before launching their plan.</p>
<p>The most significant trends in fashion and style were often a symptom of external factors. It was hard to get good costumes with where things were at. There was a desire, too, to appear more down to earth, to connect to the people, when sentiment was where it was at.</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. I smiled. “That could work.”</p>
<p>“Question is, do you trust me to do it?” she asked, raising one hand and producing a fan of lasers from her fingertips, shooting at a forcefield she’d created. “Or do you want to wait for the iron to get hot?”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The battle lines were drawn, so to speak. At least it was quiet here, the forces gathering in anticipation of the coming day. At the center of this particular battlefield was a single tall building, lit from bottom floor to top, even in the evening, with the power rationing being what it was.</p>
<p>The masses of construction workers had clustered in groups, the largest mass of them arranged around three sides of the building, kept on the far side of the street by the emergency services and the capes. Surrounding one of the construction company’s headquarters.</p>
<p>Lights on poles, the lighting of the news crews talking to some key individuals, and the lights the workers were carrying served to illuminate that crowd.</p>
<p>From the bird’s eye view, we could see some of the construction sites around the area, each roughly illuminated by the lights within, that light contained by the fencing that surrounded each building in progress. Construction vehicles, people, and collections of things cast long shadows with the lights set where they were. Most had lookouts posted, keeping an eye out for trouble. A couple of those lookouts turned lights our way as we flew.</p>
<p>Laserdream and I touched ground.</p>
<p>“I’ve missed flying with you,” she said.</p>
<p>I smiled. My emotions were complicated enough in the moment that I didn’t want to say anything. I didn’t trust my tone of voice or the words I might choose.</p>
<p>Easier to stick to the shallow, surface response. It was nice to be around my cousin, nice that she was happy.</p>
<p>We walked down the length of the street, the building on one side, the crowd of workers on the other. Walking helped to get my blood pumping and my body warmed up, where flying felt like it had frozen my blood and chilled me. My hands were cold, and I kept them jammed in the pockets of my sweatshirt.</p>
<p>“Laserdream. You’re cutting it close in getting back in a timely manner. Who’s this?” a cape in a jacket asked. He was a heavy guy with a very clean face, a gently curved visor covering his eyes and nose.</p>
<p>“Family,” Laserdream said. “There was a call for more help, she was invited by someone named, uh…”</p>
<p>“Tempera,” I said.</p>
<p>“Tempera. Right. We’re paying for the extra hands on deck?”</p>
<p>“We are,” the man said. “It’s not a lot.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine,” I said.</p>
<p>He looked skeptical.</p>
<p>“I can second the recommendation if it matters,” Laserdream said.</p>
<p>“It helps,” the guy said. “If she causes trouble, you know it’s your ass in the fire.”</p>
<p>“Understood, sir,” she said. “I’ve been doing patrols with her since before I could drive. I’d trust her with my life. I’m optimistic my ass will remain room temperature.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get smart. I don’t want her with the formation. If she wants in, she needs to apply and train.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t&mdash;” Laserdream said, at the same time I said, “I don’t&mdash;”</p>
<p>Laserdream ceded to me.</p>
<p>“No disrespect intended,” I said. “That isn’t for me. But I get the gist of the situation, I’ll help keep the peace, I’ll follow any orders.”</p>
<p>“You going to be alright if I send you out to help fill in the gaps at the flanks?”</p>
<p>“It’s why I’m here,” I said.</p>
<p>“South side of the building,” he said, pointing. “Stand on the dotted line, try not to stare down the crowd or antagonize them. Be gentle if they get rowdy.”</p>
<p>“Can do,” I said.</p>
<p>“Should be quiet tonight,” he said. He turned to Laserdream as he said it, but glanced at me. Including us both in the statement. “This is one of three locations. The big demonstrations are supposed to start tomorrow, at another location. Tonight they’re mainly interested in holding their ground and organizing themselves. Holding a vigil, giving cameras something to record. Would be nice if they got over it or got bored before things get started tomorrow, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>That would be why Tempera had said I could call in the morning. The workers wanted time and media attention to give their side some weight before they really took action.</p>
<p>“Get yourself in position. I’ll send someone your way with some cups of coffee in a short while.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said.</p>
<p>The parahumans along the road to the south of the building were spaced out along the painted divider in the center of the street. One parahuman every fifteen or so feet. There were no barricades, only the lights on tripods, connected to battery packs, helping to illuminate most of the road. The ambient light from nearby buildings contributed.</p>
<p>The crowd was noisy, but it was a low, constant noise. Talk, conversation, the occasional raised voice. There wasn’t a car to be seen on the street.</p>
<p>I could remember what had happened to Fume Hood. I closed my eyes for a moment, and I put my forcefield up, leaving it up. It made me uncomfortable, but a bullet would be even worse on that score.</p>
<p>The capes down the street to my left were all wearing Advance Guard icons on their sleeves and costumes. The stylized man bearing the ‘greater-than’ shaped shield, charging forward. The color of the icon changed, depending on the costume’s color scheme, but it was always such that it stood out, yellow on a red and orange costume, or purple on a blue-green one. The thick bold lines of the icon’s design tended to flow into the cape’s individual icon or the rest of the costume, the shield’s lines or the diamond-shaped frame of the icon joining the line running down the seam of the sleeve or the lines running across the chest.</p>
<p>“Who are you with?” the guy standing to my left asked. He had a face plate, with the thick bold lines and angular edges that Advance Guard tended to have, and the ‘ears’ of the plate swept back to cover his ears, giving them a pointed, elfin cast. His bodysuit was designed to accent his slim frame, a two &mdash;piece jacket and legging combo, with a very pronounced zig-zag at the waist where the upper body met the lower body. There was a slight curl at the toes.</p>
<p>“I’m independent,” I said. “For now.”</p>
<p>“We’re Advance Guard,” he said. “I’m Spright.”</p>
<p>“I’m between names,” I said. “And between costumes. Don’t judge me too harshly.”</p>
<p>“Can I see the emblem?”</p>
<p>“Just a design, not an emblem,” I said, turning my back to him to show him the rush job we’d managed with the heat-transferred image, my sweatshirt lightly singed in places. It was a circle with lines intersecting it, almost like a sun, but with the lines running into the circle. The image was offset, so the lines were shorter to the left and top of the image. Crystal’s idea and design, and I’d had no objection.</p>
<p>“Between teams, between names, between costumes?”</p>
<p>“More or less sums it up,” I said. “If you need to call me anything, you can call me Victoria.”</p>
<p>“I’m honored, Victoria,” Spright said, bowing slightly. “I’m glad for the company. We might be here for a while.”</p>
<p>“We probably will,” I said.</p>
<p>“I see you’ve got the armband. You’ve been around for at least a few years. Do you have any war stories you can share?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a good few,” I said. <em>And a lot I wouldn’t share</em>.</p>
<p>“You’re experienced, huh?”</p>
<p>“A few years under my belt. A few years of semi-retirement.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you I’m <em>very</em> experienced,” he said, with a bit of humor in his voice.</p>
<p>I looked at him, one eyebrow arched.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours,” he said.</p>
<p>“Is that how we’re doing this?”</p>
<p>“Could be,” he said. “What I’m offering is long and <em>thoroughly</em> satisfying. Are you game?”</p>
<p>“Wow,” I said. I smiled despite myself, looking over the crowd instead of at Spright. “When they said Advance Guard rushes into things, they weren’t lying.”</p>
<p>“Once you get me going, I go all night. I might as well get started early.”</p>
<p>“With an audience, though?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got nothing to hide. I’d say they could join in, but I think that would get a little hectic.”</p>
<p>“It might just,” I said. “Would be nice to steer clear of hectic for a while.”</p>
<p>“I very much agree, Victoria Between-things,” Spright said. “You have to find a good fit, strike the right rhythm, the right pace. Once you’re comfortable, you might be able to vary it up some.”</p>
<p>The woman standing to the left of Spright said something that sounded an awful lot like, “Oh my god, Spright.”</p>
<p>I checked, but it didn’t look like the people on the sidewalk heard us. The buzz of conversation seemed to drown out our voices.</p>
<p>“Is he always like this?” I asked, raising my voice a bit.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Spright said.</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “I dare say you’ve inspired him. Unfortunately.”</p>
<p>Spright sounded almost energized by his teammate’s exasperation. “I’m intrigued more than inspired. I’d love to indulge in your, ahem, stories, Victoria with the stylish icon.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that great an icon,” I said. “Nice try, though. I appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to work in the flattery somehow. There’s no shortage of things I could say, by the way, and I’m not messing around when I say that. I chose the icon because I do like it, and because when you say something nice about something like a girl’s hair or something else about their appearance, you tend to get that kneejerk resistance.”</p>
<p>“You do,” I said. <em>For me, it’s for reasons other than the usual</em>. It was a shame, but his moment of frankness had brought things home again. My tone of voice was audibly different even to myself as I said, “I’m flattered, Spright, really.”</p>
<p>“Aw darn. But?”</p>
<p>“But while I’d be happy to share a few stories, I’m not up for the other stuff you’re driving for. It’s just not where I’m at. Wouldn’t be fair to you. I’ve gotta figure myself out some, first.”</p>
<p>“I can respect that,” he said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. “I appreciate the wit. You were pretty snappy with some of that.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for letting me try, I&mdash;” Spright stopped as the woman standing to his left made a sound effect with her mouth. I didn’t hear the preceding sound, but I heard her make a sound like a small crash with her mouth. Spright switched tacks to say, “I’ll throw things at you, Tandem.”</p>
<p>The woman laughed.</p>
<p>A moment later, another person joined us. A ripple in the road, and he appeared almost instantly out of the gloom. The cape I’d met early in the day the community center had been attacked, with the blades jutting from his costume.</p>
<p>He looked at me, sizing me up.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I said.</p>
<p>“Mmh,” he made a sound, not really a response. “Hey, Spright, swap places with me for a bit.”</p>
<p>The ‘mmh’ bugged me. “I’m enjoying his company.”</p>
<p>“She’s enjoying my company, Shortcut,” Spright said. “It’s a good night.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a long night,” Shortcut said. “I think I know her from the other day.”</p>
<p>He paused, glancing back at me.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>Shortcut turned back to talk to Spright, then paused, glancing back at me. “What’s that sound?”</p>
<p>I listened, and I heard it. Scratching.</p>
<p>Without trying to look too much like I was looking down, I looked down. My forcefield, invisible to everyone present, was scratching at the road.</p>
<p>I took flight, lifting myself up enough that the arms couldn’t reach the ground. About eight feet up. From the angle, as I saw the light hit the road at a different angle, I could see the shallow gouges.</p>
<p>The good humor from earlier was spoiled a little at that.</p>
<p>“Everything okay?” Spright asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, just restless, bit of power quirkery,” I said. I realized the crowd had noticed me take flight, and the conversation had quieted a bit.</p>
<p>It was mildly surprising that, Spright’s flirting aside, nobody in a large collection of construction employees had called out to me.</p>
<p>I tested my luck, and used the opportunity to call out, “You guys doing okay!?”</p>
<p>“Bit cool out!” someone called back.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” I called back. “Better than the alternative, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>That got me a fairly mixed response.</p>
<p>“Shoulder to shoulder in the heat, stinking of sweat? You don’t want that!”</p>
<p>“We’re used to the smell of sweat, hon!” a woman called out. There were murmurs of agreement.</p>
<p>“Take care of yourselves, okay?”</p>
<p>There were a few murmured and unintelligible responses, but a more emotional cry of, “Give us our homes and we’ll be just fucking fine!” stood out. Some heads turned in that direction.</p>
<p>“It’s not up to us,” I said. “Save that energy for tomorrow, alright? We’re here to keep you safe and keep them safe.”</p>
<p>There were a few mumbled replies.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t help,” Shortcut said.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” I said. “Letting them know we’re not against them, we care about their well being? Reaching out and talking can’t hurt, can it?”</p>
<p>“I guess that’s why I’m here,” Shortcut said.</p>
<p>I looked his way.</p>
<p>“Reaching out and talking,” he said. “I just wanted to make sure there’s no hard feelings.”</p>
<p>“About you not getting into Advance Guard.”</p>
<p>I’d emailed, they’d sent a reply a couple of hours later saying no.</p>
<p>“I didn’t devote a lot of thought to it,” I said. “Sucks, but you guys have to do what you have to do. And so does everyone else, apparently. I’ll figure something out.”</p>
<p>“They didn’t tell you it was me?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. I frowned.</p>
<p>“I told them to tell you no and to tell you it was me, and why.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. “They just told me no.”</p>
<p>“Well fuck that. I thought you needed to know, what you did back there, it was shitty.”</p>
<p>“Beg pardon?”</p>
<p>“I realized after your face came up on some of the events about the Norfair community center incident. You went up against Lord of Loss?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see what the issue is,” I said.</p>
<p>“You happen to beat me to the scene, and then you use your secret identity, condescension and anti-parahuman shit to take me down a notch? And then you want a place on Advance Guard?”</p>
<p>“I happened to be there. I’m sorry, it was not my intention to come across that way.” <em>I tried to help you out some</em>.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. “Right. I can guess what your intentions were.”</p>
<p>I was pretty darn confident my handling of the situation had been alright. I was inclined to chalk this one up to the guy having a screw loose or a few bundled up issues. It still bothered me, and it bothered me more that a nice conversation had been interrupted, and now this guy was apparently intent on keeping me company for the night, telling me how I was responsible for his problems and issues.</p>
<p>I pursed my lips, doing my best to filter what he was saying, tuning out what I could and responding where necessary, so he wouldn’t add me ignoring him to his list of grievances. He was talking about the community center now.</p>
<p>Voices were raised, a few shouts, both from capes at one of the other streets, and by people in the crowd. Phones were out.</p>
<p>It was almost a welcome interruption, in that solitary moment between the initial commotion and when I realized that it meant people were hurt.</p>
<p>I rotated myself in the air, looking, trying to figure out what had happened. I saw Crystal coming, and flew to meet her.</p>
<p>“Come!” she shouted, barely pausing as she flew. I joined her, wavering as air ripped past my forcefield, lopsided in a way I couldn’t quite detect, moving.</p>
<p>I disabled the forcefield, and in the doing, I could fly straighter, but I flew against cold wind, unprotected.</p>
<p>Crystal didn’t explain. It was left for me to see.</p>
<p>Our site had been quiet. At least one of the other places workers were congregating wasn’t. People were more spread out, and I suspected from their arrangement that some had crossed the street, approaching the building. There were more emergency vehicles, more capes, and there was a large clearing in the center of the crowd.</p>
<p>Eight people were gathered toward the center of that clearing, with more scattered across the more open area. Among them, several had eyes that glowed, or glows emanating from their mouths. Shapes I couldn’t quite make out moved around them. A power at work, like the outline of something that glowed slightly in the dark, too abstract to make out.</p>
<p>I watched as two people broke from the edge of the clearing and ran toward the center group. A man and a woman, holding hands.</p>
<p>It hit me like a blow to the head. An image in my mind’s eye, a feeling, a sense of something greater. Forgotten in the same instant it occurred. I dropped out of the air, and I caught myself a moment later. Crystal did much the same.</p>
<p>“Get back!” someone hollered.</p>
<p>A megaphone blared, “Get away from the center!”</p>
<p>The eight people were sixteen now, including the two that had run toward the center and some of the people that hadn’t retreated to the clearing’s edge. Eyes glowed, powers wreathed a few hands. A spike of power-generated material was stabbing skyward in front of a woman. A man had fallen to his knees, arms spread, and the ground was rippling around them.</p>
<p>People didn’t get away from the center. Realizing what was happening, or <em>thinking</em> they knew what was happening, others dashed toward the group, joining it.</p>
<p>“Get back,” Crystal said. “If we get knocked out&mdash;”</p>
<p>I retreated, looking for where the defending capes were. Lit by flashing, noiseless sirens, the capes were clustered not far from the building. They were getting organized.</p>
<p>“It’s a broken trigger,” I said.</p>
<p>“Is it?” Crystal asked.</p>
<p>I flew straight for the heroes on scene. I didn’t get the chance to hear two words out of the leader’s mouth before we were hit again. Every one of us winced and reacted as it hit us. Too brief to be a trigger vision, incomplete, fractured, it still made itself felt.</p>
<p>The sixteen had become thirty-two.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap22">Flare &mdash; 2.4</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“Evacuate!”</p>
<p>One word from the parahuman in charge was all we needed. The clock was too short for anything more.</p>
<p>Capes fanned out, most of them on foot. I could leave the parts of the crowd closest to us to them. I flew, avoiding the sky directly over the group of affected people, circling around the periphery instead. The wind was cold against my face and legs.</p>
<p>The massed crowd of citizen workers was to my right, the people with powers to my left. Half of the light sources in and around the clearing had broken, and the only other illumination came from the effects of powers. A common thread ran through all of it. Energy spilled out and created matter where it splattered on the road, materials sprouted from nothing, streaked with thin streams of liquid that glowed like fire, and more abstract growths formed suspended in air, their images sticking to the backs of my eyes like the persistent afterimages of sparklers waved in the dark.</p>
<p>People were shouting. Some were screaming. I couldn’t make much of it out.</p>
<p>I flew to the far side of the clearing, which also happened to have some of the thickest gatherings of people. They had been citizen laborers, gathering to make their displeasure known to the construction groups. They’d been facing the building until the incident, they’d backed up, and there were places where the presence of buildings and parked vehicles made it so they had no place to retreat, leaving them now packed together, shoulder to shoulder, front to back, jostling.</p>
<p>I’d helped to evacuate before. I had attended the Leviathan attack on my hometown. I had been around for the majority of the Slaughterhouse Nine crisis. I’d participated in other, minor incidents, helping with fires and storms, though those had mostly involved helping the elderly and standing around.</p>
<p>The truism was that in a disaster, people were their own worst enemies.</p>
<p>Never this bad.</p>
<p>I’d never seen or imagined a situation where people would do the opposite of evacuating, throwing themselves headlong into the hazard. They thought the people in the center of the clearing were getting powers, and people were breaking away from the crowd at the clearing’s edge to run toward the affected individuals.</p>
<p>Crystal created a wall to block off a street as she passed it. She wouldn’t be able to keep it up as she got further away, but it bought time for others to get there.</p>
<p>She raked a laser across the road, a bright and noticeable distraction, to give people pause.</p>
<p>I dropped to the street, using a pulse of my aura to get people’s attention. Some stopped to look, while others ducked low, as if instinct drove them to shy away from the perceived threat.</p>
<p>“Run!” I shouted, using my aura to play up my words. “Other way!”</p>
<p>I saw eyes widen, and turned to look. A man had opened his mouth, and had something that looked almost as tall and thick as a telephone pole spearing skyward from his mouth. Blood streamed from the sides of his mouth, his jaw clearly dislocated, and more fluids painted the length of the pole as it continued to rise. It reached its maximum height, and then forked, the upper half splitting out into two equally thick portions, a giant ‘Y’ shape. Each branch then forked into two, and forked into two again.</p>
<p>“Go,” I said, sparing only a momentary glance for the people I’d been stopping. I saw them start to run away.</p>
<p>The man reached up, his fingers dragging along the blood-slick shaft of the trunk of the fractal tree he had vomited up. Each movement of his hands was slower and weaker than the last.</p>
<p>I flew toward him, to do what I could to help, even though I wasn’t sure what that could possibly be.</p>
<p>The ‘tree’ toppled, and it was only because I was already on my way toward him that I was able to intervene. I reached out for the falling tree, and my power was quicker to touch it. Phantom fingers bit into the surface, fracturing the chalky material. With flight, my bare hands, my power, and my aura pushed out to give people a <em>little</em> more incentive to get out of the way, I controlled the tree’s fall. It broke into chunks on contact with the ground. One of the people with new powers was pinned beneath branches, but it didn’t look like he was hurt by the contact.</p>
<p>I flew to the man who’d grown the tree. Even before I reached his side, I could see the damage that had been done. Jaw, throat, chest, and stomach had been torn away. Traces of the same material that had formed the tree had collected in his insides and pelvis, breaking into jagged pieces at some point before or during the tree’s fall.</p>
<p>He had no throat to feel for a pulse. I wasn’t about to rule anything out, even as I saw the remains of his heart in his splayed-out chest cavity. I pried one of his eyes open, and I saw no response.</p>
<p>I went from a crouch to airborne in a second.</p>
<p>That particular disaster had been dramatic and visible for a significant portion of the people nearby. Most were thinking twice about running toward the epicenter.</p>
<p>When was the next wave coming? The number of people to trigger all at once had seemed to double the last time. They didn’t look like multi-triggers either. One power each, some self-destructive. I could hear the screams and shouts of a lot of unhappy people and I couldn’t see one person who looked particularly happy about their new ability.</p>
<p>I flew to a new location, looking to see where I could get the most people away. The tree had done my work for me in one spot, Laserdream was standing at the intersection of two streets and walling them off with red-tinted, translucent fields.</p>
<p>I saw another group&mdash; people were pulling away from the crowd, which was actively trying to grab them and hold them back. Young people &mdash; older teenagers and twenty-somethings, that might have been a group of friends. Seven of them.</p>
<p>I shouted, but my voice was drowned out by the dentist-drill scream of a power somewhere nearby, by the hollers, the warnings, a dull explosion.</p>
<p>I used my aura again. Several people in the group stumbled, so caught up in reacting to my aura that they lost track of where they were going or how to put one foot in front of the other. Several others paused, helping their friends that had tripped, stopped, or fallen. The people at the edge of the crowd reacted too, pulling back away from me.</p>
<p>I’d hoped more of them would stop shouting and screaming. The affected people and the people at the edge of the clearing were making so much noise that it nearly drowned me out as I shouted, “Get back!”</p>
<p>A number of people listened. The crowd in particular was inclined to take my order, getting away from the scene. Two of the seven who’d lagged behind the others turned to go too.</p>
<p>Five, however, looked at me and then continued to run toward the scene.</p>
<p>I clenched my fist.</p>
<p>Rationally, I knew that they likely saw this as the simplest thing in the world. The people over there had powers; all they had to do to get powers was to head over there. Some might well have no idea what triggers were, or they might have bought into one of the various other theories out there, some intentionally obscuring the truth. They didn’t know better.</p>
<p>Well, the screaming should have given them pause, but that might have been balanced out by the fact that they felt especially powerless at this time in particular. Because we were only two years after the most catastrophic and traumatic loss of human life in history. Because as much as we were recovering, we were far from being where we’d been. We weren’t okay. The dispute between the citizen workers and the construction administrations only brought that home.</p>
<p>Rationally, I knew that.</p>
<p>Less rationally, I had a weak point that extended well before the Gold Morning, well before the hospital stay, well before the Slaughterhouse Nine, before the bad days against Empire Eighty-Eight, before my trigger, even. I’d spent a fair portion of my time post-trigger and especially in the hospital, thinking about it.</p>
<p>I couldn’t fucking stand being ignored.</p>
<p>I flew to intercept.</p>
<p>I hadn’t practiced with this power enough. Even using it was a hard reminder, with a mental and emotional cost. I knew I needed to come to terms with it, and my time at the hospital had been an early foray into that.</p>
<p>That had been flight, and my flight was more or less untouched.</p>
<p>I flew low, approaching a car. As with the tree, all of my powers were up and active as I reached out in the car’s direction. Phantom hands dug into the metal of the car’s body, invisible fingers stabbing through. A mass of <em>something</em> pressed down on the hood, caving it in.</p>
<p>If I had any control over those limbs, it wasn’t something that lent itself to fine touches. It didn’t work well with the careful, methodical, warrior monk approach. In this, in the instinct and the moment of frustration, I could only hope that what I wanted and what my power wanted were mostly in agreement.</p>
<p>I glanced up to make sure Laserdream wasn’t watching. I was close enough for my fingertips to brush the car’s paint as I swept my arm to one side, the holes and dents in the car twisting or opening wider as the phantom grip adjusted. The&mdash; the <em>other</em> Victoria, the phantom Victoria that had never left the hospital, the <em>wretch</em>, threw the car.</p>
<p>I canceled my power momentarily, to force it to release its hold, so it wouldn’t fling the car into the people I was trying to stop. I let it reactivate a half-second later, flying forward in the car’s direction. My defenses were up and sufficient to let me adjust the car’s trajectory with a sharp kick to the side. Just to be safe.</p>
<p>It crashed into a parked car, upside down, its roof and windows shearing into the top of the other. A loud impact, metal scraping metal, a dozen windows on the two vehicles breaking. It was raucous, chaotic, sudden and surprising, in a stark contrast to the massive, enduring weight that seemed to settle in me.</p>
<p>Harder than flying. I could tell myself I was helping people, keeping them clear of danger, and it helped much as it had with the flying, but it was still hard.</p>
<p>The fact that a car had flown into another car twenty feet in front of them was enough to stop them in their tracks. I had their full attention now.</p>
<p>“Get away! It’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>Some backed away, then ran. Two backed off but didn’t run. The last of them was a man about my age, who stepped closer to the cars, intent on climbing over them.</p>
<p>“Get away!”</p>
<p>I was prepared to grab him as he climbed onto the underside of the car I’d thrown. He continued to ignore me, finding his balance, stepping forward&mdash;</p>
<p>The fragment of a trigger vision hit me. The latest wave.</p>
<p>I saw only a flash of faces, and in seeing those faces, I saw the phantom self that clung to me. The impression lingered for only a moment before I realized the faces didn’t resemble mine.</p>
<p>The man had been springing forward from the car to the ground when the event had hit. I saw his legs swing forward, while his head remained in place. He dangled, suspended in the air.</p>
<p>I picked myself up off the ground, flying to him.</p>
<p>Gone already. No pulse, no light behind the eyes. He made a faint gurgling sound, but it was some biological process or symptom of what had happened, not a sign of life. He was pissing himself and shitting himself in death.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the air, and I caught him. It hardly mattered, he was gone, but it didn’t feel right to just let him fall. I eased him to the ground.</p>
<p>“Please help!” I heard a guy shout, amid renewed and nearby whimpers and sobs.</p>
<p>I flew. The two who had drawn back but hadn’t run&mdash; a boy and a girl. The boy was holding the girl, while she strove to stay on her tiptoes. Her face was turned skyward.</p>
<p>I flew to them, and I caught her, helping to hold her.</p>
<p>“Hold her steady!” the guy shouted.</p>
<p>I held her as steady as I could.</p>
<p>Another suspension?</p>
<p>“My neck!” the victim shrieked the words. A single glowing vein stood out on each arm, and glows on her legs suggested more of the same, but she barely seemed to care about it. Clear fluid was streaming from her nose, thinner than snot, with needle-thin streams of blood joining it.</p>
<p>“We got you,” I said. “We’re here, we’ll support you. Stay calm.”</p>
<p>“I can’t move my head!” she cried out. “Every time&mdash; my neck!”</p>
<p>“Don’t try,” I said. The guy was looking to me for help, and I wasn’t sure what to say or do.</p>
<p>“My head hurts,” she said, sounding very far away. Her words dissolved into a stream of whimpers and cries of ‘ow’.</p>
<p>I was supporting her weight, but it wasn’t easy to do it from a strength perspective with my feet on the ground, and it wasn’t easy to stay steady while flying.</p>
<p>“Laserdream!” I shouted the words, top of my lungs.</p>
<p>“Headache,” the victim said, her eyes wide. “My brain.”</p>
<p>The guy looked at me again. This time I didn’t try to hide my expression. I knew I looked grim.</p>
<p>Her brain. The Corona Pollentia, the means by which powers were operated by the parahuman. Hers had been established, but not as a fluid, functional thing. It was a nail, taking her brain and fixing it to a specific position in reality.</p>
<p>Laserdream appeared beside me.</p>
<p>“What happened?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Give her something to stand on,” I said. “She’s stuck.”</p>
<p>The forcefield appeared below. The girl no longer had to stand on her tiptoes.</p>
<p>“People are evacuating more now,” Laserdream said. “We need to handle the people toward the center. The waves are random.”</p>
<p>I turned, looking at the guy. “Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Can you run? Go tell people to get away, as fast as they can. This is bad.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to get caught in it,” Laserdream said.</p>
<p>The guy nodded.</p>
<p>“Bye Anne,” he said. He let go of the girl, transitioning the grip entirely to me, then turned to run.</p>
<p>Anne.</p>
<p>She was making small sounds, guttural. One hand came up to touch the side of my face and my hair, clumsy, as if she didn’t have full use of her fingers.</p>
<p>One pat.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Anne,” I said.</p>
<p>She made another of the gurgling sounds. She was vomiting, I realized, and with her face fixed in a skyward position, there wasn’t anything I could do. Anything I did to move her would add to the damage to her brain.</p>
<p>I hugged her, hard. After a moment, I felt her hug me back, clumsy but fierce.</p>
<p>It was only a moment later that she started to convulse, whole-body. I moved to try to seize her head and keep it from moving&mdash; a second too late. One wrenching, forced movement of her head and upper body, and the nail ripped through a good share of the material in its vicinity.</p>
<p>I caught her as she fell, and laid her out on the ground, placing her on her side.</p>
<p>“We need to help others, Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Spooky, to take to the air again. I’d seen the numbers of people affected double, roughly, and this was another doubling, to look at it. More artificial sources of light had broken, as space folded in areas, as things grew to obscure them, or as tendrils of energy lashed out like living things, distorting geography with each impact.</p>
<p>Matter creation, matter manipulation, matter distortion.</p>
<p>Over fifty people, if I had to guess. It could well have been sixty-four. They were too spread out for me to effectively ballpark. Many might well have died from their power expression or the ‘nailing down’ of the brain.</p>
<p>There was no being polite, now. One person hesitating at what could have been the edge of the affected area. I didn’t even pause as I grabbed him by the wrist, picking him up off the ground, dragging him with me, me barely six feet above the ground, him with toes and shoes scraping the road’s surface. I didn’t want the fall to be too rough if I was knocked out of the air again.</p>
<p>I half-deposited, half-threw him toward the crowd that still lingered. I pointed at the largest guy present. “You. Make sure these people get away! Keep an eye on this one!”</p>
<p>He looked spooked, and I wasn’t even using my aura. He gave me a singular nod.</p>
<p>Another two, two men together. One of them fought me as I held him, trying to pry my hand free.</p>
<p>“Assholes!” he screamed, twisting my fingers, trying to get leverage to bend one backward. “Keeping powers to yourselves!”</p>
<p>I didn’t reply. I tightened my grip to keep him from getting any one of my fingers, and I saved my breath and my focus.</p>
<p>If this was turning out as badly as it looked like it was, the aftermath would be answer enough.</p>
<p>The guy who’d fought me was deposited beside the first vehicle with flashing lights that was waiting at the edges. A fire truck.</p>
<p>“Don’t let him go back! And try to get further away, in case it expands!”</p>
<p>I was already leaving before they could answer me. I heard the shouts, though. The answers.</p>
<p>Crystal wasn’t using lasers or forcefields much anymore. Only flight, only manhandling.</p>
<p>I delivered two more armfuls of cargo, getting people clear of the danger. On my return trip, I saw the geography transforming. A culmination of everything up to this point. From matter generation, matter distortion, and matter transformation to… something that made the entire area look as though it was being smudged and smeared around, streets widening, buildings pulling back from the street.</p>
<p>Except&mdash; no. No, this was a familiar smudging and smearing. One that worked with us.</p>
<p><em>You made it</em>, <em>little V</em>, I thought. I felt emotionally numb from the series of events, the deaths I’d seen, my momentary use of my power and how the feelings I’d tapped in that moment weren’t easy to bring back into order.</p>
<p>There was only what needed to be done, the mission that stood front and center. It was difficult to execute effectively, but simple in how Glory Girl, Victoria, the phantom wretch and the capes I was working with could all agree it should be done.</p>
<p>Get people clear. Get them safe.</p>
<p>A woman screamed words that barely strung together, the heel of one hand pressed to her forehead. The other was pointed forward. She shot something that was only visible by the way light refracted at its edges. The projectile hit the ground, carrying forward like a cartoon mole and the elongated, humped trail of dirt it left in its wake. Unlike the mole, the hump was jagged, folded earth. Road folded up like complex origami. She was pinning people down, keeping them from exiting a building.</p>
<p>In the words I could make out, she wanted them to come help her, and in her actions she drove them away.</p>
<p>“Stop!” I shouted to her.</p>
<p>She shot one projectile at me. Barely visible, it cut through the air, wind shrieking.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to kill her, and if her hand at her head was any clue that she was in similar straits to Anne and the other man, a light push could do horrendous damage.</p>
<p>I drew closer to the ground, defenses up.</p>
<p><em>Work with me</em>, I told my power. My agent. My flight wobbled as I experienced the lopsided drag of a hand reaching down at one side, clawing at the ground as I passed it.</p>
<p>It didn’t create nearly enough debris.</p>
<p>I changed angles. I flew for the hump of origami road, two feet across, two feet tall, jagged and menacing.</p>
<p>I passed within a few feet of it, and let my forcefield hit it.</p>
<p>The hump of ground shattered explosively, blades of road cutting at my legs. But it did create a cloud of dust and debris.</p>
<p>She shot at me, and I reversed direction, passing the hump again, striking it.</p>
<p>The two passes created enough of a mess to block the view. I flew to the people the origami road woman had pinned down. “Go, go, go!”</p>
<p>I stood by with my defenses up, positioned to intercept any incoming projectiles. They took the chance to run for it.</p>
<p>This whole thing was a clusterfuck. How many people were caught? How many were acting irrational? What options did we have? What the hell was I supposed to do?</p>
<p>The origami woman didn’t send any attacks through the cloud of shattered road that I’d created. The moment the group was out of sight and away, I was moving again.</p>
<p>A complete and total clusterfuck. I flew high, and I looked down, wishing we had more light on the scene.</p>
<p>I could see where the distortions were being utilized. The space between the people at the edges and the center of the effect was being extended, making the clearing larger. It made it harder for people to approach, carried fleeing people away. It meant the effect had to reach further if it wanted to catch anyone.</p>
<p>In the tension and the emotions that gripped me, I felt an isolated point of peace and calm I could grab onto.</p>
<p>Vista was here, Vista had made it through Gold Morning. She was one of the people I liked. A reason I was doing what I did. She was one of the good ones, she was doing good work <em>here</em>, and I wanted to help her on multiple levels.</p>
<p>In that line of thinking, I found both the focus to think beyond mere instinct, and to realize what I could do. I knew how Vista worked.</p>
<p>“It’s Vista,” Laserdream said. She’d appeared beside me again. She had a flying cape with her.</p>
<p>“Come on,” I said. I flew for where the expansion of space seemed weakest, even pinched.</p>
<p>They weren’t on the streets. It was people in buildings.</p>
<p>I tore through a door, flew through a house. Nothing. I bumped into Laserdream and her PRTCJ friend on the way out. “Search the buildings. Vista’s power is weakest when it has people in its area. There are people near here.”</p>
<p>We spread out. One building each, searching neighboring houses. I was midway through my search when I heard a whistle.</p>
<p>I flew to the sound. Vagrants, or just refugees from Gimel who had decided they’d be more comfortable squatting in unoccupied, recently built houses than they were in the tent cities.</p>
<p>The three of us carried them clear. We were delivering them to safety when the next pulse hit. We weren’t hit, but I could see a glowing figure in the sky flicker and drop briefly before they caught themselves.</p>
<p>We took to the sky again, looking for pinched areas where things hadn’t distorted enough. There were two spots, and both were already being addressed.</p>
<p>The area was clear. We found our way to where the Warden-affiliated capes had collected. They had gathered at the edge of the effect.</p>
<p>“I think we’re clear, Rocketround, sir,” Laserdream reported.</p>
<p>“We should be shortly,” the leader said, glancing at a Foresight cape who stood nearby.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” the cape said. A girl with a hood and blindfold.</p>
<p>“How many?” Rocketround asked.</p>
<p>“Ninety two, if you include the ones in houses,” she said.</p>
<p>Rocketround paused, staring down the length of the road toward the center of the vastly extended clearing. He spat. When he spoke, he managed a tone that pretty perfectly encapsulated what I and probably most of us were feeling, “Fuck me.”</p>
<p>Ninety two. Ninety two, many like Anne. Many wanting help. I wanted to fly in, to do something.</p>
<p>“I want everyone clear of the area. We wait, we see what happens,” he said. “We see if it expands in reach with further pulses, but I don’t want to give it anything. Not even any bounceback from reaching out and finding some of us. Let me know when the next pulse happens.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” the blindfolded girl said.</p>
<p>Something in the distance crashed to ground. Another fixture like the fractal tree?</p>
<p>Laserdream approached me, and she put an arm around me. I did the same for her.</p>
<p>There was small talk, people remarking on what they’d seen. Horrible things. People buried alive by their own powers. A few cases like what I’d observed.</p>
<p>“Is Vista around?” I asked. “That was her, right?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t expected Rocketround to be the one to answer, but he was the one who spoke up, saying, “She is. Upstairs, top floor. She said she needed a view and no interruptions.”</p>
<p>No interruptions. I was disappointed.</p>
<p>“Who’s she with?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Wardens,” he said.</p>
<p>“Good for her,” I said.</p>
<p>“Who are you and who are you with?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Victoria Dallon. Nobody, yet. I’ve been interviewing for teams.”</p>
<p>“She did pretty good work,” blindfold girl said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>“When you three got the homeless out of the house, Vista said something under her breath. I think it was ‘thank you’. They were getting in her way somehow.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I’m from her town. I was briefly her teammate.”</p>
<p>It was so mundane it was chilling and disconcerting, after the chaos we’d just weathered. A few moments of horrible, of stupidity and damage and madness, and now we waited to see what happened next, waiting to see what the aftermath would be. We talked about dumb things.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Rocketround asked. “Not just asking you, Victoria. Anyone.”</p>
<p>It was in that question that I saw the first real hint that he was shaken. He was doubting his own capacity in this.</p>
<p>“This is going to hurt,” another cape said. “People were already feeling pretty beaten down, and… ninety people? We lost ninety?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know if all of them are in trouble,” Laserdream said.</p>
<p>“I think they might be,” blindfold girl said.</p>
<p>Laserdream didn’t have a response for that. She only hugged me tighter with the one arm.</p>
<p>“I think&mdash;” I started. “Just speculation.”</p>
<p>“<em>Any</em> clues or guesses about what’s going on would be good,” Rocketround said. He was gripping his upper arm as he stood with arms folded. He’d emphasized ‘any’, which only served to emphasize how little a clue he and we had.</p>
<p>“The broken triggers are pretty out there. Not a lot of consistent points or facts… except that they’re big,” I said.</p>
<p>“Big?” a nearby cape asked.</p>
<p>“They tend to cover a lot of ground. Shaker stuff.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rocketround said. “That’s come up in briefings.”</p>
<p>“Location, environment, and position matters a lot,” I said. “The capes closest to the perimeter were least mobile. I think the further they got from the center, the less flex there was. Until their agents wouldn’t let them move at all.”</p>
<p>“Typhlosis pointed that out,” Rocketround said, indicating the girl with the blindfold.</p>
<p>“We might want to make them stay put,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rocketround said. “We’ll do that.”</p>
<p>Someone else spoke up. A remark about common thread through the powers they’d seen. Others chimed in.</p>
<p>I only half-listened. A lot of images stayed with me. The faces I’d seen midway through the one fragmented trigger, the indents in the car as the phantom limbs had reached out for it, Anne. The lingering sensation of Anne clinging to me, hard, the touch on my face. I didn’t know what she had wanted to communicate. A last kind gesture?</p>
<p>“There we go,” the blindfolded girl said. “Pulse. Nobody else affected.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to approach,” Rocketround said. “Roadblock? I’d appreciate it if you came.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” a cape by the side said. A guy in heavy armor.</p>
<p>“Protect me if we run into any trouble.”</p>
<p>“Only four left,” Typhlosis said.</p>
<p>“Four?” Rocketround sounded surprised.</p>
<p>Laserdream’s head snapped around. Looking at me, looking at Typhlosis.</p>
<p>Typhlosis continued, “Only four alive, still. The rest went down. Eaten by their powers, or they tried to move when they couldn’t, and their brains caved in.”</p>
<p>I squeezed Laserdream’s hand.</p>
<p>I might have been less surprised than her because I’d read up more on how these things tended to go.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Rocketround said. “Anyone comfortable joining me, come.”</p>
<p>They speed-marched toward the center of the effect. One hand on another cape’s arm for support and guidance, Typhlosis directed us toward the nearest surviving cape.</p>
<p>“Three,” she said, as we got close enough to see him.</p>
<p>He was a man, mid-twenties. His legs and stomach were buried in a writhing mass of something very similar to the origami road I’d seen earlier, materials made thin, folded many times over, until they didn’t quite seem to be three dimensions anymore. Some of those materials were the pieces of the twenty or so people in his immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>A lone figure, standing on a hill of the fallen citizen workers, caught up in the broken trigger’s effect.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” Rocketround shouted. “Alright!?”</p>
<p>“Not moving,” was the response, quiet.</p>
<p>“No using powers. Stay put, stay calm. We’re going to find out a way to help you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can be helped,” the man said. His head was bowed, and he couldn’t seem to move it. His hair was long, tied back into a low ponytail, and it covered much of his face.</p>
<p>“We can figure something out,” Rocketround said.</p>
<p>“Two,” Typhlosis said, quiet.</p>
<p>Two parahumans left.</p>
<p>The effect had caught over ninety over what couldn’t have been more than fifteen minutes. Now there were two.</p>
<p>“I’m worried,” the man in the clearing’s center said. “I can feel all the others.”</p>
<p>He moved his hand.</p>
<p>Every body in the vicinity moved. A matching movement of hands, limp arms rolling off of sides or fingers digging into powdered sidewalk.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!” Rocketround called out.</p>
<p>“I’m on a brink, and I can’t see it, but I can feel it,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Try not to think about it,” Rocketround said. “Okay?”</p>
<p>“I can feel it,” the man said. He wasn’t paying much attention to Rocketround. “All the way down to this vast well, partially filled with potential energy. Like I’m on the lip of a volcano and it’s an impossibly long fall with only magma at the bottom. I don’t know if I’m better off throwing myself down into that or leaving it alone.”</p>
<p>“Leave it alone,” I said, my voice joining more than one other person’s.</p>
<p>“What if my thoughts and brain get made into a part of that? One piece in that thing’s construction. What if it makes me immortal, forever a part of this thing? A recording of me in there, how I think, how I do things.”</p>
<p>“We’ve studied parahumans, powers and power sources a lot,” Roadblock said. “We’re pretty sure that’s not a thing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the guy in the clearing’s center said. “But…”</p>
<p>He trailed off.</p>
<p>“It’s not a thing,” Rocketround’s voice joined Roadblock’s.</p>
<p>“But I’m standing closer to it than you are,” the man said. “And from where I stand, I feel like it might be.”</p>
<p>Nobody had a ready response to that.</p>
<p>“One,” Typhlosis murmured.</p>
<p>“I’m the last one standing on the brink now,” the man said. “I don’t think I can do this much longer. Do I embrace it or turn away? I wish I could see you, to&mdash;”</p>
<p>He reached up, to move his hair out of his eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” I called out. My voice wasn’t the only voice of protest, but it might have been the first. Perhaps because I was most mindful of arms that weren’t mine, in my immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>The arms of people all around him operated as extensions of him. A matching, reaching movement, up and out. Some disintegrated as they moved, but one lying next to him reached up, out, and into the finely spun construction of road that cocooned the man’s legs.</p>
<p>As I’d done to the altered road, the reaching arm broke the construction like it was sugar crystal or a snow globe. There was a spray of blood, and the man dropped, jerking as his Corona Pollentia remained in place, briefly suspending him. He was dead in that instant, well before he sprawled to the ground, shattered from the waist down.</p>
<p>My hand held Laserdream’s tight.</p>
<p>I was thankful that Typhlosis didn’t give us an updated count.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Crystal had backed me up for a good while. She’d been a friend, a support.</p>
<p>She had performed during the event. She’d been focused, she’d done what she needed to do. It had been after that she faltered. Hearing that the people who’d been touched by the broken trigger weren’t doing well, then hearing that only four remained. Hearing and seeing those four drop away.</p>
<p>It had been that way for Leviathan, too.</p>
<p>It had probably been that way after I went to the hospital.</p>
<p>Fine during, not so fine after.</p>
<p>It had been ten days, now. Ten days after the broken trigger with the citizen workers. One of the worst we’d seen for citizen casualties and damage.</p>
<p>I landed on the balcony, letting myself in. I took the carton out of the plastic bag and popped it into the microwave, lid ajar. Eighteen seconds.</p>
<p>“Vic?” Crystal called out.</p>
<p>“I’m here. One second.”</p>
<p>“That had better not be what I think it is.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Crystal groaned audibly.</p>
<p>I pulled the carton free, grabbed some spoons, and walked over to the living room. Crystal was sitting in the armchair, watching TV, a blanket on her lap.</p>
<p>She glared at me, but it was a mock glare, and it softened considerably as she saw the carton.</p>
<p>“Slightly melted brownie caramel ice cream,” I said. I collapsed onto the couch, reaching high overhead to hold the carton and a spoon out to her. “I’ll share it with you.”</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re sharing it…”</p>
<p>“I’ll exercise with you too, to work it off. For now, though, it’s comfort food, staying cozy, and keeping each other company.”</p>
<p>“Okay. You’re mostly forgiven.”</p>
<p>“And a stupid-in-a-good-way movie to watch,” I said, pulling the movie case out of the pocket I’d wedged it into. “Because it turns out TV sucks after the world ends, and I can’t watch you subject yourself to it.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said. “You’re forgiven.”</p>
<p>I popped the movie in, then settled on the couch, pulling a blanket over my legs, arranging a cushion to sit up against. I fetched my phone and checked my messages. A second cancellation from Jessica.</p>
<p>After a disaster like that, too many people needed looking after.</p>
<p>I twisted my head around to look at Crystal, as she ate a spoonful of icecream from the carton. She passed it to me and I took a bite for myself, from the side she hadn’t dug into. I passed it back, watching as the movie started.</p>
<p>My turn to look after Crystal.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The lights were off in the coffee shop, though it wasn’t dark with the light coming in through the windows. The majority of the customers were sitting on the outside patio, and the interior was quiet, empty, and cool.</p>
<p>It was eerie, to go from the disaster to the more or less quiet period after. To be back on this street, where the car had hit the pillar, and where I’d seen so much grief from one person, and to try and reconcile that with the broken trigger, the ninety dead, the fact that so many were dealing by ignoring it. Moving on a matter of two weeks after the fact.</p>
<p>“Victoria?” the barista asked me.</p>
<p>My first thought was that she’d recognized me. “Yes?”</p>
<p>“Your friend stepped into the back. She said she’d be right out, but she asked us to keep an eye out for you so you didn’t think she was late.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Can I get you anything?”</p>
<p>I looked outside. Sunny, warm. The summer and its heat lingered in the daytime. “I can’t bring myself to drink anything hot when the weather’s like this. Do you have any suggestions?”</p>
<p>“Ice coffee? Iced tea? Pop?”</p>
<p>“Iced tea, please,” I said, noting the use of ‘pop’. A lot of people from a lot of regions had gathered in the megalopolis.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to sit down and wait for her to bring it to me. It was in my hands within a matter of seconds, and I took it to the seat furthest from the door, where Jessica and I would have some privacy.</p>
<p>She was out of the washroom before I’d fully settled in. Her blouse had buttons at the front and a collar, but was sleeveless, tucked into shorts. I wondered if she looked less at ease in casual clothing because she was a professional at heart, or if it was personal bias and years of knowing her as the therapist in the office that colored my perceptions. Her hair was damp, and she had what might’ve been a folded paper towel, soaked with water, resting on the back of her neck. She collected a drink she must have ordered and paid for earlier.</p>
<p>“Doing alright?” I asked.</p>
<p>Jessica smiled. “I was cooling down. I’ll be glad when the weather is more comfortably cool.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s not that I mind the heat. It’s that I worry about how it affects people. I get antsy when the weather is like this.”</p>
<p>Jessica nodded. She glanced out the window. “It doesn’t help.”</p>
<p>“Brockton Bay was always nice, weather-wise. It didn’t have a lot going for it, but it did have mild weather. Once upon a time.”</p>
<p>Jessica smiled. “It’s good to remember the good things. At the risk of slipping into habit, I’ll ask: how are you doing? You’re okay, after the broken trigger incident?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay. My cousin wasn’t, but she’s bounced back. I think it was a wake-up call.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“She might be reconsidering if she wants to be with the PRTCJ. She might aim for something lower-key. Her mom did, after things went bad in Brockton Bay.”</p>
<p>“I hope she’s happy and comfortable, wherever she ends up. I did like her, when she and I crossed paths.”</p>
<p><em>At the hospital</em>. That fragment went unspoken.</p>
<p>“How’s the girl I found?” I asked.</p>
<p>“She’s managing. We’re getting her stabilized and figuring out her power. She wants to meet you at some point, to thank you.”</p>
<p>“She’s good, though?”</p>
<p>“Far better than she was.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“The broken trigger aside, how have you managed since we last talked? You talked about joining a team.”</p>
<p>I gave her a one-shoulder shrug. “Pitched myself to a few. It didn’t take. I lost my job, the volunteer stuff feels empty. I’ll survive in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“I find it very interesting that you asked about Hunter, and you wanted to clarify that she wasn’t just managing, she was good. Then I ask you, and your response is that you’re surviving. You’re managing.”</p>
<p>“You’re going therapist mode on me,” I remarked, smiling.</p>
<p>She smiled back.</p>
<p>“How are you?” I asked, before she could ask me the same.</p>
<p>“I’m settling into my new role, trying to wrap things up and make sure there are no loose ends as I transition. Are you&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You said&mdash;” I said, inadvertently interrupting her.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“You said you were busy. Is busy a good thing, in Jessica-Yamada-land?”</p>
<p>It took her a second to answer. Not our usual one-sided dialogue, this, her talking, me waiting for a chance to communicate, already plotting how I could say what I wanted to say as efficiently as possible. I smiled at the observation, and I was left pretty sure she caught it, because she smiled again.</p>
<p>She replied, “I’m looking forward to when I have more time. Right now, it’s balancing out. Any exhaustion on my part is easier to deal with because the things I’m doing are new, exciting, a little terrifying, but positive overall.”</p>
<p>“Terrifying? Because of the people you’re dealing with, or…?”</p>
<p>“When working with patients, the first and last meetings are the hardest, with the stakes greatest, and I’m having an awful lot of first and last meetings these days. Maintaining course after the initial connections have been made is easier. I know who I’m talking to and what I’m doing, there will be peaks, plateaus and valleys, but I can generally feel like there’s progress being made. The first meetings and the goodbyes? They’re critically important.”</p>
<p>“You want to make sure you’re laying good groundwork.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just that. The wrong kind of connection or break can do a lot of damage. Failing to realize you’re hurting a patient when you say something or take an approach, failing to be strong enough from the outset with patients who need a hard line, being too hard on patients who need a soft touch…”</p>
<p>I nodded. I started to think about which I’d been, back then, but thinking back was hard and unpleasant.</p>
<p>“I…” She’d started to say something, and then stopped.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>She sighed, leaning back in her seat.</p>
<p>“I’ve put myself in an awkward position here,” she said. “Actually a few, including you and me sitting here having this conversation. I want to get right to it so you’re not talking to me under the wrong pretenses, but I’m not sure how to navigate this, either.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</p>
<p>“That’s just it,” she said. She frowned. “I wanted to have a conversation with you for another reason.”</p>
<p>That stung, in a way. That we weren’t meeting up for the sake of meeting up.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“I might have made a mistake,” she said. “And I was thinking you might be able to help.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap23">Flare &mdash; 2.5</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“A mistake?”</p>
<p>“I worry it’s the case. Time will tell, but I can make educated guesses and I have concerns.”</p>
<p>“I have to admit, I’m not sure how to respond to that,” I said. “I’d say you’re only human or you’re only mortal, but doesn’t that sound condescending, coming from a parahuman?”</p>
<p>“We’re all mortal, Victoria. Even Scion was.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>It was strange to hear that name spoken out loud. Nine out of ten times, people would avoid saying it out loud. As if they couldn’t reconcile the first hero with the thing that had ended the world.</p>
<p>“I’d like to help,” I said. “A couple of things are off the table, obviously, but you know what they are, I think. I wouldn’t be okay if you wanted me to reach out to my sister, or that kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t ask you to do that, no. This isn’t anything of that scale, but…” she frowned. “Given our relationship, with you having been my patient, there’s a power imbalance. I want to do what I can to ensure I don’t abuse it. I want to be fair to you.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. After a pause, I added, “I appreciate the sentiment.”</p>
<p>“Even if this turns out to be minor, it is hard to do without risking a breach of trust and damage to our friendship.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“I want to ensure we’re on the same page, when it comes to expectations. I definitely don’t want you to feel obligated, whether it’s because you feel you owe me something, or because you feel you should. I know there’s a tendency among heroes to want to step forward and help. I’ve counseled many a junior hero that they needed to learn to pick their battles.”</p>
<p>“I have no idea what you mean,” I said. “I pick my battles. Except for the broken trigger last week, the community center, and, oh, everything else.”</p>
<p>“It is a concern,” she said. She matched my smile with a small one of her own, but it was fleeting, more an acknowledgement of the joke than anything. “You’re quick to say you want to help, before you even know what I’m going to ask.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I don’t think you’d ask if you hadn’t thought over it. I trust you.”</p>
<p>“I’d still be concerned, grateful as I am for your trust in me.”</p>
<p>I swished the ice in my iced tea.</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” she said.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“If I’ve upset you, approaching this like I have.”</p>
<p>“Did I give you that impression? That I was upset?” I was pretty sure my face hadn’t betrayed anything. I was reasonably sure my power wasn’t leaking, either.</p>
<p>“You did. And if I’m right about that, please don’t misunderstand me, I am sorry, and I wouldn’t fault you for being upset. I would like to have meetings like the one I think you were anticipating today. You and me, staying in touch to a degree, talking over iced tea and ice coffee. I’d hoped to have one of those meetings before getting around to this topic.”</p>
<p>So it wasn’t too urgent, then.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. I took another careful sip of my iced tea.</p>
<p>She drew in a deep breath, reached back to where the damp, folded paper towel was laying against her neck, and set it within the lid of her iced coffee, which she’d put to one side. She stared down at it for a moment.</p>
<p>I waited. I had some ideas about what she was getting around to. I also had things I might have said, but I was worried that, depending on what she was going to say next, they could be things I’d regret. If her reasons were good, if they were personal…</p>
<p>I was so fucking done with regrets. I didn’t want to add more, especially any tied to Jessica.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to compound my mistakes elsewhere with one here. With that in mind, I want to make it absolutely clear that this isn’t an obligation. I’d like a bit of help, if you heard me out and were comfortable giving it. I’d explain the situation as best as I could, but the confidentiality of other patients makes things difficult.”</p>
<p>“What do you need?”</p>
<p>“Before we get into that, touching back on what I said before about wanting to be fair to you, I’ve contacted a colleague. He’ll be your therapist if you still want one. He’s waiting for your call and he’ll make an appointment with you.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to do that. I wouldn’t want to burden you guys more. What’s going on, that you’re going to all this?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s necessary, maybe not, but it’s my apology and my thanks to you for having this conversation with me, and for any compromise of the relationship. It doesn’t mean you have to hear me out, and it absolutely doesn’t mean you have to say yes. Alright?”</p>
<p>“Alright, but it doesn’t matter,” I said. “I’ll hear you out.”</p>
<p>“It matters to me,” she said, firm.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said, a little exasperated. It was clear Jessica was stubborn when she was bothered by something. “Fine. You made a mistake, you want my help. I’ll phone your colleague and possibly go see him. I’ll weigh what you’re asking and I’ll try to make an objective decision. Which may be no.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“What do you need?” I asked, again, holding my iced tea in both hands.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada wasn’t ‘Jessica’ anymore, not any more than capes went by their civilian names in costume. She was in her professional attire, a suit jacket over a blouse, a business skirt, minimal jewelry, minimal and tasteful makeup. Papers rustled as she paged through files and as the wind blew into the room.</p>
<p>She had told me to dress in a way that was comfortable for me. It was still hot out and I’d had to travel forty miles to get to a place where Mrs. Yamada could pick me up to drive me the rest of the way. Even though the heat persisted, the weather had broken, the humidity giving way to a light thunderstorm. I wore a white dress with a black hood built into it, the Brockton Bay skyline printed in what looked like black and grey watercolors across the breast, the city’s name below and to the side. There was a scribbling of more watercolor and lettering at the hem. The white fabric was a thin sweatshirt-like material, so the hood hadn’t been much use against the rain.</p>
<p>The windows were open and the blinds closed, periodically clacking against the windowsills. The wind wasn’t blowing in a direction that sent the rain into the room, but droplets still beaded the blinds closer to the bottom. The lights felt artificially bright, in contrast to how dark the clouds and sky were outside. The room was set up like a high school classroom, minus the ‘class’, no students, no mess, no bulletin board with scraps on it or whiteboard with weeks-old marks that hadn’t been wiped away. Eight chairs were arranged in a ring at the center, instead of five columns of six desks.</p>
<p>There was a teacher’s desk at the front, and Mrs. Yamada was there, looking over some files. I’d caught some glimpses of the pictures on the fronts, purely by accident. I could have pried more, maybe caught a name or a heading by reading upside-down, and I’d decided not to. She wouldn’t have wanted me to.</p>
<p>“Do I have a file?” I asked. She startled a little, as if she’d forgotten I was there.</p>
<p>She’d been in the zone, I realized. She might have needed to be. She didn’t wear it on her face or in her body language, but there was a reason she was so immersed in what she was reading.</p>
<p>I could relate to that, in a way. During my hospital stay, I’d delved deep into my studies, struggled with the keyboard as I read everything I could find, while furthering my studies with long-distance education.</p>
<p>“Sorry to interrupt,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You did have a file. You don’t now, I’m afraid. Unless it’s somewhere in the rubble.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She glanced at the clock. “One of the group’s members tends to arrive early. She should be here momentarily.”</p>
<p>I looked up at the clock. One fifty in the afternoon. From how dark it was outside, I might have thought it was five hours later in the day. “Good to know.”</p>
<p>“It will be interesting to see how you two get on.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>I heard the footsteps and glanced at the clock again. Not even a minute had elapsed. Was this person that punctual?</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what I’d expected. She wasn’t yet a teenager, or if she was then she was a late bloomer, but she wasn’t wholly a ‘child’ either. ‘Tween’. My first thought was that she was as cute as a button, and not in the pink princess way.</p>
<p>She was black, her arms and legs long and skinny, her eyes large in proportion to her face. She was studying me with just as much or more intensity than I studied her, as we sized each other up.</p>
<p>She was dressed or had been dressed with an eye for modern fashion, fitting to her age. She wore a blue corduroy pinafore dress with metal studs forming a star shape at the leg. Her top was a t-shirt, with an image on it in sequins, the kind that had two different images, depending on the direction the sequins were swept. The image depicted a blue heart if brushed one way, a yellow star if swept the other; I knew because it was a jumbled mix of both.</p>
<p>The reason I thought that she might have been dressed by someone else was that she was so very precise about how she’d put her outfit together. It was freshly ironed or fresh off the rack, and it was color matched from her shoes to the pins and ties in her hair. The star theme too. Kinky black hair had been fixed into place at the side of her head with a star pin, and carefully arranged into two small, tight buns at the back. Glossy and taken care of, not a strand out of place. It would have taken me twenty or thirty minutes to do the same, and my straight hair would have been easier to manage, even being as long as it was.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I responded.</p>
<p>“Gosh, you’re pretty,” she said.</p>
<p>I was momentarily lost for words. Very direct.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, glancing back at Mrs. Yamada, hoping for a cue. She was focusing on her notes. She briefly met my eye, but communicated nothing.</p>
<p>“I can tell you were a hero. You have that air about you,” the girl said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, a little caught off guard. “It’s nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>She smiled, her enthusiasm renewed, “It’s <i>amazing</i> to meet you. I’m really interested to hear what you have to say. I really want to be a hero, so I’m trying to learn all I can.”</p>
<p>“That could be good. It’s better than the alternative, at least.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? You were probably a good one, weren’t you? You give me that impression. You’re stylish, I really like your dress, and you have that posture, back straight, unyielding. Only the best and the true up-and-comers have that.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“There’s no pressure.”</p>
<p>Kenzie only smiled in response.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said. I was glad to have a window to speak. “I like your outfit too, Kenzie. Good clothes are so hard to get these days, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>“This outfit was part of a birthday present, but I think it was expensive, yeah. I wanted to look nicer since we had someone new today.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to go to extra trouble. Not for me.”</p>
<p>“No trouble, no trouble,” she said, very cavalier. She looked at Mrs. Yamada, “How are you today, Mrs. Yamada?”</p>
<p>“I’m doing very well today, Kenzie. How are you this morning?”</p>
<p>“Can’t complain,” Kenzie said. “Does it matter where I sit?”</p>
<p>“Nothing’s changed from the prior sessions. Sit wherever you’re comfortable, it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Kenzie smiled. “I think it matters. It means something. Can I sit here?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>She seated herself in the chair next to the one I was standing beside.</p>
<p>I snuck a glance at Mrs. Yamada, and I saw <i>concern</i>. Because of the others who were due to arrive?</p>
<p>“You probably caught my name, I’m Kenzie.”</p>
<p>She was extending a hand for me to shake. I shook it, then turned the chair a bit as I sat down. “Victoria. Some call me Vicky, but I’m using that less these days. You can use it if it’s easier.”</p>
<p>“And you’re a heroine?”</p>
<p>“I used to be. I’m on hiatus.”</p>
<p>“That’s the coolest thing,” Kenzie said. “Costumes, fighting bad guys.”</p>
<p>“It had its ups and downs,” I said. I glanced at Mrs. Yamada. Her focus was on her notes.</p>
<p>She noticed me looking and asked, “You used to be her patient?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“She’s the <i>best</i>,” Kenzie said, leaning over and speaking with a voice quiet enough that Mrs. Yamada wouldn’t necessarily hear.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. Except for her apparent mistake here, which I wasn’t equipped to make a judgment call on. Not quite yet.</p>
<p>“It’s good here; I always look forward to coming. Everyone’s pretty neat. That might not mean a lot coming from me, though.”</p>
<p>“How come?”</p>
<p>“I think <i>everyone’s</i> pretty neat,” she said.</p>
<p>“I see. That’s admirable.”</p>
<p>The papers rustled. Mrs. Yamada put the files in a filing cabinet beside the desk at the end of the room, locking them away. She spoke aloud, “Can I get you two anything? Water?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, but thank you,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“No thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>“The others may be a bit late, with the weather being what it is.”</p>
<p>“I think we’ll survive the wait,” Kenzie said. “Right, Victoria?”</p>
<p>“We’ll survive. Past years have taught me patience, if nothing else,” I said.</p>
<p>“From being a Ward? Were you a Ward?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p><i>That wasn’t where or why</i>, I thought, but I said, “Very briefly. My family had a team. Still does, kind of.”</p>
<p>Very kind of.</p>
<p>“Oh, wow, neat.”</p>
<p>I tried to find a diplomatic way to respond to that.</p>
<p>“Or not so neat?” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Ups and downs,” I said.</p>
<p>“I was with the PRT, but I wasn’t a Ward exactly,” she said. “They had trouble sticking me anywhere, and then I went into training, and got to do a lot of really neat camps and exercises and travel, because they had to wait until I was old enough before they could put me where they <i>really</i> wanted to put me.”</p>
<p>“Which was?”</p>
<p>“Watchdog, grrr,” she said. She’d made a pretty sad attempt at a growl, mischief in her eyes. “That other branch that worked under the PRT that you almost never hear about. Oversight and investigation, powers, money, and politics.”</p>
<p>“I know of Watchdog.”</p>
<p>“Cubicle superheroes.”</p>
<p>“They’re actually pretty badass from what I heard, and they do&mdash; <i>did</i> a lot of fieldwork and investigations, raiding offices, interrogations, talking to politicians, uncovering conspiracies.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“There’s something about getting organized and going after that thinker or that tinker who’s been working behind the scenes, the guy that’s been subverting society for their own gain, when they’ve probably spent months or years making contingency plans and anticipating the day their world and their plans come crashing down around them. I think that dynamic is pretty damn cool, the approach and the complexity of it.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, that is cool,” she said. “Except there aren’t any awesome costumes or monster fighting.”</p>
<p>“Less monster fighting, I’m sure. I’m not sure about the costumes. There are probably masks, I guess?”</p>
<p>“And there’s <i>some</i> cublical&mdash; bleh. <i>Cubicle</i> jockeying.”</p>
<p>She spoke so fast she had tripped over the word.</p>
<p>I replied, “Probably a lot, yeah. But from my short stint in the Wards, there was a lot of paperwork there too.”</p>
<p>“That’s so true. I was <i>kind</i> <i>of</i> a Ward, so I had to do some. I think I was good at the paperwork.”</p>
<p>I was starting to feel like she’d been the one who had fussed with her appearance, rather than any parental figure. Someone so fussy would’ve somehow been mentioned in the life story to this point. It was very believable, too, to draw a connection between the fastidious appearance and her pride in the paperwork.</p>
<p>“I think I was too.”</p>
<p>She nodded, the conversation momentarily, almost mercifully pausing, then she found her place, enthusiasm returning. “So yeah. I was bouncing all over the place. The Youth Guard stepped in, I’m not sure if you’ve had to deal with them.”</p>
<p>The Youth Guard or the Y.G. were the group that acted like the union that protected minors in Hollywood. That <i>had</i> protected minors in Hollywood. They were the group that made sure that Wards’ education and options didn’t suffer as a consequence for them being superheroes, that they didn’t dress provocatively, that they were safe and sane, that nobody took advantage, and other stuff. They’d reached out to my parents at one point, because they weren’t limited to the PRT. They were a guillotine that had hung over the heads of any team with under-eighteen heroes or heroines.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the horror stories,” I said.</p>
<p>“They weren’t a horror story for me. They said I was being moved around too much and I needed to go somewhere to stay. Not going to the fun camps and training sucked, but I went back to Baltimore, and I got to set up my workshop, <i>fi-nuh-ly</i>.”</p>
<p>“Workshop, huh?”</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada spoke up. She still sat at the desk. “You might want to be mindful of what you reveal. I’ll get into that more when things get started, but take a moment and think before revealing things that might tie into your cape identity, or identifying parts of your background.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mrs. Yamada,” Kenzie said. Then she leaned close to me, whispering, “I took a moment to think and I think I’m safe telling you I’m a tinker.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha,” I said, mimicking her volume and whisper.</p>
<p>“Yep,” she said. She pitched her voice lower, “The Youth Guard was good to me. I liked the people who I worked with there, even if the people in charge of me didn’t. Some of my favorite people next to Mrs. Yamada worked for them. Not that that lasted for long. That was only the spring of twenty-thirteen&mdash;”</p>
<p>As she talked, I glanced at Mrs. Yamada. It was clear she heard.</p>
<p>“&mdash;and then, well…”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>Gold Morning.</p>
<p>I was a little caught off guard by Kenzie, on a few fronts. This wasn’t what I’d expected. I glanced at the other chairs.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I got into a more comfortable position in the little booth, leaning against the window and taking a moment to digest what Mrs. Yamada had shared. Someone else walked into the dark little shop, going straight to the counter, their eyes on the desserts behind the display.</p>
<p>“Group therapy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“With the full-time position I’m taking with the Wardens, I have the chance to help a lot of critical individuals. The people I’ll be helping will be people who can help a lot of people in turn. An incredible number, in some cases. As attached as I am to my current patient caseload, and as much as I would like to take you on as a patient, it made the most sense to go this route.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>She frowned a little.</p>
<p>“But?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The role I held between Gold Morning and now was always going to be a transient one. My patients and everyone else involved knew I was only seeing the patients I’m seeing now in a temporary way. I’m one of several therapists who are rotating through a patient caseload, and only half were my patients and mine alone. In making a transition, it is and was still my responsibility to look after those exclusive patients.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” I connected that thought to how she’d found a therapist for me. When it was a chore to get therapists to take new patients, it amounted to a pretty meaningful gesture.</p>
<p>“I’m referring the ones I can to other therapists. I’m in touch with twelve people who work with parahumans and a few who are breaking into that field. Not a single one of us is working less than seventy hours a week. Some of my patients didn’t need counseling anymore, and I was only helping them to find their equilibrium after Gold Morning. Others are on their way to a new facility in this world’s Europe, which they’ve been anticipating for over a year now. If you were still in the same condition as you were when I first met you, I would be recommending you go there.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I didn’t like thinking about it.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t find places for everyone, and I’d turn down the job before I abandoned patients in need. With the remainder, I saw common ground among them. Not all of them, but enough of them that it seemed like things could be workable. Some supplied, needed, or were looking into the same kinds of assistance, which is what prompted the line of thinking. I was going to introduce them regardless, I could see them talking, and I thought it would be best to have the initial and deeper talks in a supervised setting.”</p>
<p>“And from there, it was a short jump to thinking about group therapy.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Group therapy, <i>interpersonal</i> group therapy, seemed appropriate for what I wanted them to address with each of them. It meant that in the time before I took on my full-time role with the Wardens, I could devote more time to more of them. In an ideal world, if there were some who still needed attention by the time I was done, I could call in favors or find places for them.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “Was it group therapy like I was a part of?”</p>
<p>“The therapy you were a part of was encounter-driven. Different. More involved, more simulations, acting and role-playing, confrontation, learning assertiveness as opposed to, say, aggressive behavior, or overly passive behavior. Engaging with peers.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really do anything except sit there.”</p>
<p>“But you wrote the scripts. You listened to the others, and you visualized ways you wanted the conversations to go. I got the impression it was pretty intense, even when you were a step removed in your participation.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. A large part of what I’d contributed to those sessions had played into my last interaction with my mom.</p>
<p>Not that that interaction had gone well, but I could imagine that if I’d found myself in that same situation without the grounding of knowledge from those sessions, I might not have had the words to articulate as much of what I’d wanted to. It was even possible that, without the conflict resolution skills, I might have hurt someone.</p>
<p>The recollections of the therapy and of my mom were heavy, pressing down on me and my chest. I took a long sip of my iced tea. It was cold and sensory, pulling me away from that rabbit hole of dark thoughts.</p>
<p>“This group was intended to be slower-paced, less intense,” she said.</p>
<p>“Even with the time constraint?”</p>
<p>“Yes, even with. Part of it is that, as I said, it was the most appropriate for what I wanted to address.”</p>
<p>“Part?”</p>
<p>“The other part ties back to what I said about introductions, how the first meetings are the trickiest. It was a delicate balancing act to begin with, compared to your group, where we added someone new once every few weeks or months, while the rest of the group remained fairly stable. With this group, having them all meet at once, I thought it would be best to keep things calmer.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense,” I said.</p>
<p>“My colleagues like to say there is a truism with groups of parahumans. That the larger the group in question, the greater the chance of a schism or disaster. I’m not sure I like exactly how the idea is presented a lot of the time it comes up, but…”</p>
<p>I thought of my sister.</p>
<p>“Groups of capes get pretty volatile,” I finished the sentence for her. “Each person you add is another chance for things to go wrong.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Three more members joined the group. An unknown boy and two people I knew, male and female.</p>
<p>When I realized who I was looking at, though, my jaw dropped. I stood from my chair.</p>
<p>She, for her part, was on a similar page. She stared at me, confused at first. Then reality dawned for her as well.</p>
<p>She was pale in a way that skin didn’t tend to be, and she had a mane of black hair. A small black tattoo marked her cheekbone, partially obscured by skin-tone makeup that had streaked in the rain. For all that she was almost monochrome from the neck up, she was a riot of color from the neck down. Sveta.</p>
<p>Her hands went to her mouth.</p>
<p>She closed the distance between us with a half-stagger, half-run kind of movement. I caught a glimpse of her tearing up before she threw her arms around me, colliding with me. I caught my bearings and hugged her back.</p>
<p>“You’re okay,” she mumbled into my shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m&mdash;” I started, lost for words. I looked at Weld, who stood in the doorway, smiling as wide as I’d ever seen him smile.</p>
<p>My arms still around her, I reached out with one hand, groping in Weld’s general direction, as if I could get the words that way.</p>
<p>“Fantastic,” Weld said. “This is perfect.”</p>
<p>He looked a little less neat than he’d been when I’d known him in Brockton Bay, but not as wild or ‘monstrous’ as I’d seen in the pictures online, back when he’d been a member of the Irregulars. His skin was dark iron, his eyes silver, veins of more silver tracing from the corners of the eyes. His hair was wire, made to look more free and unruly. He was wearing a henley shirt, khaki shorts and sandals that looked like they were made of metal and what might’ve been tire rubber. I couldn’t imagine any other material that would hold up when bearing the weight of someone that was heavy metal from head to toe.</p>
<p>Beside him was a guy, brown-skinned, with the sides and back of his hair cut short. The hair on top had to have been painted rather than dyed, because it was magenta, and I couldn’t imagine getting black hair <i>dyed</i> magenta without bleaching it to the point of destroying it, and the rolling curls retained their shape despite the droplets of rain that clung to it. He was smiling, but more because he looked like the type that very much enjoyed others being happy. The magenta-haired guy’s shirt was form-fitting to his upper body, showing off lean muscle, and looked like a surfer’s rash guard. He wore black shorts and sandals.</p>
<p>I turned my attention to the girl of the trio. I couldn’t believe it was Sveta.</p>
<p>Who was practically sobbing now, apparently.</p>
<p>Emotion was welling in my own chest. I put my hand on the back of her head, and I felt the hair stir, the tissues beneath the wig moving.</p>
<p>“Well, I think this has made my <i>everything,</i>” Weld said.</p>
<p>“Your everything?” the magenta-haired guy asked.</p>
<p>“Saying it made my day, my week, or even my month wouldn’t be enough,” Weld said, still smiling. “You’re okay, Victoria?”</p>
<p>“Two arms, two legs,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s great,” he said. “Sveta was so attached to you, she hated leaving you behind.”</p>
<p>Sveta nodded, head rubbing against my shoulder.</p>
<p>“And we’d thought you’d died,” Weld said. “When G.M. happened. Hearing you were alive was amazing on its own, but you’re… you’re <i>back. Fantastic.</i>”</p>
<p>Sveta made a sound, emotions pouring over, before hiccuping with a sob.</p>
<p>I stroked the back of her head, trusting that someone would tell me not to if it was dangerous.</p>
<p>Then again, I didn’t have my forcefield up.</p>
<p>I could have mentioned it. I didn’t.</p>
<p>“You have a body,” I whispered. I could feel it. It was hard, unyielding. She creaked in places, and the way she’d moved&mdash; the colors and textures I’d seen&mdash;</p>
<p>None of that mattered. She had a body.</p>
<p>“It took some doing,” Weld said. “It took a <i>lot</i> of doing. It’s been a whole adventure to get even this far. It’s not even tinkertech. Regular prosthetics and some inventiveness from some really stellar people. Arms, legs, body, some stuff to keep it upright, some machine learning systems that adapt to meet her partway, and a lot of practice on her part, to operate everything internal.”</p>
<p>Sveta pulled away. She looked me in the eye, reaching up to wipe at her tears. The hands didn’t seem cooperative enough, almost like someone holding a baseball bat by one end was trying to wipe away tears with the other.</p>
<p>I hesitated, before indicating her face. “Do you want a hand?”</p>
<p>She nodded, and I wiped the tears away with my fingers. She smiled, even as more welled up.</p>
<p>“You’re such a sneak, Jessica,” Weld said. “Not telling us?”</p>
<p>“I did tell you Victoria was recovered.”</p>
<p>“I thought you meant she was mobile enough to get to the meeting place on her own. I didn’t think you meant a complete and total recovery,” Weld said.</p>
<p>I wanted to turn to see Mrs. Yamada’s expression, but it was hard to move with Sveta hugging me. She was silent, though.</p>
<p>Behind Weld, someone else was ducking into the room. He looked like he was of a height with Kenzie, but given how boys developed slower, he might’ve been a touch older. He had a mess of tousled brown hair that would have been over his eyes if he wasn’t wearing large headphones as a kind of hairband. He had a very flat expression as he walked around the perimeter of the room. His t-shirt was black with a logo I didn’t recognize, his cargo shorts had stuff packed into the pockets, but he mostly looked like a very average kid. Only his old fashioned braces really stood out to me&mdash; the kind that made it hard for him to put his lips together.</p>
<p>Sveta twisted around, one hand reaching out to me to steady herself. She looked over at Kenzie, then at the magenta-haired fellow, and then at the new kid. She failed on her first attempt at speaking, then managed. “She was my first friend ever, that I can remember.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that,” I murmured.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have anyone, and&mdash; there was a time where I was cooped up in a sealed room in the hospital and stuff was going on outside, with the PRT and the other case fifty-threes. They introduced me to people who were harder for me to hurt. Victoria was one of them. I liked her, and she knew Weld, and she put up with me for some reason, so we kept talking and meeting.”</p>
<p>I leaned closer, whispering in her ear. “<i>For some reason? You helped keep me sane. You were my friend.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Stop it, dummy. You’re going to make me cry more,</i>” she whispered back. “<i>And I can’t believe I’m finally hearing your voice for real.</i>”</p>
<p>And with that last statement she was tearing up more.</p>
<p>“<i>Since when are you this much of a crier?</i>” I asked.</p>
<p>“<i>I’m all emotionally open and shit now,</i>” she whispered. “<i>Blame Weld. And blame yourself, being all normal and stuff.</i>”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I just caught you saying my name just now,” Weld said. “Maybe that’s my cue to duck out before you start badmouthing me.”</p>
<p>“I’d never ever badmouth you,” Sveta said, at normal volume. She’d turned to face him, and I held her arm to steady her as she swayed a bit. “What would I even say?”</p>
<p>“I hear people coming anyway,” Weld said. He stopped, looking at Sveta and me, then smiled wide. “This is fantastic.”</p>
<p>Sveta hugged my arm.</p>
<p>“You’ve said that a lot,” the Magenta-haired boy said.</p>
<p>“I can’t even begin to tell you,” Weld said. “In more than one way. I’ll leave it for Victoria to share.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we can chat another time,” the boy said. “We could hang out.”</p>
<p>“If Sveta, Victoria, and Jessica okay it,” Weld said, clapping a hand on the guy’s shoulder. “I don’t want to throw any wrenches into the therapy or make anything awkward by blurring lines.”</p>
<p>“Send me an email if you want to discuss it. It’s always good to see you, Weld,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“I’ll do that, and it’s good to see you too, Jessica. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to make the time to sit in.”</p>
<p>“Totally understandable. Good luck. We may run into each other if you stick with the Wardens.”</p>
<p>“Excellent,” Weld said. He glanced at us, delivering a wink probably more meant for Sveta than for me. “Fantastic. I’ll text you when I have an idea of what’s happening with my afternoon, Sveta.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>With a parting salute, he was gone.</p>
<p>I took my seat, giving my hand to Sveta, as she collapsed into the chair on the other side of me. Now that she wasn’t bear-hugging me, I could see that a lot of the color on her was that the prosthetic body she wore had been painted. Bumps and collisions had chipped some of the paint, but from the neck down, everything that wasn’t covered in clothing was painted in rolling waves, in sea serpents, birds and reptiles. The colors were bright and bold, like graffiti, the living things hot orange, the background cool blues and greens. Her clothes were relatively plain, a black top and brown pants, and looked to be relatively thick and durable, but the plain-ness was marred by the small streaks and smudges of paint that she’d gotten on it, most of it in long, thin slashes.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement put me between her and Kenzie. Kenzie, for the time being, was leaning over to the new addition to the group, the boy with braces. She seemed to be filling him in on what he’d missed.</p>
<p>“Tristan,” the magenta-haired boy said, approaching. He extended a hand. I shook it.</p>
<p>“Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Will your brother be joining us today?” Mrs. Yamada asked.</p>
<p>“I asked, he didn’t reply,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Brother?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Twin,” Tristan said. He pointed at his hair. “Part of the reason I make myself so easily identifiable. He’s Byron, he used to have blue-green hair to match me, but he quit doing that.”</p>
<p>“Good to know,” I said.</p>
<p>Blue hair.</p>
<p>I thought of my youngest cousin. Where Crystal had always had the red-magenta look, Eric had gone with the blue, dying his hair. It was a sad, wistful thought. With so many losses in recent memory, so much tumult, it felt very distant. That distance didn’t make it it feel any less painful. If I’d been burned on an hourly, daily or weekly basis for the last four years, the death of Eric and Uncle Neil would have been the very first time my hand was shoved down and held to the oven ring.</p>
<p>Alarming and hard to process in how devastating and raw it had been, <i>important</i>, but still a very long time ago.</p>
<p>I changed up my focus, “You all came in together. Are you friends?”</p>
<p>“No. Or kind of?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Tristan explained, “I ran into Weld and Sveta on the way into the first session. He dropped her off at the front door because he had a place to be, and I offered my arm. Sveta and I geeked out together over Weld.”</p>
<p>“He’s geek-out worthy,” I said.</p>
<p>Tristan smiled. “Does the impromptu Weld fan club have another member?”</p>
<p>“Nah,” I said. “No, I’m just a fan in a very mundane way. I think he’s a good guy.”</p>
<p>Sveta nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>“At our first meeting, Tristan kept saying he was Weld’s number one fan,” Kenzie joined in.</p>
<p>“Oh, that. Don’t remind me,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I won’t, then,” Kenzie said, deflating a little.</p>
<p>Tristan sighed, glancing at the rest of the room. “Nah, it’s no good to leave our guest in the lurch, and I’m supposed to be holding myself accountable. You might as well share, I’ll take my licks.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Kenzie said, perking up considerably at the same time Tristan withered. “So Tristan kept saying it, casually mentioning the posters he had before, and he had merchandise.”</p>
<p>“Weld figurine, from his stint in the Boston Wards. One where he was wearing his first costume, too,” Tristan said. “I miss that thing.”</p>
<p>“I want one,” Sveta said. “Would it be weird if I had one?”</p>
<p>Kenzie continued, “So he kept saying all that, because he was so psyched he got to meet Weld. Then Sveta finally speaks up, and she was very quiet when she said it, but she said ‘I probably have you beat.’”</p>
<p>“I’m competitive,” Tristan said. “So I was pretty adamant that no, no she didn’t.”</p>
<p>Sveta looked like she was on top of the world, smiling to herself. She wiped at her face with one prosthetic hand&mdash; she still had tracks of tears on her face. I leaned closer, whispering. “Want a tissue?”</p>
<p>She nodded. I stood from my seat while the conversation continued.</p>
<p>“…And she says she’s his girlfriend,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Tristan sighed. “Yep.”</p>
<p>“She’s living with him, and they sleep in the same bed, and they make each other breakfast,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>I liked the mental image. I liked that Sveta was smiling as much as she was.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to beat that,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I collected a tissue from Mrs. Yamada’s desk, glancing at her. She seemed pretty unbothered by this, so far.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s about winning,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I handed the tissue to Sveta as I retook my seat, and she set about patting her cheeks dry. A little bit more of the cover-up makeup came away from the tattoo.</p>
<p>“Yeahhhh,” Tristan drew out the word. He added, “Easy to say when you’re the clear winner.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“That’s a joke, by the way. I’m not being serious here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Sveta said. “I was wondering there.”</p>
<p>Another person had entered the room. A boy, Caucasian, with shoulder-length brown-blond hair. He had a cut under one eye and another cut on the bridge of his nose. His jeans were ripped at the knee and his shirt was baggy, a size too big for him. The sleeves were long, red where the torso was white, and they had been rolled up to the elbow. His sneakers had seen a lot of abuse, by the looks of it. The white parts were brown and grey in a way that made me suspicious that even a thorough cleaning wouldn’t get them purely white again. He looked sixteen or seventeen.</p>
<p>“But yeah, damn, I don’t look good enough in a dress, so I have to concede. Hey Rain,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Heya,” the boy who was apparently called ‘Rain’ said. He took the empty seat next to Tristan. “Why are you wearing a dress?”</p>
<p>“Just joking around.”</p>
<p>There were still two empty seats. One would be Jessica’s. There’d be one more, then.</p>
<p>“You made it here okay?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I got a ride.”</p>
<p>“How are things?” Kenzie asked Rain. She gestured at her head in a way I didn’t see, with her head blocking my view of the hand on the other side.</p>
<p>Rain seemed to take a second to ponder it. He frowned a little. “Not great.”</p>
<p>“Better or worse than last week?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Let’s save the therapy-relevant stuff for the session,” Mrs. Yamada interrupted. “Small talk and catching up for now, please. We don’t want to get started before everyone’s here, and I want to go over ground rules and expectations before we ask anything too personal.”</p>
<p>Kenzie smiled and shrugged, settling back into her seat, hands in her lap.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Rain said. He turned his attention to me. “This is the heroine?”</p>
<p>“Ex&mdash;, kind of,” I said. “But yeah. Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Hi. I’m Rain. Spelled like the water that falls from the sky.”</p>
<p>“Cape or civilian name?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I hate that you have to ask. Civilian. And before you comment on it, yeah, I know. It’s unusual, I’ve heard the jokes.”</p>
<p>He’d said it as if his patience on the subject had run short a long time ago. I threw up my hands in mock surrender, my mouth firmly shut.</p>
<p>He said, “You said ex, but you didn’t sound sure. Are you taking a break? Or…?”</p>
<p>“Trying to get back into it after a break, but ended up taking another short break to focus on some background stuff. Getting a handle on things.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said, as if I’d said something very heavy, and he’d felt part of that weight. “I feel like I’ve been trying to get a handle on things since I got my powers.”</p>
<p>“For a while now, then? If I can ask?”</p>
<p>“Just under a year ago,” he said. “I think, along with Chris, I’m the rookie here.”</p>
<p>Post-Gold Morning. That helped put things in context.</p>
<p>Chris, too. By process of elimination, he’d be the boy roughly Kenzie’s age.</p>
<p>“Family thing. You said that once,” Kenzie said. Rain acknowledged that with a nod.</p>
<p>“Second gen?” I asked. I wondered if I had any kindred on that front.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of questions you can ask about the parahuman stuff,” he said. “When it comes to me, the answer to most of them is ‘it’s complicated’.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair,” I said. “For a while now I’ve thought that parahumans should get a membership card, materializing in our hands when we trigger, or arriving in the mail at the first opportunity. A warning on one side, ‘handle with care’, and then on the other side, ‘shit is complicated, don’t ask’. Something that we can flash now and again, like a get out of jail free card.”</p>
<p>“Mine would be worn out, both sides,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I could get good mileage out of the ‘shit is complicated’ side,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Now I feel left out,” Kenzie said. “I’d like to think mine would be nice and neat, stored away as a just-in-case.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Tristan asked. “<i>Really</i>?”</p>
<p>“Ruh-heally,” Kenzie said, with exaggerated emphasis and a roll of the eyes. Tristan mirrored her pose some.</p>
<p>“I do like the idea,” Rain said. “The card.”</p>
<p>Rain wasn’t a smiler, by the looks of it, but he’d seemed to relax more as I talked to him.</p>
<p>“By the way, I should have asked, am I allowed to swear?” I asked, twisting around to face Mrs. Yamada.</p>
<p>“Swearing is fine In moderation,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Being here wouldn’t be nearly as positive if you couldn’t say what you wanted to say. There’s a point where swearing takes away from the communication and expression I’m hoping to see, where you hide behind the swearing, or where it’s disruptive. I think you six have a good sense of where that point is. I may referee if we get close to it.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said.</p>
<p>“I remember the group therapy session we had back at the hospital,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. Sveta had only been there for the initial sessions. She’d left, I’d stayed. “Plenty of swearing. But it was different, and we didn’t have any kids in the group.”</p>
<p>“Well, not young kids,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I looked over at Kenzie and Chris. “Will I be overstepping or bothering you if I call you kids? I’m not sure where the comfort zones are.”</p>
<p>Kenzie snorted. “It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” Chris said, “Hospital? You were at the Asylum?”</p>
<p>He’d barely hesitated a second. He’d been so quiet up until now, and then the moment I’d given him an avenue to join the conversation, he went straight from negation to asking questions.</p>
<p>Not pleasant questions either.</p>
<p>“Oh. Sorry,” Sveta said, to me. “I should have thought you might not want to broadcast it. I’m sorry. I kind of brought it up earlier, too.”</p>
<p>On its own, it was something I could handle most of the time, but it might have been a return to the group therapy session, the presence of Sveta and Mrs. Yamada, even, and possibly the fact that I’d had a few reminders and it was harder and harder to surface, while it almost felt like Chris was pressing down.</p>
<p>Dark, uncomfortable memories stirred. Being paralyzed, silent, the interminable restlessness. The way the things on the television and radio had been almost unbearable to see and listen to, not because of the subject matter, but because of my inability to change the channel or shut it off, even though I’d asked for it to be put on in the first place.</p>
<p>I had to take a second to swallow and remember normal breathing and cadence again, after thinking about it.</p>
<p>“Let’s not put too much pressure on Victoria, please,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I understand that you might feel the need to vet her or figure out if you can trust her, and that makes sense, given the degree of what’s shared here, but let’s be fair. Let’s keep the small talk small, I’ll outline things as we start, and you can decide if you’re uncomfortable. If you are, then we’ll figure out a way to move forward.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“If you’re sure.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” I said, glad I was able to find and use a normal tone of voice without any giveaway. I turned back to Chris, “Yeah. I was there. Arrived midway through twenty-eleven, year and a half, and then the Asylum-supported housing after.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Chris said. “Brockton Bay before that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I wondered for a second at his jumping to the conclusion, before I remembered I had the city and its name on my dress.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of Brockton Bay in the news, before,” he observed.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Not a lot of it good.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how to approach the conversation with Chris. He was hard to read, in fashion, in expression&mdash; I’d glance at his mouth to see if he was smiling or frowning and I’d only see the braces. He’d been quiet up until now, too, which meant I didn’t have a lot to go on.</p>
<p>Something about him bothered me. It wasn’t just the slant of his questions or the way it felt like they were pressing at me, but his demeanor, and little things about his appearance I couldn’t put my finger on. The messiness of his hair was one of those things. It looked like he had three cowlicks &mdash; two at either corner of his hairline and one by his temple. With his hair pushed back by the headphones he hadn’t taken off, they looked a little like small bald patches with the way the hair splayed out from those points. He held his hands with his fingers curled in. It was offputting in a mild way that lined up with how he came hitting me with those uncomfortable, prying questions and comments.</p>
<p>I wondered if he was one of the ones Mrs. Yamada had been worried about, as part of this group. One of the additions that catalyzed something volatile.</p>
<p>That might have been unfair.</p>
<p>“Weld was there for a lot of it,” Sveta said, backing me up. “I’ve heard some of what happened. Things got scary.”</p>
<p>In all fairness, as fond as I was of her, I did find something amusing in how it was Sveta saying that last bit. “Scary’s a good way to put it.”</p>
<p>“But you’re still wearing the shirt,” Rain observed. “You’re attached to the city.”</p>
<p>“Sure. It’s my city. I grew up there.”</p>
<p>“But you admit it was scary?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“The city isn’t defined by what happened to it. Just like we aren’t the bad experiences that happen to us,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t we?” Chris asked, leaning forward in his seat, elbows on his knees. “We’re the sum of the things that have happened to us, good or bad.”</p>
<p>“We aren’t,” I said, firmly. Then, on a moment’s reflection, I added, “We can’t be. There’s a lot of other things going into it.”</p>
<p>“You’re making me think back to science class,” Rain said. “I sucked at science. What was it? Nature or nurture?”</p>
<p>“Nature versus nurture, yeah,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” Rain said. “I should have remembered that. Are you all about the nature, then?”</p>
<p>I thought of my family. <i>I’m not sure that’s much better.</i> </p>
<p>Amy had agonized over that one.<i><br>
</i></p>
<p>“We’re getting into territory that’s close to being therapy again,” Mrs. Yamada said, rescuing me from the line of thinking. “So I’m going to interrupt. But it’s a good point to keep in mind for our discussions later today. I’m keeping an eye on the clock, and we’re ready to start.”</p>
<p><i>Sounds good</i>, I thought. I glanced at the empty chairs.</p>
<p>She walked around the perimeter of the room, stopping when she stood behind one of the empty chairs. “Let me recap for our visitor and remind the rest of the group what I said at the start of the first session. This particular type of group therapy focuses on self-reflection, effective socializing, supporting each other, helping to problem solve, and examining the patterns we fall into, both the constructive and the problematic. Each of you has spent some time with me working on these things, and this is the platform where we put a lot of that into practice.”</p>
<p>“<i>My</i> role in this, Victoria, is to be the referee and the coach. I’ll try to ensure everyone gets their turn and has a voice. I’ll try to head off or steer the discussion if it gets into less constructive territory, and to keep things moving if needed. I’ll be chiming in periodically to ensure that confidentiality is stressed. I’ve had Victoria review the same materials I gave the rest of you.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“While I can promise you confidentiality on my part, and while I’ll encourage you all to maintain it, I can’t guarantee it. If any of you were to pursue villainous activities, the other members of the group could be compelled to testify against you.”</p>
<p>The final member of the group entered the room. She was somewhere between eighteen and twenty, but her height might have been deceiving. Her white hair was long enough to reach the small of her back, her irises especially pale or similarly white, and she wore a black dress with a dozen straps overlapping in an intricate way at the shoulders and back. The hem of the dress was damaged at one end. Threads frayed, polyester melted, with a noticeable hole in it.</p>
<p>“Hi, boss,” Kenzie said, a twinkle of mischief in her eye as Mrs. Yamada gave her a stern look.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you could make it, Ashley,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I’ve spent the last minute or two going over the basics, reminding others about the aims of the group and how confidentiality works in a group session.”</p>
<p>“To fill in our guest?” ‘Ashley’ asked. She went straight to the table at the side of the room where a pitcher of water and paper cups were arranged, pouring herself a glass.</p>
<p>“Yes. Her name is Victoria. If you’ll take a seat, I’ll bring you anything else you need, but I’d like for everyone to be seated so I can continue.”</p>
<p>Ashley walked around behind me and circled the perimeter of the group to reach one of the empty seats. She swept her hand behind her to brush her dress to one side, so it wouldn’t bunch up awkwardly beneath her as she took a seat on one of the two chairs between Rain and Chris.</p>
<p>She stared at me. Maybe it would have been better to say she stared me down.</p>
<p>I, meanwhile, was left to digest the mistake of Mrs. Yamada’s that I was here to help address. I was ninety-five percent sure I knew who ‘Ashley’ was when she was in costume, and I was left to take that knowledge and see how it fit together with the issue at hand.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada continued, “Use your own discretion when deciding what to share. You’ve all agreed to participate, knowing the risks and difficulties inherent. I’m hopeful this will be a positive set of exercises. I think that more or less sums it up. I suspect Victoria’s presence and the fact you’ve all had a week to think about what we talked about last session means you’ll have some questions.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty late to be bringing her in,” Ashley said. “Is she joining the group?”</p>
<p>“We hadn’t planned on her joining, per se,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I invited her because she’s exceptionally well equipped to address the topics that came up last session. We’ll build on it and you can decide what you’re willing to share here. During our next and final session, depending on your comfort levels and how much you want to carry on today’s discussion, she may or may not be in attendance, or not for the full duration.”</p>
<p>“Is it really an ‘issue’?” Tristan asked, making air quotes.</p>
<p>“I think it could be. Victoria can expand on why, shortly.”</p>
<p>“Are we supposed to know who she is?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>I glanced at Mrs. Yamada. She was taking her seat between Ashley and Chris. From the gesture in my direction, and the fact that she wasn’t stepping in, the ‘referee’ was leaving the ball in my court.</p>
<p>“I’m Victoria Dallon. If you study Parahumans, my family comes up, because it’s a literal textbook case of powers running in families. I… believe you’ve run into my family, Ashley.”</p>
<p>“Have I? I’ve met so many capes it’s hard to keep track.”</p>
<p>“Do you know New Wave?” I asked. “White bodysuits, symbols in colors?”</p>
<p>“I know a few people like that. I didn’t always pay attention to names.”</p>
<p>“Would’ve been in Boston. The slang term in the ‘scene’ was the Boston Games.”</p>
<p>Ashley smiled for the first time.</p>
<p>For the rest of the room, I explained, keeping half of an eye on Mrs. Yamada, to make sure I wasn’t overstepping. “A series of arrests in Boston saw a shift in the power balance of local gangs. That’s a pretty common thing, but the Protectorate team followed up on it hard, toppling just about every major and most minor gangs and villains in the city, leaving a void that was bigger than usual. Villains of every power level and stripe flocked to the city, villains in neighboring cities had a vested interest in having a foothold there as a place to retreat to or a place to expand, and it became an entangled nightmare of villain politics and power plays.”</p>
<p>“Time of my life,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Heroes, like the PRT, and like my family’s team, followed, to try and keep the peace until things settled. My family’s team was Lady Photon, Manpower, Flashbang, Brandish, Lightstar and Fleur.”</p>
<p>“The heroes without masks,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“I remember them. I was one of the villains who flocked,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>That confirmed that she was Damsel of Distress then. B-list villain, chronic headache for the PRT of yesteryear, unpredictable, dangerous, unstable, and fortunately, she’d been more of a problem for herself than for others. She had been recruited by the Slaughterhouse Nine, to pad their numbers, and had died shortly after.</p>
<p>Her history was one of self-sabotage punctuated by events every two or three years where she was cause for alarm. She had thrived during the Boston Games, in a sense, enough to get her name out there to capes in Northeastern America as a just in case.</p>
<p>She’d later found a place in the Nine. She was of a particular brand or species of cape, who somehow rose up when everything else was sinking. It almost made a degree of sense, then, that in following with that pattern, she’d risen up from the grave at the same time the entire <i>world</i> was plunged into chaos.</p>
<p>Kenzie was saying something, and I was having trouble tuning in.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouse Nine meant Bonesaw. Crawler. That in turn led me to think about my last coherent, <i>me</i> moments, the blank in my memories, the aftermath. It made me think about actual monsters, and the very real possibility that Ashley was one.</p>
<p>“Were you there?”</p>
<p>It took me a second to connect with Ashley’s question.</p>
<p>“If you’re uncomfortable getting into it, we could change the subject,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“Could I just get some water, actually? Sorry, you meant Boston, Ashley?”</p>
<p>“Yes. During the Boston Games,” Ashley said, as Mrs. Yamada stood and went to get the water.</p>
<p>“I was a little too young. I followed along back at home, where we made the dining room into a kind of headquarters, putting up a few bulletin boards. I colored in the maps and moved pins as the territories changed hands while doing homework and stuff. Is it a problem?”</p>
<p>“No,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“What are your thoughts on the subject, Victoria?” Mrs. Yamada asked, handing me the water.</p>
<p>I drank before answering.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Boston was mostly fine,” I said. “My family didn’t get hurt. To me, she was just a pin on the map of Boston we had in the living room&mdash;”</p>
<p>I saw Damsel’s expression shift. A slight narrowing of the eyes.</p>
<p>“&mdash;And a few interesting and impressive stories my aunt, uncle, and dad brought home.”</p>
<p>That amended the narrowing. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>“Good,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I’m glad to hear that. Questions, thoughts, observations? Anyone?”</p>
<p>Ashley wasn’t done with the questions and comments. The words she spoke next were an accusation, and she was very good at sounding accusatory. “You brought her here to change our minds.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Our conversation stalled as a waitress wiped down a table behind Jessica. I swished the ice around my now mostly empty glass.</p>
<p>“I never liked the codenames,” Jessica said.</p>
<p>“We might be very different people in that. There’s something fun about them. They’re revealing.”</p>
<p>“They are, but they often reveal just how badly the patient wants to escape, to leave their humanity behind and dive into something well beyond humanity. Some don’t surface completely. Some hurt others on the way down. Some drown in that vast, incomprehensible sea.”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath, then sighed. “Feeling poetic?”</p>
<p>“My own kind of escapism, maybe. I think sometimes about a world where all of my patients can go by their real names.”</p>
<p>“I’m not following the train of thought, I’m afraid.”</p>
<p>“I arranged the group therapy. I thought for a long time about whether any of my patients were a significant danger to the others, or if they’d set the therapy of their peers back. I took precautions, I pored over the notes, trying to visualize how things might go, or the topics that I could safely broach or go back to. Like I said, the first meetings are hard.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I can imagine that.”</p>
<p>“And while I don’t like the way the idea is often interpreted or the conclusions it’s taken to, there’s the notion of volatility, and the exponentially increasing chance of trouble as the groups of capes grow larger. With parahumans, things are often exaggerated, both in weak points or the hot button issues they have, or their inclination to push certain buttons. The more you put in one place, the higher the chance of the wrong button being pushed. That was another concern of mine.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “How long has the group been running?”</p>
<p>“Two months and a week, with one or two sessions a week, as situations allow. We’re not quite at the end, but it’s close. This was supposed to be the easy middle stretch.”</p>
<p>“Supposed to be? You let your guard down?”</p>
<p>“In a way. Maybe from the beginning,” Jessica said.</p>
<p>She looked genuinely bothered. I held my tongue.</p>
<p>She went on, “I spent so much time anticipating and planning for disaster, that I failed to see the other side of that coin. I didn’t want to think of them as <i>capes</i>. I sought out the things that would help them connect and find reasons to listen to one another.”</p>
<p>I realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Jessica was nodding to herself. “That was my mistake. We were approaching the end stretch, and I reminded them of the date we would wrap up and finish. The conversation took a turn, and I was caught flat-footed. They expressed interest in staying together. They want to found a team.”</p>
<p>“A team of?”</p>
<p>“Heroes, it sounds like.”</p>
<p>“Is that so bad?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Without going into any particular detail, Victoria, several are troubled, vulnerable, or both. No, I don’t think it’s good.”</p>

<p>“It’s not my intent to change your minds,” I said. I could see some skeptical looks on some faces as I looked around the circle. “I’m here to give another perspective, and maybe to equip you guys with knowledge. If you change your minds because of that&mdash; and I think Mrs. Yamada might be hoping for that, then that’s fine. If not, then I’d hope you were all going into this with your eyes more open about what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>“I’ve addressed my feelings with the group,” Mrs. Yamada said. “At the end of the session where the topic first came up, and for a portion of the last session. We had other things demanding our attention, so we weren’t able to cover it in any depth.”</p>
<p>“That would be me,” Rain said, raising a hand.</p>
<p>Jessica continued, “To abbreviate what I said then, and to reinforce it in the here and now: if you each carried on as you have been until the final group sessions concluded, then moved on from there with the skills and perspective you’ve gained, I think most of you would do fine. Most of you have reached the points in your journeys where you could continue on your own, without needing the one-on-one therapy or the group sessions. You could pursue more conventional therapy, I think anyone could, and you would have my number in case of emergencies or backsliding, but most of you would do fine.”</p>
<p>“Ready to be let loose into the urban wilds,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Not all of us though,” Kenzie said. “You said most, a few times.”</p>
<p>“Most,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I also had private discussions with several members of the group. I won’t say what was discussed, or with whom, but no, I don’t think everyone is ready.”</p>
<p>The group was silent. I assumed nobody wanted to speak up because they felt like doing so would out them as one of the people who’d had one of those private conversations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada went on, “More to the point, beyond any and all of that, I don’t think the group would necessarily be healthy, taken outside of this setting and function.”</p>
<p>“You gathered us together so we could support each other,” Sveta said. “I feel like we do a good job of that. We bring out the good sides of one another.”</p>
<p>“In this setting, yes, I have seen that,” Jessica said. “I’m gratified it’s been so positive for most of you. But that’s in a controlled setting, with a mediator to keep things on course and help recognize the sensitive subjects and steer away from them.”</p>
<p>“May I?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Please,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Feel free.”</p>
<p>“To build on what you said, I think the things I’ve noticed on the those fronts are that, well, it’s a big leap from the controlled setting of a place like this to the wild, uncontrolled setting of superheroics. Things will get bad at some point, and when they do, there’s a tendency for the bad to snowball.”</p>
<p>“You lived in Brockton Bay,” Tristan said. “Is it possible your sense of normal is skewed?”</p>
<p>“That’s&mdash; that’s honestly hard to respond to,” I said. I didn’t miss the flicker of a smile on Tristan’s face at hearing that. “Because there’s an answer that springs to mind that I could give you, but I don’t know where people’s limits are, I don’t want to step on toes or upset anyone by giving an example.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about the others, but I can’t think of what you’d say that would potentially upset us,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I can,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Rain leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “I’m making a pretty big leap here, but it’s the response that jumped to mind for me, too. I’ve been here from the start, I think I know where everyone’s at. I think it’s okay to say it, but do you mean Gold Morning? I could see where it would be sensitive, considering just about everyone lost someone, but I don’t think that’s going to push anyone in particular over the edge, here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That was it, thank you,” I said. I looked past Sveta to Tristan. “What happened in Brockton Bay wasn’t a break from the pattern. It was just the pattern playing out at an accelerated rate. What I’m talking about, the snowballing, the bad things happening and then compounding each other… they still happened. A whole lot of individual factors played into the events of that day, and into the engagements and infighting that followed.”</p>
<p>“When they happen more slowly, there’s time to rest,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“When they happen slowly, there’s time to get used to the bad, to normalize it. You or people you thought you knew change in reaction to those external factors without anyone realizing it and… things still compound. The bad days come, and the unresolved stuff from the last bad days catches up or demands resolution.”</p>
<p>“Like Gold Morning, again,” Rain said. “A lot of things caught up with us around then. Or a lot of things converged to bring it about, maybe. I wasn’t there so I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“I was only there for the later parts,” I said. “But I think you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Things are better this time,” Sveta said. “We’ve learned from mistakes. It’s a fresh start. The Endbringers are dormant, we’re finally building things without them being torn down all the time.”</p>
<p>“I agree with Sveta,” Tristan said. “I really think there is a lot of work to be done before we get to a good normal, but that’s where I want to be out there doing some of that work in the best way I know how, with people I’ve come to know, like, and respect.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like being on the opposite side of an argument from you, Victoria,” Sveta said. “It doesn’t feel good.”</p>
<p>I reached out for her hand. She met me halfway, putting the prosthetic hand in mine. I squeezed it, realized she might not be able to feel the squeeze, and gave it a waggle. She smiled.</p>
<p>“No hard feelings, okay?” I said. “I get it. You want this. Believe me when I say I want to get out and do some heroic stuff too.”</p>
<p>“I have a boyfriend I feel like I don’t deserve, and please don’t use that as a launchpad to get into another topic, Mrs. Yamada.”</p>
<p>“I’m keeping my mouth shut for the time being,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>Sveta nodded. She looked back at me. “I missed out on most of my teenage years, I don’t remember my childhood, and I feel so behind.”</p>
<p>“I know. Believe me, I get it, not to the same degree, but I share some of those same feelings,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know you do,” she said. She gave me a waggle back.</p>
<p>“I think more than a few of us get it,” Tristan said. “Losing years or losing time because we have to deal with shit other people don’t, and falling behind because of it.”</p>
<p>Sveta nodded. “My boyfriend is out and around and he’s doing great work. He’s been doing it for a while. He tried to build something with the Irregulars and it went bad. But now he’s out there again and he’s with <em>the</em> team, the top team I know about, he’s doing amazing stuff. I don’t know if I can ever catch up, but I don’t want to not try. I don’t want to let the gap widen.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be just about him, you know,” I said. “I think that would be more poison than help for a relationship.”</p>
<p>“It’s not. Well, I mean, it is, but it’s not about him in a him-and-me romantic sense, it’s about me and him&mdash; sorry, I’m not making sense.”</p>
<p>“I’m following okay,” I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada said, “Just take your time, find the words.”</p>
<p>“Back long before I even knew him, he was my reference point for figuring out where we are. We being the C-fifty-threes. If he was popular then we all had a shot at getting more popularity. That was something I could hope I could have one day. And I didn’t have a lot of hope, so it was important.”</p>
<p>I reached over, and gave her arm a solid pat. I was still holding her hand.</p>
<p>“And we spent part of the summer touring other worlds. We were looking for our places of birth, but mostly we were looking for mine. I’m one of the only ones who remembers mine.”</p>
<p>She moved one hand over to tap a finger against her forearm. In dark green, almost invisible as a series of dark green images between dark blue sky and dark blue waves, framed by leaping fish in neon orange, were a series of huts.</p>
<p>“I was waiting for some updates on my body and so we just had me in my hamster ball, and Weld is so great, so patient… but I don’t like being that dependent. I want to be self-sufficient and I want to do it by being a hero.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s kind of the opposite of the toxic path,” Tristan said. “You’ve talked about it before, Sveta, how you’re worried about how your world revolves around him.”</p>
<p>Sveta nodded. “When you’re disabled, and I see myself as disabled, then your world gets smaller. Things get harder. It’s easy to become dependent or let down your guard. Everything’s hard and it’s really easy to stop trying altogether, to rely on people who want to help, to do what Victoria said and normalize that behavior and let the toxicity seep into things, only to have it come to a head during an already bad day.”</p>
<p>“I’m just going to cut in here,” I said. “I one hundred percent think what you’re saying is cool and good. It’s a good mindset. I did catch one thing you said and it made me think. You said ‘self-sufficient’ and one of the things I was thinking about mentioning was, you know, heroing is hard, and it’s kind of hard in part because it doesn’t pay. That can lead to self-insufficiency instead.”</p>
<p>“It <em>can</em> pay,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“It can,” I said. “But it paid in part because people wanted to put money toward it. Because the governments backed it and put money into the PRT, which paid the heroes a decent wage with opportunities for more. I spent my entire life seeing my mom stressing out in front of the computer or in front of the paperwork, from the time I could walk to the time I went to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“It can absolutely pay, though,” Tristan said. He glanced at Mrs. Yamada and then said, “I was a member of a corporate team, I saw and participated in the fundraising and merchandising, and we did well. We made a good bit of money.”</p>
<p>“Which team?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Reach.”</p>
<p>“Oh, kudos. I know Reach,” I said. “I’m not sure I could list off the roster as of Gold Morning but I’m more than passingly familiar. Good team.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Tristan said. “I mean, I’m not so worried about the money. That’s the easy part.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s easy at all,” I said. “There’s a saying, um, seventy percent of couples break up because of financial issues. The same number of cape teams break up because of the same.”</p>
<p>“What’s so hard about it?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“You’re providing a service, and the fruits of that service aren’t immediately tangible. If you do everything right, get crime rates down, clean up the neighborhood, then people look at the clean streets and low crime rate and they wonder why they’re paying you. If the crime rate stays high and things are a mess, then they wonder why they’re paying you.”</p>
<p>“How do you get around that?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“You show your work,” I said. “And you show it in a way that makes people believe you’re doing a good job. Bringing in bad guys, getting on the front page, that’s a big one, but you have to factor in the work of maintaining a relationship with the media, marketing, on top of the work you’re already doing. You can also get into fights the public is aware of, while not putting that public in danger, because putting people in danger means getting sued.”</p>
<p>“Which detracts from the finances,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“In a big way,” I said.</p>
<p>“Like prison rep,” Ashley said. “Having to show you’re not to be messed with, without making such a mess that you add to your sentence.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Not an analogy I would have jumped to, but it’s a good one.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t aware you went to prison,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Ashley said, fixing Sveta with a level stare. “I watch tv and read books.”</p>
<p>I was going to reply to that, but Tristan was already talking. He said, “I’m not worried about the money side of things. P.R., rep, image, media, I had advice and lessons from masters in the field, when it came to that.”</p>
<p>“From what I remember of Reach, I believe you,” I said. “I do think that there’s a ton of difference between launching a new team and capitalizing on an established brand like Reach had, and between being the man in front of the cameras and the person in the background paying the bills.”</p>
<p>“I have to ask,” Ashley said. She waited for me to look at her before speaking. “What are your qualifications exactly? You were on a struggling team?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to bully Victoria, please,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> feeling the numbers disadvantage, with many things I was saying having two people responding, a number of changes in direction, and the periodic challenging questions. Mrs. Yamada hadn’t spoken up recently.</p>
<p>“I’m a cape geek,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re all cape geeks,” Tristan said. “It comes with the territory of being a cape.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m a cape geek of a tier higher,” I said. “Listen, my mom and dad were capes and they were talking shop around me since I was born. My aunt, uncle, cousins&mdash; my entire immediate and pretty much my whole extended family, they were all capes. I was giving interviews about what it was like to grow up with hero parents when I was ten.”</p>
<p>Tristan cut in, “Okay, but that doesn’t&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Hold on,” I said. “I was asked, I’m answering. I triggered at fourteen, I was patrolling within six months. I had three years of time as Glory Girl, one Endbringer fight, and&mdash;”</p>
<p>I paused.</p>
<p>Sveta squeezed my hand.</p>
<p>“&mdash;And one run-in with the Slaughterhouse Nine, followed by almost two years in the hospital.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Ashley. She hadn’t flinched at the mention of the Nine.</p>
<p>I went on, “I’ve seen some of the worst. I had the best boyfriend in the world&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You had the second best,” Sveta said. “I’ll fight you on this.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you up on that another time,” I said. I smiled. “Some of my family members were some of the most amazing people, one of those family members is still with me, and I count myself lucky in that. I was a local celebrity, and I got letters from kids saying they were inspired or I’d improved their lives by reaching out to them, spending a bit of time with them, or helping them off a bad path through nothing more than me existing. With all of that, I think I can say I’ve experienced some of the best that being a hero has to offer, too.”</p>
<p>“What happened to the others?” Kenzie asked. “The other family members?”</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said. “It’s best to leave that be.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Kenzie said. “I didn’t mean to pry. I’m really sorry, Victoria, for your losses. I asked because I’ve lost people too. I know it hurts, and I think you’re cool and you don’t deserve that hurt.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kenzie. I’ll share, because I think it’s important for context. We’ve all lost people and that’s a big part of our shared experience here on Earth Gimel.”</p>
<p>I saw people throughout the room nodding, or acknowledging that. Interesting, to see the lone wolf villainess Ashley nod, too. Chris, Tristan, Sveta. Mrs. Yamada.</p>
<p>Rain was hard to read, but he looked introspective.</p>
<p>“My uncle, my cousin, and that awesome boyfriend, Leviathan, twenty-eleven. My&mdash; another family member, you could say she got herself. Or you could say the team dynamics, all that stuff I was talking about before, they played a role. I wasn’t paying enough attention, I let things pass by without remark when I should have pressed, pressed when I should have held back. And now she’s&mdash; she’s not family. My mom, recently, just…”</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to be a downer,” I said. “I’m really not. I do want to emphasize this isn’t a game. There’s a chance at greatness and there’s a chance, maybe a higher chance, of disaster. I experienced both.”</p>
<p>“Not to belittle that, but each and every one of us has gone through shit,” Tristan said. “If it’s supposed to be one part of good stuff for every ten parts bad, then I think most of us are owed some good stuff.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s supposed to be that way,” I said. “Ashley asked who I am. I’m a cape, born, raised, and learned. I’m a <em>student</em> of capes, I obsessed over them well before I had powers and I stepped up my game in a professional capacity after I got powers. I had date nights with my cape boyfriend where I studied and read his Wards handbook, because that’s how into it I was. I’ve followed the trajectories of two hundred cape careers and I’ve been part of a team trying to get off the ground. I looked seriously into what it would take to start a team back when my boyfriend was getting close to leaving the Wards, because I was worried he’d get moved to another city.”</p>
<p>I looked Ashley in the eyes. “This is me. I know cape stuff. I know what goes into it and I know what comes from it.”</p>
<p>I looked at Tristan. “The last thing it is, is fair. You’re not owed anything. If you roll the dice nine times and get bad results every time, you don’t have a better shot on the tenth roll because of that.”</p>
<p>“<em>But</em>,” Tristan said, and he said it with a bit of theatrical emphasis and a light in his eyes that made me really believe he had that experience in being in front of cameras and showing off for crowds. He was more into things as he continued, “You have a better shot at getting an optimal result if you roll the dice a lot, than you would if you rolled it a couple of times, get bad results, and quit. You have to get back up after you get knocked down. You <em>have</em> to.”</p>
<p>“Or stand up in the first place,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Or stand up in the first place, yeah,” Tristan said. He glanced at Mrs. Yamada, then back to me. “What you were talking about earlier, with Sveta and it being toxic to not stretch yourself out enough, it applies here.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to interrupt,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Tristan, can I ask why you keep looking to me? It’s not a usual habit.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Tristan said. “I barely noticed. I think I’m pretty used to you jumping in to tell me to back down or not get so into an argument.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“I guess the fact that I’m checking means I’m already aware I’m doing it again, and I should self-moderate. Back down on my own instead of being told to.”</p>
<p>“Look at that, Pavlov’s dog can ring his own bell now,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m all about the goats, thank you very much,” Tristan said. He touched a more pronounced lock of his magenta hair. “See, like the curling horns of a ram, right?”</p>
<p>Chris rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>Team Reach and goats? “You’re Capricorn?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I am,” Tristan said. “Bonus point for you.”</p>
<p>Kenzie, though, piped up with,“I like the hair-horns thing, Tristan. I never got it before now but I think it’s neat.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kenzie,” Tristan said. “This is part of why you’re awesome.”</p>
<p>Kenzie’s expression didn’t change much, but she had one leg crossed over the other, and the free-dangling foot bounced. Like a dog wagging its tail.</p>
<p>Chris said, “Getting an ‘I like it’ from Kenzie is like getting a participation medal from a school event. Everyone gets one.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make it worthless,” Kenzie said. She flashed a smile at Chris. “I never lie, I’m always honest when I say I like something. What makes me different is that I say it instead of keeping it to myself, because I think the world needs more positivity.”</p>
<p>“I like it,” Rain said. “I could never do it, because it takes a weird sort of social courage, but I like it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I think you lose this round, Chris,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“How do I lose? I wasn’t playing.”</p>
<p>“And,” Tristan said. Again, that one word, almost a pronouncement, volume and emphasis shifted just a bit to get attention. “On the topic of rounds and games, I feel like Mrs. Yamada is up to something, so I’m going to play this on a meta level and I’m going to shut myself up. I recognize I’ve been trying to win this conversation with Victoria and I’ve been monopolizing things by jumping in every time there’s an opportunity. I’m supposed to be listening more and trying to ‘win’ social interactions less, so I’m going to shut myself up. The others should chime in, I trust them to say what needs to be said.”</p>
<p>“I’m proud of you, Tristan,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>Tristan nodded.</p>
<p>Rain said, “I’m less proud and more amazed by the fact that your thought process went from ‘I need to try to win social interactions less’ to ‘this is a meta-scenario I can win’ in, what, twenty words?”</p>
<p>“What, did I?”</p>
<p>“And the fact he used so many words to say he was going to shut up,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Tristan frowned at Chris. “You guys are harsh.”</p>
<p>“It’s what we’re here for, isn’t it?” Sveta asked. “We moderate each other. Hopefully while not being <em>too</em> harsh on each other.”</p>
<p>“It’s part of it,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I think the ‘participation award’ comment was a little much, Chris. You have a tendency, which has been remarked on by others in the past, to think a clever put-down is a good thing because it’s clever, when most people will take away the fact it was a put-down.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Chris said. “I didn’t think it was a good or bad thing. Sorry Kenzie.”</p>
<p>He didn’t sound very sorry, but Kenzie’s dangling foot wiggled, and she nodded, wiggling slightly in her seat a bit between the motions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada said, “The reason I’ve been somewhat quiet, despite my referee role, is more or less what Tristan intuited. I’ve done this in the past &mdash; taking more of a backseat, giving you all more of an opportunity to respond to one another and push back against one another rather than relying on me to keep things under control. In the early stages, I had to step in rather quickly. I’m glad that with minimal prompting, Tristan stopped himself before reaching the point where I had to tell him to stop.”</p>
<p>“We’re being toyed with,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Not that,” Mrs. Yamada said. “The end goal is to get you all ready for the real world. Early on, the rudder needed a firm hand; as time goes on, I’m periodically hands off, seeing how you interact, until I see that you’re faring reasonably well on your own. It’s a gradual process that requires I give you more and more trust. Okay?”</p>
<p>Ashley nodded.</p>
<p>“It might be worth pausing to take stock in this moment. Snapshot the feelings and thoughts you’re experiencing. Some of you haven’t spoken up much at all. Depending on how you view the conversation, your participation or nonparticipation, some of you might be feeling frustrated, offended, worried, or even guilty.”</p>
<p>“Is that last one aimed at me?” Tristan asked. “Oh, wait, sorry, I’m supposed to have shut up.”</p>
<p>“It’s not aimed at you, Tristan,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I want each of you to think about where you stand right now. What are your feelings and where is your focus? Have you felt like you’ve had a voice or that you’ve taken things in a positive direction? Outside of the classroom, in a stressful situation with high stakes, these feelings could be magnified manifold. As Victoria suggested when she was talking about the slow progression of background negativity, the bad feelings aren’t always resolved or solved, and it would be very easy for a sliver of frustration to carry forward, nettling at you or being joined by other, similar feelings, until you felt compelled to do or say something you regret.”</p>
<p>“Handing that irritation off to someone else,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Mrs. Yamada said. “And, as a final comment on the topic from me, I brought Victoria here for several reasons. One of them is that I do believe she knows what she’s talking about. Another is that, from my position as a person with a measure of trust and power, with a strong feeling about what you’re committed to doing, it’s very difficult for me to both argue the points and also manage the discussion at the same time. If I tell Tristan to give others a chance to speak, it could be seen as me trying to shut down his side of the argument.”</p>
<p>“I’m here as a bit of a surrogate,” I said. “I’m here saying what you can’t.”</p>
<p>“In part. I think we do disagree on some things.”</p>
<p>“Like the value and importance we place in cape names, to quote a recent example,” I said. “I like them, you don’t.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I did, for the record, let Victoria know I would be sitting back more than usual.”</p>
<p>“You did. I didn’t expect to be ganged up on, though.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“It was mild,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to gang up on Victoria. I’ve done a lot of talking too,” Sveta said. “But I think that’s because I know Victoria, even if this is our first time really talking properly. There’s a bit of trust.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yep.”</p>
<p>“For what it’s worth,” Sveta said, “that trust means that much like Mrs. Yamada I do believe Victoria when she says she’s worried or she thinks this could go badly. I know she knows stuff. But I do want this. I want to stand on my own two feet. Sorry. I think the ones who’ve been quiet up until now should say stuff. Ashley, Chris, Kenzie, Rain. Or, you know, maybe Victoria has more to say.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, by the way, Victoria,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” I said. “I do want this to be a chance to share what I know and for you guys to gain, if that’s possible. Maybe there are places where you might realize there are gaps in your knowledge that you could then take time to brush up on. There isn’t a rush.”</p>
<p>“There is, kind of,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Heads turned.</p>
<p>“I talked about this last session. There’s currently some people after me. I want to be part of a team because it’s backup. Having a squad of people with me when I’m out and about would throw a wrench into their plans. It could give me a fighting chance when I wouldn’t have one otherwise.”</p>
<p>“People are after you?” I asked.</p>
<p>Rain held up his fingers in a way that made a rectangle. “It’s complicated.”</p>
<p>The rectangle was supposed to represent the card.</p>
<p>I smiled despite myself. “And these guys are okay with taking the risk involved there?”</p>
<p>“I’m not scared,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I’m breaking my vow of silence again,” Tristan said, “But I think I’m doing it for the right reasons here. I like, respect, and/or trust each of these guys who would be my teammates. But in particular, I consider Rain a friend. I’m already willing to throw my helmet into the ring and do what it takes to help save his life. We’ve got some similar garbage going on with… people we can’t get away from, and he’s had my back in the past when it came to my issue.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Rain said. He gestured vaguely toward his head.</p>
<p>“People?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Speaking for myself, I’m part of a multitrigger cluster,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Oh,” I said. I paused, taking stock of that. “I can see where that warrants playing the ‘complicated’ card.”</p>
<p>Kenzie spoke up, “Before you got in, Ashley, Victoria was saying we should all get a card saying ‘it’s complicated’ on the one side, and ‘handle with care’ on the other. I wanted to make sure you got what they were talking about.”</p>
<p>“I like that,” Ashley said. “It could use rewording. ‘Do not fuck with’, instead of handling with care.”</p>
<p>“Reminds me of the old wiki entries,” Capricorn said, “The red warning boxes for the scary capes.”</p>
<p>“Did I have one?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“You did,” I said.</p>
<p>Ashley nodded. “Good.”</p>
<p>Was it? I decided to leave it alone.</p>
<p>“You were motioning toward your head before,” I said, to Rain. “Are you referring to bleed-over, kiss and kill? That sort of thing?”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Rain said. “You weren’t lying when you were saying you’d studied up.”</p>
<p>I’d pulled my hand away from Sveta’s at one point, and I only realized it because she reached out and took my hand again, placing her hand over mine and giving it a congratulatory squeeze.</p>
<p>“Is it part of it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, honest to God,” Rain said. “When I’m vague and I’m saying it’s complicated, it’s really because I can’t give a one hundred percent clear answer. I’m still figuring out the rules this works by. I’ve wondered about the bleeding through. My personality changed after, but I don’t know how much of that is them and how much is how a trigger event is a wake-up call.”</p>
<p>“We like to give things hard labels, but sometimes they’re blurry around the edges,” I said.</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“If your own cluster is coming after you, I’d say you could chalk it up to kiss and kill. Again, blurry, might as well throw it in that bucket.”</p>
<p>“I won’t object,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“And while I’m on that subject, I’d feel compelled to stress that the term uses the word ‘kill’ for a reason.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“People die. Friends of people die. I’m still figuring out what you guys are doing, but… you want to bring kids into that?” I asked. I looked over to my right, at Kenzie and Chris.</p>
<p>“Definitely not,” Rain said. “Tristan is saying he’d help, Ashley is offering a hand, and Sveta might do what she can? That’s a hell of a lot better, compared to the same circumstance with me alone.”</p>
<p>“There’s more peace of mind in talking to legitimate authorities,” I said.</p>
<p>“There is,” Rain said. “If things get bad, I’ll go to them. I’ve tested the waters and asked questions. It doesn’t seem like they’ll offer help against a nebulous threat with an unclear window of time where it might occur, and villains I don’t know the names, locations or details of. It’s more like they want me to call them when I’ve got a claw at my throat.”</p>
<p>“Everyone’s busy,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Claw?” I asked. “Tinker claw?”</p>
<p>That got the room’s attention.</p>
<p>“You’re thinking of the man with the tinker arms you ran into at the community center, Victoria?” Mrs. Yamada asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>She explained, “Victoria mentioned that she took him for a multi-trigger, given the powers he displayed and the common links to a woman with claws she’d read about. I was going to bring it up at the end of the session, to avoid the lengthy digression like we had last session, and I hoped to extend it to a discussion in another venue, possibly with less people.”</p>
<p>“I derailed us early, it seems,” I said.</p>
<p>“You ran into a member of my cluster?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Big guy, beard, heavy coat.”</p>
<p>“Long hair, hood, rough voice,” Rain said, “And a glare, like if looks could kill.”</p>
<p>“No hood, glare… I don’t know. He wore a mask with a built in glare, but he seemed like the scowly type. Definitely on the voice.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Rain said. “When did you fight him?”</p>
<p>“When?” I asked. “Um. Thirteen days ago. First Monday of September. High school had just started.”</p>
<p>Rain held up one hand, counting on his fingers, his lips moving.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Timing matters.” It was Tristan who had replied, while Rain was busy counting.</p>
<p>“He was strong then,” Rain said, finishing his counting and dropping his hands.</p>
<p>“He was a bit of a bastard, if I’m being honest,” I said. “Not fun to go up against. He’s one of the ones who was after you?”</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“Why the counting?”</p>
<p>“It’s complicated,” Rain said. He must have seen the look on my face, because he added, “The powers wax, wane, and shuffle around. I try to keep track. He was loaded to bear on that day, if I’m remembering right. The only power he didn’t have a lot of was mine, and maybe a little bit less of his own.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. “Which is yours?”</p>
<p>“Uh. Mine is a blaster power,” Rain said. “It’s pretty mediocre. I shoot things or people and they’re vulnerable to being broken for a short while after. To put it simply.”</p>
<p>“Mediocre is sort of the name of the game when it comes to clusters,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a tinker power, I make extra arms and hands. They’re not very good. Barely above what I’d be able to make on my own, fragile enough that if you grab something wrong they can break, no strength, ugly. The prosthetic focus is part of why I was introduced to the group, I think.”</p>
<p>“It was,” Mrs. Yamada said. “We thought there was a chance of insights across designs.”</p>
<p>Sveta would be one, obviously. Ashley raised a hand, slender, with black-painted nails.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell that her hand was prosthetic.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t much help, because I’m a really bad tinker,” Rain said. “I can also catch my balance or secure my footing more easily, that’s my version of the big guy’s mover power. It’s handy in a way, lets me turn on a dime or keep from falling over.”</p>
<p>“Wait, his power was the mover power? The arms and emotion power were his <em>secondaries?</em>” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying,” Rain said. “I think he had a bit less of his own power that day, with the way it was sorted. My last power is an emotion power. Guilt and doubt, over an area. It’s pretty tepid.”</p>
<p>“He hit me with it a few times,” Tristan said. “Tepid is a good word for it. You can actually not notice you’re being hit by it.”</p>
<p>“And it waxes and wanes, you said?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My blaster power can get a bump some days. My others, no. They stay at about that power level. The others change it up more, they’ll act on days they’re strong.”</p>
<p>“We may be getting distracted,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I might suggest you carry on this discussion later. Victoria can fill you in on…”</p>
<p>“Snag,” I said. “Sorry. This is actually really interesting though. I’d be happy to talk it over another time.”</p>
<p>“It’s good to have a name for him,” Rain said. “Uh, okay. Getting back on topic, I know I’m a little selfish in why I’m doing this. Wanting people to have my back.”</p>
<p>“We all need people to have our backs,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. “It’s still selfish. It’s messy and I’m not sure I can pull my own weight with all of this. I do want to help people though. I’ve been selfish for a long time. I’m trying to be better. I know I’m contradicting myself in what I’m doing here, but it makes sense to me, and so few things do.”</p>
<p>“You said&mdash;” Kenzie started. “Oh, are you done, Rain?”</p>
<p>“I’m done. Pretty much where I’m at. I’ll buy you a coffee or whatever you drink, Victoria, if you’ll tell me about Snag.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“You said you had info about hero teams, Victoria,” Kenzie said. “And I’m interested in that because I do want to try to be a hero first.”</p>
<p>“First?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m saying I’ll try, maybe a few times, and if it doesn’t work out I’ll try other things but if it doesn’t work out then I might try being a mercenary, or a villain.”</p>
<p>“You would be terrifying as shit if you were a villain,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Would I? Is that a compliment?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“No,” Chris said. “It’s a neutral fact, and I don’t use the word terrifying lightly.”</p>
<p>“Be fair, Chris,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“I’m being fair. This is an objective fact,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“And be gentle, too. If you <em>must</em> levy a criticism&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Fact.”</p>
<p>“&mdash;there are nicer ways to say it.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Kenzie stuck out her tongue at him.</p>
<p>“Terrifying is good,” Ashley said. “Terrifying slows the other guy down. It makes them make mistakes.”</p>
<p>“You’re not <em>wrong</em>,” I said. “I’ve used that to my advantage&mdash;”</p>
<p>“And it’s fun,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Ah… I used to think that,” I said. “I’ve come to reconsider that sentiment. I regret how I employed it, a little, and I regret enjoying it a lot.”</p>
<p>Ashley sighed a little.</p>
<p>“We’ve talked about this at some length,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Here in the group. The approaches that work. Fear comes at a cost.”</p>
<p>“It does,” I said. “Not necessarily in the ways you’d expect, pushing people away or any of that. It makes a <em>mess</em>. It makes people unpredictable. I have an awe-fear aura so I’ve seen this at work.”</p>
<p>“I almost envy you,” Ashley said. “To have something you can so casually employ.”</p>
<p>“It’s not casual,” I said. “Because like I said, it’s complicated in terms of the mess it makes of things. I’ve been trying to be more deliberate about how I use it.”</p>
<p>“See, this excites me,” Kenzie said. “I want to learn from Ashley because I saw the camcorder footage from the Boston Games&mdash; I showed you that one right, Ashley?”</p>
<p>“You did,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I’ll get you a copy because you liked it so much. There’s also a video I don’t think I’ve shown you but it’s mostly you walking through a club with someone and everyone gets out of your way. That was interesting.”</p>
<p>“Do you want people to get out of your way, Kenzie?” Sveta asked. “I don’t think it’s good or fun.”</p>
<p>“Definitely no. It’s still interesting. But, um, I also want to learn from Victoria because I do want to be on a team, I want to be on <em>this</em> team of course, but whatever happens I want to be on <em>some</em> team. Then I want to be useful so I stay there. The more I know the more useful I can be.”</p>
<p>“I am interested in hearing it too,” Sveta said. “About teams, making heroics work.”</p>
<p>“I looked over my schoolwork and some old projects before I came today,” I said. “I typed up some bullet points and thought hard about what I wanted to say, and… being here, I’m not sure it’s valid.”</p>
<p>“It’s valid. I want to hear it,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I would too,” Ashley said. “It’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>I was caught a little off guard by that.</p>
<p>I could remember Ashley’s comments when the topic of the cards had come up. She’d liked the ‘handle with care’ aspect of it, which was illuminating in its own way. More specifically, she’d liked it while interpreting it as a ‘do not fuck with’ license.</p>
<p>The way it had been framed and what I knew of Ashley and Damsel of Distress made me imagine it as a ‘warning: volatile’ label on her breast, worn much like a nametag.</p>
<p>She’d reacted to me belittling her even in a small way, earlier, when I’d reduced her to a pin on a map.</p>
<p>“It might be worth saying why you think it isn’t valid,” Mrs. Yamada suggested.</p>
<p>I tried to find the words to articulate what I wanted to say without getting on anyone’s bad side, my fingers twirling a lock of hair while I looked down at the floor. I looked up and looked her in the eyes, then looked at everyone else as I said, “I can come here and I can say, alright, finances. Being a hero team is tough financially. I touched on this before. How do you get funding, one source, many, or is it institutional? What’s your budget, what can you expect to pay, where are the hidden costs, like medical or needing a headquarters, and what are the potential costs or risks if you decide to save money by trimming the budget somewhere? And maybe that angle works for some of you.”</p>
<p>“It feels abstract,” Sveta said. “I have a stipend, I pay rent, I have to budget, but when you talk about things in the big picture like that, I find it hard to imagine.”</p>
<p>“Budgets and money make more sense when you root them in tangible things that are relevant to you. If you had questions about one area, I might have more to say about it, or I could expand on the idea, <em>if</em> that was a thing that worked for you guys, as a way to wrap your head around what you’re trying to do. I could do the same for objectives and goals, information gathering, costumes and presentation, allegiances and direction, liaisons, territories, methodology… one or two others I’m not remembering off the top of my head. But as far as I can tell, you’re approaching this from several different directions, with very different priorities.”</p>
<p>“We definitely are,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I don’t get the impression Ashley is prioritizing developing herself as a person, becoming independent, or catching up in life, like Sveta is. I don’t get the impression its about becoming less selfish or wanting or needing backup, like Rain. I’m not sure what someone of your pedigree would be doing here, Ashley.”</p>
<p>“Pedigree?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“It means aristocratic background when used to describe humans,” Chris said. “She’s not calling you a bred animal. I’m pretty sure.”</p>
<p>“I’m not bothered. I like the word choice,” Ashley said. She had half of a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“It was picked to be liked,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m here to learn, Victoria,” Ashley said. Her gaze with the narrow pupils and lack of irises was intense.</p>
<p>“That’s positive,” I said.</p>
<p>“No it’s not,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m here to learn how heroes operate, so I can be more effective against them when I return to being a villain,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>I looked at Sveta and Tristan, then at Mrs. Yamada.</p>
<p>“She’s not lying,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“It’s positive, really,” Sveta said. “She’s agreed to stick with us until we crash and burn.”</p>
<p>“Until you fail,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“<em>Until we crash and burn</em>,” Sveta said. “We went over this. If you leave at the first sign of failure then you’ll be gone in the first week and you won’t have learned anything, and everyone loses.”</p>
<p>“Irritating,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Reality is irritating,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“We’re low-key confident we can get her to stick around on the side of the good guys, with sufficient friendship, ass-kicking of our opponents, and time to convince her of the upsides,” Tristan said, to me.</p>
<p>“You vastly underestimate how much I enjoy being a villain, Tristan.”</p>
<p>“You enjoy being a villain but you don’t like the life that comes with it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It had its merits,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Rain said. “And a lot of other misery besides that.”</p>
<p>Ashley sighed. “I’ve already agreed. I’ll join you. I’ll defend you from your cluster. In exchange I learn about heroes, I get information about the cape scene, and I may get training. If it fails, I’ll go back to what I know and enjoy. You’ll have your chance to convince me that being a hero is great. I doubt you’ll succeed. Most heroes I’ve met have been imbeciles and nuisances.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. I put a hand to my forehead, closing my eyes. Capes were so damn weird sometimes.</p>
<p>“You said it was better than the alternative, before everyone arrived,” Kenzie said. “Being a hero.”</p>
<p>“I did,” I said. <em>I might be regretting saying that now</em>. The fact that Kenzie paid attention to what I’d said and was quick enough to bring out the salient points was good, objectively, but it was kind of a pain here. I could see where some of Mrs. Yamada’s worries were rooted, here. “You have a strong drive to learn, then, Ashley?”</p>
<p>“What I want hasn’t changed. I want to be on top. I want to destroy my enemies and give potential enemies a reason to fear me. I’m going to do it right this time.”</p>
<p>This time. There were four different things I wanted to reply to there, and I settled on the easy one. “Reports were that you died.”</p>
<p>“I did,” she said. “Now I’m back. My power isn’t holding me back anymore.”</p>
<p>“You get sparky sometimes,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“So long as my hands are maintained, I’m fine. I have contacts. I’m eating well, I’m sleeping, I’m studying and I’m training. I’ll do it right this time. I won’t die this time.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. “That pretty much sums up what I’m trying to say here. You guys have your reasons. I can’t show you a spreadsheet or make a list that meets your needs because your needs are diverse. It’s not about hard stats like dollars and viewership.”</p>
<p>“It’s about dollars for me,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Right. I’ll note you do have a very different idea than I do about how much money there may be,” I said.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Tristan said. “I don’t know if it’s that different.”</p>
<p>The thing I wanted to say that I couldn’t without offending people was that a lot of them were coming at things from an irrational or emotional perspective, from their self, and not from logic. To challenge Sveta’s approach on this was to challenge the woman she wanted to be. Challenging Rain meant putting his mortality at risk. Damsel was too volatile to push too hard, she had her motivations, and I couldn’t imagine scaring her off would do any good to anyone. The team would go forward without her, dejected and possibly upset with me or with Mrs. Yamada for inviting me.</p>
<p>My impression was that Tristan was looking at the money from an abstract, emotional perspective as well.</p>
<p>“I barely have a high school education, it’s not like there’s a lot out there for me, and money is tight everywhere,” Tristan said. “I like the hero stuff. I like the notoriety, and I like being out there. We need a fix, and the two ways I see of us getting one would be if we get the money together to pay the right cape, or we chance into meeting the right cape.”</p>
<p>“Fix?” I asked. “Sorry, I missed something.”</p>
<p>“With how quick you were about cape terms and names, and how you knew Reach, I thought you might have realized.”</p>
<p>“I figured out you’re Capricorn.”</p>
<p>“More to it than that. You know how two brothers can get in a pissy fight over who gets to have the remote and decide what to watch on TV? We’re stuck doing that, except it’s way more fucking intense.”</p>
<p>Two brothers and one power? Or&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh, I was an idiot.</p>
<p>“That we are,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>We. “You’re a case seventy?”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you how bummed I am that it isn’t case sixty-nine instead, but no, that number went to a bigfoot sighting or something stupid. A stupid bit of immature humor would’ve been the one good thing in this mess of a thing.”</p>
<p>“Case seventies in North America included Knot, Tandem, Zigzag was one, I think, there was House of Three in Quebec. And… you, it seems.”</p>
<p>“One or two of them might not be seventies, but they get called seventies because they’re close enough. Blurred lines, like you said. When twins trigger, the powers are identical or nearly identical. When twins trigger and they’re touching one another, like you said to Rain, things get blurry, the agent is too stupid or careless to tell where one starts and the other ends, or it wants to fuck with us, and it jams everything in together. Two minds, two similar powers, and one body to be shared.”</p>
<p>“Is he asleep?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No. He’s in here, he’s watching and listening. He sleeps when I sleep, or I sleep when he sleeps, if he’s in the driver’s seat. We trade out for two hour shifts.”</p>
<p>“Can he communicate?” I asked. “Talk to you while it’s your turn?”</p>
<p>“That would be too easy,” Tristan said. His good humor was gone now. He just looked sad. “No.”</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Two brothers, and only one of them could be interacting with the world at a time. For the other, it was&mdash; picturing it made me think of being in the hospital again. Being stuck, immobile, locked in while the world went on around them.</p>
<p>Oppressive, that kind of thinking. Just as oppressive to be living it.</p>
<p>“I like Byron,” Kenzie said. “I really wish he would stay for the therapy sessions.”</p>
<p>“I like him too,” Rain said. He leaned back in his chair, hands at his hair, pushing it away from his face as he stretched. “I don’t like talking about you like you’re not here, Byron. We’ll hang out later, okay? Unwind.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long and rocky road,” Tristan said, to me. “He’s not interested in the hero thing either. He’s on Mrs. Yamada’s side here. On yours, kind of, Victoria.”</p>
<p>On my side? I was trying to frame my argument, but it was an uphill battle for logic to win against the heart, and it did seem like their hearts were in this, to varying degrees.</p>
<p>I decided to say as much.</p>
<p>“I might not be winning any points with Mrs. Yamada in this,” I said. “And I don’t know enough about your individual situations, but you have personal, thought out reasons for wanting to do this. At this stage, I’m not telling you guys you shouldn’t do this. I’m definitely, definitely not saying you <em>should</em>. I think there are a few things to work out. I’m honestly really concerned about Ashley.”</p>
<p>“As anyone should be,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“That would be why I’m concerned. I don’t know if you guys want to sit down as a group at a cafe or something, hammer out some basic plans. You’d probably want something like an outline or playbook that you can take with you when you’re talking to the Wardens or whoever’s managing the territory closest to you. I think the hero teams are covering different sections of the city, and you wouldn’t want to step on jurisdictional toes. <em>If</em> you want to do this.”</p>
<p>“That could be great,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Kenzie nodded, very enthusiastically, as in most things.</p>
<p>“Chris and Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said. “You’ve been quiet.”</p>
<p>“I’ve talked about wanting to pick Victoria’s brain and she listed some topics,” Kenzie said. “I like this whole conversation as a recap, seeing where everyone’s at, instead of trying to think back to previous sessions and think about what people’s reasons are. I’m glad we’re talking like this and I want to have that meeting and figure things out.”</p>
<p>“Chris?” Mrs. Yamada prodded.</p>
<p>“Can I just say I don’t want to share with the guest here?”</p>
<p>“You can,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Is it the truth?”</p>
<p>Chris looked annoyed as he looked at her. “I don’t like talking about stuff. Digging into my thoughts for answers stresses me out and throws me <em>more</em> out of whack than it helps.”</p>
<p>“You can’t exist purely on the surface level,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“I <em>can.</em> It might or might not be good for me, but something that could be good or could be bad is a lot better than no-win after no-win.”</p>
<p>“No win?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I could say it’s none of your business,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“You could,” I said. “It’s your right.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why you’re as defensive as you are,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’m playing defense because paranoia is the only way to survive,” Chris said. He reached up to adjust his headphones, wincing mid-adjustment. “How many sessions did it take before I gave you all the basics?”</p>
<p>“Four or five,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Well, this is session one with the new person,” Chris said. “If you want to drop me from the team because I’m not okay with that, fine. I’ll figure something else out.”</p>
<p>“Nobody is saying that,” Sveta said. “You’ve come this far with us, don’t get shy now.”</p>
<p>“I’m not shy, I’m <em>suspicious</em>. That won’t change,” Chris said. He sounded irritated, in a way his expression didn’t convey effectively.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I don’t think pressuring Chris will help anything. Again, however, I would really urge everyone present to periodically take stock. Pay attention to what you’re feeling, imagine this dialogue extrapolated out to a greater, higher-stakes situation. How will you handle your feelings, and will you feel have both a voice and the ability to affect the changes you need?”</p>
<p>“You’re worried we’ll get railroaded,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about a number of things, Rain. I wish you would be willing to put things off for six months or a year, maintain contact, see how you get along as simple friends and acquaintances, let the ties solidify or break as they will, and then move forward if it is what you still want.”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of issues to hammer out,” I said. “You’re coming at this from so many different directions… how do you even get started in terms of the kind of team you end up being? In other things? I’d join my voice to Mrs. Yamada’s and urge you to take your time.”</p>
<p>“Like I said, I’m feeling the pressure,” Rain said. “My cluster is homing in on me.”</p>
<p>“I can talk to people, if you want. If you need another cape to back you up, I might be able to help.”</p>
<p>“I mean, that sounds nice,” Rain said. “But I can’t help but lie in bed some mornings, wondering if this is the day. If, in the next twenty-four hours, the other three members of my cluster come after me in an organized way, with a lot of money and a lot of resources poured into things. When I see it playing out in my head, I know they’re organized, and I worry we’re not. If we’re part of a team, if we’re training, coordinating, then maybe we can work together in an organized way too.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that goes into making a team. You can stay together and watch Rain’s back, meet, talk, and plan.”</p>
<p>“Without getting the practice in?” Tristan asked. “Sorry to butt in again, but it takes time to learn how to work with teammates. Some more than others.”</p>
<p>“What you’re wanting to do on the heroism front is hard enough without added complications. It’s a bad, bad climate for heroes to try to get started. That could end up being more distraction than the training is a boon.”</p>
<p>“Imagine how bad the climate would be if nobody new got started,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I won’t deny that. I just&mdash; I have serious reservations, but I also recognize I probably won’t be changing any minds. Instead of trying to get you to reverse course or stop, I’m saying maybe change trajectories a bit. Go slow, focus on what needs to be focused on, instead of getting distracted with the many, <em>many</em> side things that go into getting a proper team started.”</p>
<p>“Focusing on keeping Rain safe, as the priority thing?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I can meet you guys at a coffee shop or somewhere, we can make it a regular thing. I can back you up, I might be able to introduce you to people, and we do what Mrs. Yamada suggested, and take months or a year to get a <em>really</em> good game plan put together.”</p>
<p>“You’re committing to a lot, Victoria,” Mrs. Yamada said. “It won’t conflict with your other plans?”</p>
<p>“I like doing this sort of thing. I’ll find a way to work it in. It gives me an opportunity to stay in touch with Sveta, too.”</p>
<p>I was elbowed, hard, from my left.</p>
<p>“If you think I’m letting you drift away or lose touch now then you need a reality check,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t planning on it, don’t worry,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>It was an abrupt statement, cutting into the dialogue, the serious tone different from the easy back-and-forth.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t be leaving you out,” Sveta said. “You said you were interested in what Victoria knew about heroes, and you’d be part of the team when we got started.”</p>
<p>“No I wouldn’t,” Kenzie said. “Because you all would be doing what you have to do to help Rain, and I’d be on the sidelines. You said you don’t want to have a kid there in a dangerous situation, so I wouldn’t actually be there when things went down. And if you thought there would be an attack soon you wouldn’t want me hanging around in case I got caught up in it, so you’d all meet and I’d stay home then, too.”</p>
<p>“It could be over in a couple of weeks,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It could <em>not</em> be over, too,” Kenzie said. She smiled. “Come on. I’ve done this before. Again and again. I did it during the leadership camps and the exercises in San Diego. I did it during the branding in LA and I kind of did it with the Baltimore Wards.”</p>
<p>“Did what?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Got left behind. Or sidelined and ignored. The reasons were good, or maybe I’m a stupid, gullible idiot and the reasons are bad, and I believed them anyway.”</p>
<p>“I liked your contributions to the group, I’d <em>want</em> you to stick around,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know you mean well, Victoria, but this is the way it always goes,” Kenzie said. She shrugged. “The compliments, the softening of the blow. I think you’re nice and you’re trying to do the right thing. But again and again, because I’m a kid, or because I’m small and weak, or because I’m a girl, or because I’m black, or because I have school, or because I’m vulnerable, or I’m annoying, or because they want to be careful around me because I have <em>problems,</em> or because I’ve said the wrong things because I’m an idiot a lot of the time, or because&mdash; because <em>whatever</em> the reason, good or bad, hateful or kind…”</p>
<p>She trailed off there. She was staring down at the ground, head down where I couldn’t see it. She huffed out out a small laugh.</p>
<p>Her hands were on either side of her hips, gripping the sides of the plastic chair.</p>
<p>“Articulate what you want, Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Assertive. Not passive, not passive-aggressive.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be left behind,” Kenzie said. She was speaking more slowly, deliberately. A dramatic change of pace from her usual output. “I’m experienced in this, so when I say I think I see things going this way, it would be nice if people believed me.”</p>
<p>“More assertive, Kenzie,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“Trust me,” Kenzie said, with emphasis. She looked up, flashed a smile at me, then shrugged. “You say you’re experienced in cape stuff and I think it shows and that’s amazing. I’m experienced in this and I’m really tired of this song and dance.”</p>
<p>“I understand,” I said. “I’m sorry to have touched on something that sensitive. I should have been more considerate.”</p>
<p>“It’s not you,” she said. “It’s me. It’s a regular thing. I don’t blame you. It’s the way I am, it makes people act this way around me. And&mdash;”</p>
<p>She drew in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“&mdash;And I would like to be included from the beginning, in a way where I’m useful and participating and I’m not watching from the sidelines. I would like to do the team thing from the beginning. I don’t mind if it’s small or slow but I want to do <em>something</em> with progress.<em></em> Or if not that, then tell me upfront so I can have my feelings hurt now right away instead of over a long time.”</p>
<p>“This is really important to you,” I said.</p>
<p>“There have only ever been three times in my life where people acted like they wanted me around. Not counting the adults who get paid to look after me, sorry Mrs. Yamada. The first one, it led to my trigger, so you can imagine how well that went. The second one was the couple of months I spent with the Baltimore Wards, and they don’t want anything to do with me anymore. The third is here. These guys.”</p>
<p>“Well gee whiz, Kenzie,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>She smiled, “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“I like to win my arguments, but you can’t bring that kind of weaponry to bear. It’s just not fair on those guys.”</p>
<p>Kenzie smiled again.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like us,” Sveta said. “I do want to include you, and I hope this thing works out the way you want it to.”</p>
<p>“We’ll figure something out,” I said.</p>
<p>“We?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“I was going to say,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to step on your toes or insinuate myself into things,” I said. “But if you’ll have me, maybe I could take on a role as coach or something. If you really want to do this&mdash;”</p>
<p>I could see the looks on their faces. Yeah, they wanted to do this.</p>
<p>“&mdash;Then maybe we avoid having you guys go from a mediated discussion in a controlled environment like this to… something more loosely supervised and managed, for the mediation part of things, and we look for a shallower pool to dive into instead, where you can get started in some capacity sooner, we ensure everyone has something to do, but we keep it manageable and small.”</p>
<p>“You’re volunteering?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“If Mrs. Yamada is okay with this idea. I don’t see you guys changing your minds, so…”</p>
<p>“It would bring me some peace of mind,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“Mediated,” Rain said. “You’d be babysitting us?”</p>
<p>“Coaching, giving direction if it’s lacking, give you someone to turn to if you need someone to help resolve a dispute. I can’t promise you full time hours, it’d be a secondary or minor thing for me, but… I’m trying to think of a good way to tackle this and this is the best idea I’ve got.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kenzie said. “I want to hear more about the heroing stuff.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t object,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“And the shallow end?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“We’ll figure something out,” I said. “I’m thinking of a couple of possible places, we could put feelers out in one that’s close enough for everyone here to get to. A few of these places have small populations of B-listers, and I think it would be a good, easy place to learn the ropes.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap25">Flare &mdash; 2.7</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“I felt energized after,” I said.</p>
<p>“Can you elaborate on that?” Mrs. Yamada asked.</p>
<p>“My cousin remarked I looked better, more in touch with the world. Normally, I get these intrusive… non-thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Non-thoughts?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Like, not intrusive thoughts, not ideas that I can’t get out of my head, but my mind has these places it tries to go, and I reflexively shut them out. Like, one thing, I spent two years in the hospital and in the care home, obsessing,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re talking about,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. And I feel like I’ve devoted enough thought to that. Two years of time, more than a lifetime’s worth. So I lock up, mentally, or trip over the subject. I get that a lot as my mood gets worse. I have it for things I do, like using my powers. I had it a lot less after the day at the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Some people have physiological signs, feeling ill, headaches, breathing, when they’re trying to find an outlet for things they can’t otherwise express,” Mrs. Yamada said. “Others have habits, things or people they go back to, they could have needs or cravings.”</p>
<p>“What if the thing you turn to is also the thing that causes stress?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“That is absolutely a thing that happens, Kenzie. It’s at the root of downward spirals like addiction or overeating. On a more subtle level, something like a panic disorder can self-reinforce because the panic provides relief, even as it makes the actual situations worse. I like that Victoria identified something that arrests or controls the downward spiral.”</p>
<p>“It’s the sort of thing I plan to do again,” I said. “Putting all the other stuff aside, distilling things down to the most basic route of helping people, in a way that’s good and healthy for me, too. Or&mdash;”</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada had started speaking at the same time I added the ‘or’. We both stopped.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” she said.</p>
<p>“Or where there’s bad, the good is enough to outweigh that bad and leave me better off,” I said. I shrugged.</p>
<p>“Here in the group, we often discuss the issues we’re facing, how we relate to what others bring up, and we talk about solutions. I’ll periodically try to turn things to more positive topics, but with six people here, it’s common for people to come to the session with something they want to delve into.</p>
<p>“I like that you’re dwelling on the good things, Victoria, and that you’re giving me an excuse to turn things toward a better note as we wrap up. Does anyone else have something to share?”</p>
<p>Tristan raised one hand a little, and Mrs. Yamada nodded, giving him permission to say.</p>
<p>“It’s not positive,” he said. “I don’t know if that’s alright.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“What Victoria was saying, how she was saying she was happy, seeing the kids happy, and how she felt energized after. I don’t have that. I don’t have a way to recharge when I’m not at one hundred percent.”</p>
<p>“You definitely have things you’re passionate about,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I like people, parties, noise, really letting the walls drop away and having fun. There are things I’d want to go out and do which I can’t. Things I’m not comfortable talking about with Kenzie present.”</p>
<p>Kenzie smiled at him. “Rude stuff. I’m not <em>that</em> young.”</p>
<p>“I know you probably know, I’m still not comfortable talking about it like this,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You say Kenzie but you don’t even mention me,” Chris said. “I’m perversely pleased by that. You mean fucking, right?”</p>
<p>“Please, Chris,” Mrs. Yamada said.</p>
<p>“I mean <i>stuff</i>,” Tristan said, “Stuff I can’t do because of my situation. I did some of it back before the trigger. More like sophomore high schoolers stealing their parents booze and having way too many people in a house while the parents are away, but that was the <i>time of my life</i>. It was when I was the most excited to be on this&mdash; on that planet. Now I can’t do stuff like that, the pressure release valve is screwed up for the same reasons <i>I’m</i> screwed up.”</p>
<p>“The case seventy stuff,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. “Now me passing out drunk might mean I screw up the time window for passing back control, however many alarms I set, and I can’t do that to Byron. I can’t go have a one night stand because the way things are mean I’d be involving him in it as a bystander or voyeur.”</p>
<p>“Can you find new outlets?” Sveta asked. “One thing I’ve learned over the past little while is that I still had a lot of growing to do. It’s easy when you’re in a bad place to think ‘this is it, this is me,’ but there’s always more out there.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying,” Tristan said. “But it sucks to know that the stuff I want to do and the <i>people</i> I want to do are out there and I can’t do that. I know it’s the same for Byron. It’s different for him, though, because he’s a quiet guy, he wants to take it easy, but you get the weird conflict where you want to chill out but you can’t because you also want to maximize your use of time, when you only get to live half your life.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to talk about that at a later point, when we’re not a minute away from wrapping up,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I’d also like to have a word with Byron and you after the session, make sure everything’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“On a positive note, if nobody minds,” Sveta said, sitting up with the faintest of metal-on-metal sounds. “I got to recharge too, but it was a big one.”</p>
<p>“Your trip?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“I know we talked about it last week, but we mostly talked about Rain staying safe and the hero team thing. It wasn’t a little pick me up. It was big, and I really want to find the chances to go and do stuff like that again.”</p>
<p>“Traveling?” I asked. Her smile was contagious.</p>
<p>“Traveling. We had a boat, and when we weren’t around people, I got out of my hamster ball. We stayed pretty close to the coasts, Weld sailing or driving the boat and me swimming. It was really, really nice.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you got a lot of sun,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Sveta smiled. Her face was so pale that her complexion was borderline impossible for a human. “I like swimming. I want to find a way to get out and do it more. It’s the first time I can remember moving and having there be resistance. Everything else is too hard or too reflex.”</p>
<p>“Anyone else?” Mrs. Yamada asked. “Final words? Thoughts?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you had a good time,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I really did,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>There was a pause. No responses, the only sound was a clack as the wind blew the blinds away from the window and they swung back into position. I wondered how bad the rain was.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada looked up at the clock, then said, “Then we should wrap up. Tristan, a word. Everyone else, have a good week. There won’t be a Friday meeting this week, so I will see you next Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to exchange people’s contact information, if it’s okay,” I said. “If you’re wanting to do this.”</p>
<p>“You keep saying that like you’re hoping we won’t,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“It might make things simpler,” I said.</p>
<p>“The others have my number,” she said. “I don’t keep track of it.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>“Do you guys mind giving Victoria my number while you’re at it?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Can do,” Rain said.</p>
<p>People were standing, now. Tristan gave Sveta a hand in getting to her feet.</p>
<p>The group, Tristan excepted, filed out into the hallway. A few people had coats draped or hooked on the the stacked plastic chairs along the hallway’s length. I’d left my bag on the ground. I pulled my phone out before I slung it over one shoulder.</p>
<p>A message from Crystal, asking if I was coming home for dinner.</p>
<p>“Pass me your number?” Rain asked. His phone was as battered as he was, with a crack running down the case.</p>
<p>I thumbed through the concentric rings, put my thumb on my phone number and profile information, and then flicked it in Rain’s direction.</p>
<p>“Got it,” he said.</p>
<p>His info appeared on my phone, at the top edge. It was soon joined by Tristan’s, then Kenzie’s and Ashley’s, near simultaneously. Kenzie’s name was framed with colorful symbols. Chris’s and Sveta’s were the last to appear.</p>
<p>Rain had handled sending me Sveta’s, Ashley’s and Tristan’s, it seemed. Ashley was pulling on a raincoat, and Sveta’s hands were clasped in front of her.</p>
<p>Sveta might have sent me hers without using her hands, now that I thought about it. It was possible she had a phone in her suit.</p>
<p>I glanced back into the room, to see if Mrs. Yamada had anything she wanted to convey with a look or gesture. Instead, I saw her talking to someone who wasn’t Tristan.</p>
<p>Byron had black hair, shorter than Tristan’s, slicked back with something that shone in the room’s lights. He wore a jacket, a black v-neck shirt, and jeans. The contrast between him and Tristan in everything but facial features were striking&mdash; Tristan had been bright haired, his top and shorts all about contrasts with light and dark, color and lack thereof. He’d brimmed with confidence.</p>
<p>Byron didn’t. He looked distinctly uncomfortable, his hands in his jacket pockets, shoulders forward, a look of concern on his face. The muted gray-blue of his jacket, the black v-neck shirt, the jeans, there weren’t any of the intentional contrasts I’d seen in Tristan.</p>
<p>“Are we going to wait for Tristan and try to have a quick chat about things?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“I have dinner,” Kenzie said. She looked at me. “I try to have dinner with my parents every night. We’re trying to reinforce that normalcy.”</p>
<p>“Is that going alright?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“It’s going,” Kenzie said. She smiled. “Which is better than the alternative.”</p>
<p>“I’m all people’d out,” Chris said. “Most of you guys are better than some, but I’m done for now.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good enough reason to put it off, then,” Rain said. He gripped the doorframe, leaning into the room a little. I heard Mrs. Yamada’s voice stop.</p>
<p>“Yes?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Wanted to let Tristan and Byron know we’re heading out. We’re not meeting today.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Byron said. “He’ll have heard you.”</p>
<p>He sounded different, even. Quieter, in the way people talked if they were sure they’d be heard regardless, if they didn’t care, or, on the other side of things if they knew they wouldn’t be listened to.</p>
<p>“We’ll hang out,” Rain said. “You and me, we’ll do something soon.”</p>
<p>“Okay. How’s Erin?”</p>
<p>“She’s good,” Rain said. “I could invite her to come with.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, for sure,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Rain was still smiling when he stepped away from the door.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I had to pause as Kenzie and Chris got out of my way and turned to head down the hallway, while Rain and Ashley led the way. I didn’t catch Ashley and Rain’s brief exchange of words.</p>
<p>I glanced back at the room, and saw Byron was looking at me while he was saying something to Mrs. Yamada. The up-down look, followed by the quick glance away when he realized I’d seen him.</p>
<p><em>You’re too young for me and you’re not my type, based on what little I’ve seen and heard</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Sveta took my arm, squeezing it. My reminder to focus on the others.</p>
<p>“You’re <em>okay</em>,” Sveta said, squeezing harder for a moment. “You can talk.”</p>
<p>“You seem to be doing okay yourself,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>great</em>,” she said. “Today was a good day.”</p>
<p>We walked to catch up, and I could feel Sveta periodically leaning harder on me as she worked to maintain her stride. For all that she was in there, no doubt pulling on multiple components and relying on intricate machinery, she managed pretty darn well.</p>
<p>A little less so on the stairs to the ground floor, but I gave her my arm and plenty of support, and she did okay.</p>
<p>She hugged me with enthusiasm as we walked the five feet from the stairs to the side door, where the others were waiting under the rectangle of roof that jutted out from the side of the boxy building.</p>
<p>“I’m going,” Chris said. “Bye.”</p>
<p>“Bye,” Sveta said, amid a few other scattered responses. I raised one hand in a token wave.</p>
<p>Chris removed his headphones as he walked away, stowing them in one pocket of his cargo shorts. He didn’t use an umbrella or wear a raincoat. He seemed content to get rained on.</p>
<p>Kenzie had a blue raincoat with duffle coat toggles on the front, and was standing a bit in the rain, head bent over her phone. Ashley stood on the sidewalk, her hood up. Rain had settled for an umbrella, but hadn’t opened it yet.</p>
<p>“I’m walking to the bus station in Webster,” Rain said. “Normally Tristan, Sveta, and I walk that way.”</p>
<p>“I can head that way,” I said. “I’ll walk with you guys for a bit.”</p>
<p>“I’ll come,” Kenzie said, not looking up from her phone. “There’s still time before dinner.”</p>
<p>“You sure?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Yep,” Kenzie looked up from her phone.</p>
<p>“And Ashley?” I asked.</p>
<p>She didn’t reply, turning away to look down the length of the road. She turned around, looking the other way. In that moment, a car appeared.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a ride,” she said.</p>
<p>“Spending time with the the ol’ guardians?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t miss the word choice. The forced cavalier attitude. Awkward.</p>
<p>“I try to get as many of my appointments into the same day as I can,” Ashley said. “It’s nuisance enough to have my day disrupted with this inanity, I don’t want it taking over my weeks.”</p>
<p>“We’re inanity, are we?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“You can be,” Ashley said. “Checkups and tests, therapy, group therapy, being supervised without it being official supervision, interviews, prosthetics tune-ups, work. It becomes inane.”</p>
<p>“It’s all for good reasons,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’d do better without all of the distractions,” Ashley said. She looked at me, and she did the up-down assessment too. It was something different from what Byron had done. “I look forward to learning what you have to teach.”</p>
<p>“It was nice to meet you,” I said. I wasn’t sure if I was lying, but it seemed like the thing to say.</p>
<p>She walked down the little dirt path that extended through the grass from the building’s side door to the road. A black sedan. She opened the back door, climbed in, and closed the door with more force than was probably necessary.</p>
<p>“I have so many questions,” I said.</p>
<p>“Weld’s kind-of dad figure was the Director in charge of the Boston PRT,” Sveta said. “He was also kind of in charge of looking after Ashley, because her town was close to Boston.”</p>
<p>“Making sure she didn’t do too much damage?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. And gradually trying to get her used to the idea of cooperating with the good guys, making sure she was staying reasonably healthy. They reached out regularly, letting her know there were better options. Except that Ashley was a different Ashley.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “She’s going to be on your team?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a response for that.</p>
<p>She squeezed my arm. “I spent a lot of time with a lot of people who never got a chance, Victoria. I feel like it’s my duty to give her one.”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath, then sighed. “I don’t disagree.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t wholly agree, either?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“I… believe in second chances. Not necessarily in <em>every</em> circumstance, though, which seems to be the direction a lot of people are going.”</p>
<p>“We should walk,” Rain said. “The sooner we get where we split off in different directions, the earlier Kenzie can head back to her parents’ and make it on time for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” Kenzie said, still looking down at her phone.</p>
<p>Sveta had an umbrella. I held it so Sveta could walk while leaning on me, the two of us sharing it.</p>
<p>There weren’t many cars on the road, and even with the overcast sky making it rather dark out for the late afternoon, there weren’t many lights on either. The route we were walking put us on a long stretch of road with small businesses and restaurants on either side. Most of the illumination came from store signs in bright colors that were reflected in the puddles.</p>
<p>“I didn’t get a great read on Chris,” I said. “He’s the other big set of question marks.”</p>
<p>“I like Chris,” Kenzie said, without looking up. “He’s crazy smart about some things and adorkably stupid about others. He’s hard to figure out but when he lets you in it makes you feel special.”</p>
<p>She said something like that with no compunctions, no reservations. I almost envied her.</p>
<p>Sveta reached out and placed a hand on top of Kenzie’s hood. “It would be unfair to share Chris’ story when he didn’t want to share it himself, Victoria. I only said what I said about Ashley because she’s open about it.”</p>
<p>“In fairness, I wasn’t asking or prying,” I said. “I was remarking.”</p>
<p>“Remarking with a question mark at the end?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Inviting an answer, but not pressing for one,” I said. “I can drop it.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Kenzie said. She put her phone away. “All caught up. Stir fry for dinner, I’m going to pick up broccoli, and my workshop is warming up for later.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got a workshop, like a proper tinker,” I said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Kenzie said, dead serious.</p>
<p>“Are you hiding a jetpack inside that raincoat, or are those rocket boots?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I wish,” Kenzie said. “I can’t do that stuff. I make cameras and inconveniently big boxes. My best stuff is inconveniently big, box-shaped cameras.”</p>
<p>“Big boxes?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The term in my file is <em>emplacements</em>. Terminals, tech, and computers big enough they’re hard to move around. Like turrets, but I can’t really make good weapons or defensive things.”</p>
<p>“I see. I can see why Watchdog wanted you.”</p>
<p>“Grr, arf.”</p>
<p><em>And I might be able to see why your supervisors wanted to keep you away from the front lines.</em></p>
<p>“Out of curiosity,” I said. “Where are people? I’m trying to figure out where you guys are situated and what locations might work.”</p>
<p>“I’m from Norwalk Station,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Norwalk Station would be off to the west end of Norfair, where we had the community center incident. The ‘Nor’ part of Norfair. It was a nice-ish area. I’d passed through it a few times. “And you’re in school? Are you in the morning or afternoon block?”</p>
<p>“Morning. I joined the study block for afternoons, I keep good grades so they let me, and I have paperwork from before that says they’re not supposed to give me too much homework, so I don’t have too much to do in the afternoons.”</p>
<p>“They might expect you to check in,” I said.</p>
<p>“They might.”</p>
<p>“Weld and I are in Stratford, so is Ashley,” Sveta said. “Chris lives somewhere around here. Tristan is close to here.”</p>
<p>Here being Fairfield.</p>
<p>“Bridgeport span, here,” I said. “I’m closer to you guys in Stratford than not.”</p>
<p>“Of course I’m the furthest out,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Almost,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Almost,” Kenzie echoed him.</p>
<p>“Where are you situated?” I asked Rain.</p>
<p>“It’s complicated,” he said.</p>
<p>“Uh huh. That’s starting to sound like a catchphrase.”</p>
<p>“I hate saying it as much as people hate hearing it. Locationwise, I’ve always liked saying I’m from everywhere that isn’t anywhere.”</p>
<p>I gave him a look.</p>
<p>“Stop being vague and teasing Victoria,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’m not teasing. I’m in the middle of nowhere, it’s hard to pin down. North of Greenwich. It’s a trip to get here.”</p>
<p>That put Tristan, Byron and Chris close to center, Kenzie out west, Rain out to the far northwest, me a bit to the east, and Sveta and Ashley a bit further to the east. With the trains I was figuring it might take about four or five hours for Kenzie to get to where Sveta and Ashley were situated. It would take Rain another couple of hours, depending on how far north he was.</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty significant logistics problem,” I said. “Even in the best case scenario, if we found a place close to here, that’s a two hour or more trip for people to get here?”</p>
<p>“I could build something,” Kenzie said. “I can’t make promises.”</p>
<p>“How confident are you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Kind of confident,” she said, sounding anything but. “I haven’t done teleportation or breaking movement devices before, but if I made it a series of emplacements and built them big, then if I traveled once a week or so to visit the send-receives and make sure they don’t break down, it might work.”</p>
<p>“Tinker stuff breaks,” I said.</p>
<p>“It does,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“It would also be liable to break or break down when you needed it to work the most. During disasters, or times when there aren’t a lot of downtime.”</p>
<p>“That’s very true,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I’m wondering if there’s even a good way to go about this. I’m not trying to screw you guys up, I’m genuinely wondering.”</p>
<p>“It might not be as complicated as it seems,” Sveta said. “I can move quickly if I have to, Ashley doesn’t have much occupying her days, when she doesn’t have her appointments, and I don’t think she minds much. She’s happy to wake up early and read on the train, she even goes to the New York hub a lot, and that’s a full day trip. As for you, you can fly again&mdash;”</p>
<p>She squeezed my arm as she said it, rocking a bit side to side as she did it. I rocked a bit with her.</p>
<p>“&mdash;and the way you were talking about things, this wouldn’t be a full-time thing for you,” Sveta finished. Her enthusiasm had risen as she talked, and only dropped with that last part.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I said. “It seems you’d want a location that was closer to Kenzie and Chris then. Closer to Rain.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. He was looking around a fair bit. “I don’t mind the trips, either.”</p>
<p>“You okay?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Forgot for a short while that I have an attempt out on my life. I really should dwell on it more, to be safe, especially with Kenzie in tow.”</p>
<p>“I can hold my own,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“It’s an attempt on my life,” Rain said. “Lives could be lost. I don’t want yours to be one of them. I would feel insanely shitty if you jumped in to help and you got hurt or killed.”</p>
<p>“Insanely?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to call my ride, I think. See if she can catch me en route instead of me going to her,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“She? Erin the lady friend?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Erin the friendship I’m not going to mess with,” Rain said. He pulled out the phone and stepped a bit away, walking at the road’s edge instead of on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>We reached an intersection, and Rain stepped away, one hand to his ear while he held the phone to the other. His eyes roved, looking at nearby rooftops and the dark spaces between buildings.</p>
<p>The building at the corner of the intersection was a bar, and a group of ten or so people were standing outside, smoking. The place and the people smelled like the cheap alcohol that was barely a step above moonshine, that was being sold on the cheap in a lot of places. Made to fill a need, now a surplus, with cheap, shitty beer available to fill the need instead.</p>
<p>Their attention was on Sveta.</p>
<p>“Hey,” one called out.</p>
<p>She glanced at them, then set to ignoring them. I took her cue.</p>
<p>“Hey,” the guy called out again, drawing out the word. “Hey, you with the paint.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re going to say, I’ve heard it before,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“What the fuck’s going on with you, huh? What’s wrong with you?” he called out.</p>
<p>I turned my head to look at him. Sveta squeezed my arm, then shook her head a little.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re weird,” he called out. “You’re freaky.”</p>
<p>The light changed. We crossed, Rain trailing a bit behind, still on the phone, periodically responding. He shot the guys a dark look.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it when people are mean to you,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Thank you for that,” Sveta said. “And thank you, Victoria. I know you probably wanted to say something. I’m glad we didn’t make it into a thing.”</p>
<p>“Does it happen a lot?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Some. It beats people running away and screaming, and the running and screaming part beat people dying because of me,” Sveta said. “This is an improvement. Things will improve more in the future. I believe that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Me too.”</p>
<p>“Me too,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Sveta put a hand on Kenzie’s hooded head, squeezed my arm.</p>
<p>“My ride’s here,” Rain said, catching up with us, waving at a distant vehicle with its headlights on. I got a better view of it as it pulled up beside us. It wasn’t a pretty vehicle &mdash; a van with rust around the right headlight. “We’ve got a good long drive back. Was good seeing you guys, good to meet you, Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Good to meet you, Rain,” I said.</p>
<p>The driver stuck her hand out, waving. We moved around to where we could see her through the passenger-side window.</p>
<p>Erin, Rain’s friendship he wasn’t intending to mess with, was not the kind of person I imagined driving a van like that, or spending time with someone of Rain’s somewhat grungy, not-inclined-to-smile presentation. There were women where someone’s first thought might be ‘they could be a model’ and there were women where the first thought was ‘they <em>have</em> to be a model, it’s not fair if they aren’t’. She was the latter. Short black hair with a long swoop at the front, dangly jewelry, more piercings in one ear, and one of the memorial shirts, much like how the dress I was wearing served as a way for me to represent and remember Brockton Bay. She was from New York, it seemed, or she wanted to represent it.</p>
<p>“Erin, you’ve seen Kenzie and Sveta before.”</p>
<p>“Hi again,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“And this is Victoria. We were talking about having her be our coach.”</p>
<p>“Hi,” Erin said, leaning toward Rain to get a better view of me, extending her hand in another wave. Rain looked momentarily like a deer in the headlights with Erin’s face close, with Erin doing a very good job at not noticing or not looking like she’d noticed. “You look a lot like Glory Girl.”</p>
<p>“I am,” I said. “I was.”</p>
<p>“Huh,” Erin said. “That’s really cool. Maybe I’ll see you around?”</p>
<p>“It’s likely,” I said.</p>
<p>“You guys have a good night.”</p>
<p>“You too,” Kenzie said. She held up her phone, like she was trying to get a signal. “Drive safe.”</p>
<p>“We good to go?” Erin asked.</p>
<p>“Yep,” Rain said. “You want a ride somewhere convenient, Kenz?”</p>
<p>“Sure!”</p>
<p>Kenzie climbed in behind Rain, giving us a wave before the door was closed.</p>
<p>Just Sveta and me left.</p>
<p>We watched as the van pulled away.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of sympathy for Rain,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about the attempt on his life or the long car trip with the girl he very clearly likes?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, the dangerous thing too,” Sveta said. “Mostly the long trip.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“But that’s all negative. We’re going in the same direction, right? We can catch up?”</p>
<p>“We can definitely catch up. I want to hear more about that vacation.”</p>
<p>“And you can come over for dinner, right? Sometime? You’re not far. I can’t promise a <em>good</em> dinner, because I’m still trying to find food that Weld can really taste that won’t make the neighbors evacuate their apartments, but there’s takeout! Or delivery. I’m sure there’s something we can do.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t keep me away,” I said.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Sleep eluded me. I stood on the balcony, I stared out at a city without nearly enough lights or light in it, a jagged and incomplete skyline, and I tried to shake a persistent melancholy I couldn’t put my finger on.</p>
<p>The day had been a good one. My friendship with Sveta rekindled, with Sveta doing as well as I could hope for, possibilities for the future, interesting puzzles to work out, and I’d been able to do favors for people I cared about.</p>
<p>A part of it was the therapy. It was strange, to be in a place mentally and emotionally where therapy had a cost to it, in a way. The voice of Mrs. Yamada and the tone of the conversations reminded me of the darkest period in my life. Those reminders were probably responsible for the nightmares that had torn me from sleep.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be good if I called the new therapist, a new voice.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the nightmares that kept me from getting back to sleep, but a restless nagging feeling. I liked problems I could decisively solve, things I could tell myself I had an answer for, something I could handle in the dawn, and then I could go back to sleep. The feeling that had settled with me wasn’t that sort of answerable question.</p>
<p>It was the restless nagging that had me carefully and slowly open the sliding door of the balcony, step into the living room, and gather some things. A bag with my wallet and things, fresher clothes, the mask I’d worn for the broken trigger incident.</p>
<p>I went flying, and my destination wasn’t one that would answer the nagging feeling, but one that could answer other, more concrete questions. With luck, I’d be able to distract myself.</p>
<p>There were cities and areas I’d considered for the therapy group’s expedition. Ones in need, ones I knew didn’t fall neatly in one jurisdiction or another. I used the highways and major roadways as my waypoints, so I wouldn’t pass them or find myself flying too far north or south.</p>
<p>The sun was rising by the time I reached the first. Sherwood span. Too low a population, I could tell right away. Too many farms, the houses too spread out.</p>
<p>It took me twenty minutes to reach the next. The area was slow to wake up, which was a surprise, given the amount of construction sites I could see from above. Usually the work started first thing.</p>
<p>It was a nice slice of city, with a view of the water, tall buildings, shiny, modern, with nice, large houses, but it was only halfway erected.  There were cars in driveways, but there wasn’t much life.</p>
<p>I flew low, stopping at one of the gates to a construction site for a taller building.</p>
<p>Laminated sheets had been put up on the gates.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Construction suspended until we’re given what we’re owed.</em></p>
<p>The same was on display in other places, with laminated sheets of paper and graffiti. Some of it was angrier.</p>
<p>I was reading a very bold, large bit of text about how certain people should be choking on cocks, when I saw I had company, standing in the corner of my field of view. A cape.</p>
<p>I turned to face them.</p>
<p>Not anyone I recognized. A man in armor with spikes on it. Plate mail, and plate armor was hard to get done right, especially in this modern day. He carried no weapon I could see. Spiky plate armor wasn’t exactly original or new, either.</p>
<p>He didn’t say anything or do anything, but he was holding a piece of paper.</p>
<p>I approached him, my forcefield up. He didn’t budge.</p>
<p>When I was in arm’s reach, he put his gauntlet toward me, paper in hand. I dropped my forcefield to take it.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t someone who sounded more intimidating from the inside of a helmet. His voice was very normal as he said, “We saw you fly in, we discussed, we called some people, this is our message to you.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” I said. I looked around. “Quiet town.”</p>
<p>When my head was turned, he reached for my throat.</p>
<p>I put my forcefield up, and I knocked his hand aside, forcefully enough I almost put him on his ass. The sound rang in my ears.</p>
<p>“Our town,” he said.</p>
<p>That said, he trudged off.</p>
<p>I watched him go, and then I walked in the opposite direction. People were watching from doorsteps with coffee in hand, or standing by cars, now.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to back down or look weak, not if this was possibly a place I might be visiting with any regularity, so I walked slowly, like I wasn’t bothered.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I still stopped in my tracks when I read the note.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Turn around and fly home, Glory Hole<br>
</em>-TT</p>
<p>They’d asked around, huh?</p>
<p>I folded the paper up, and I held the folded square as I walked, thinking, observing. A slice of city, paralyzed, a clear villain presence.</p>
<p>The guy with the spikes might have been Cleat. A low-tier cape with some background in fighting rings and mercenary work. Unlike most in fighting rings, he’d never found enough success to get traction in other circles. Ironically.</p>
<p>I’d left Brockton Bay in the middle of a situation, or I’d been taken from the city during. I’d put in the hours and put heart and soul into trying to combat the badness that was taking over the city, and at the end of the day, I hadn’t ever enjoyed a resolution to that situation. I’d never felt like I’d made enough of a difference in the end result.</p>
<p>It was tempting, the idea of coming here to a place like this and somehow completing that journey or using a success here to convince myself I could have made a proper difference if I’d been given a chance.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t about me. It was about those teenagers and kids in Yamada’s group.</p>
<p>A sign was erected by one construction site. It was covered in graffiti. ‘Cedar Point Apartments’ was written at the top, but ‘Cedar’ had been covered over in paint, and ‘Hollow’ had been written in its place.</p>
<p>Cute, and from some cursory investigation, the rebranding had been performed elsewhere, throughout the district. Graffiti and other signs of anger were clear as day, much of it vile and senseless.</p>
<p>Did I really want to pit those kids against this? They might give it a shot, and if it was insurmountable, Mrs. Yamada might be happy, and if it was surmountable, everyone would be happy.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>I looked at the graffiti, getting a sense of the atmosphere here. Vulgarity, vulgarity, obscenity, drawing of vulgarity, hate, anger, vulgarity, possible gang tag, ‘hollow point’ appearing again.</p>
<p>I stopped in front of another piece of graffiti. It wasn’t crowded in with anything else, so it stood out, almost a piece of art in how it was spelled out on a ruined wall, half-toppled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE NOW</p>
<p>I had the paper in my hand, I had my doubts, but the nagging feeling ceased being nagging and became acutely clear as I looked at the statement.</p>
<p>“Fuck that,” I said.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap26">Flare &mdash; Interlude 2</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“Long coat, long hair, just got through the door, has a gun,” Crystalclear said, thumb on the button of his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>The reply from the officers was almost impossible to make out.</p>
<p>The status quo in quiet periods was for there to be two thinkers on duty at all times. They were meant to be in communication and watching each other’s backs, and they were meant to be cooperating with the officers stationed at the portal.</p>
<p>During the quieter times, it would have been less than perfect for his partner to be in the midst of the crowd, where it took effort for Crystalclear to keep track of him and watch the man’s back.</p>
<p>Relay, one of his new teammates.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a quiet period, as one of the day’s bigger trains had just arrived. There were supposed to be four people on duty, one shift nearly over, another just beginning, for twice the number of eyes and powers on the scene.</p>
<p>Yes, it could have been an accident that the other two had yet to arrive. But accidents and coincidences could just as easily be contrivances at the hands of masterminds. The radios acting up didn’t help matters.</p>
<p>“&mdash;ot the gun, good ca&mdash;” the voice on the other side of the walkie talkie reported, the static cutting off the very beginning and the ending.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the officers had the woman in the coat. One of the officers had the gun, now.</p>
<p><i>Red jacket, jeans, pointed boots,</i> <i>group of three,</i> Relay communicated. Words and ideas conveyed without being spoken. Not telepathy, not sound, but impressions.</p>
<p>Crystalclear’s vision didn’t give him color that wasn’t the blurring around the white outlines that defined everything. Red jacket meant nothing to him. But he could see the crowd, seeing everyone at once, and he could check the shoes. It took some focus to narrow things down, to look for the pointed shoes, to observe for another few moments to see who was grouped up.</p>
<p>Three people, all about the same age, all men. Their heads radiated with distortions. Their focus&mdash; not on anything in particular. He saw what they were dwelling on as a series of fractures, distorted angles, and breaks that surrounded them. These things suggested things about what was going on in their heads that were more limited to the moment, covering stresses in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>Stress as in emotional upset, stressing the importance of something, stress as in tension and wear.</p>
<p>He was glad he could use the landline for this. The little room was separated from the portal and train platforms by two walls, one with a one-way pane of glass set in it. The third wall was open, so he was free to step outside and be in the thick of things within seconds, without having to worry about doors or counters. Beside him was a phone and a computer he hadn’t bothered to fiddle with &mdash; he couldn’t see the contents of the screen without pulling a crystal from his face.</p>
<p>He hit the button for channel one on the phone, then picked up.</p>
<p>“Relay reports there’s three people incoming. He got a low-level bad feeling about them. They seem stressed to me. Not an imminent danger. You might want to pull them out of line and have a chat. One in the lead has a red jacket, pointed shoes. I’ll give you more information on their positions once they’re settled in line.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Thank you, Crystalclear.”</p>
<p>“Let us know if you need anyone to sit in,” he said.</p>
<p>“Will do.”</p>
<p>He was aware as heads throughout the crowd turned, their focus shifting to Relay, to the train, to the officers. For most, the light around them refracted into kaleidoscopic structures, cone or beak shaped, pointed this way and that. At the ends farthest from the points of focus, the open ends of the cones splayed out into nimbuses, auras, fractures.</p>
<p>He had been one of them, a year ago, a refugee stepping off the train to enter Earth Gimel, finding his luggage, walking up the short set of stairs to the desks, where people clustered in families and groups of friends, rather than in single file. They would be interviewed, they would be given temporary identification, and they would get their packages with information and resources.</p>
<p>Unlike many of them, he had waited nearly six months for access, because he’d been open about the fact he had powers. A mistake, because they had wanted to be careful, it had meant he had needed weeks and months of screens, of interviews and background checks, while other people passed through.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time something like that had happened, where he had taken too long to put the pieces together. All thinkers had their weaknesses and catches &mdash; all powers, probably, but thinkers were what he was most familiar with, and thinkers almost always had their issues with the mind. The problems of the mind were difficult to identify and fix, because they were so invisible, and the tools for diagnosis were often what part of what was broken or altered.</p>
<p>He had taken a considerable length of time to figure out the nuances of his power, too. The most obvious aspect was that he could see through walls, but he lost the ability to see and understand people, to see their faces or easily grasp the clothes they wore.</p>
<p>There was so much more to it, and he was learning more of it every week and month. The colors meant things, and he had only worked out the blues and the reds. Other colors separated from the white at times. There were a lot of greens in the crowd and along the station, pulling away from the outlines. He had ideas about what they meant, but he couldn’t say anything with confidence.</p>
<p>The fractures and formations in distortions around people were another part of it. There were elements to the way things broke up and distorted that had deeper meaning, things he didn’t understand in a way he could explain, but which made it easy for him to relate one personality and personality type to another, familiar one.</p>
<p>The portal took up much of the station in front of him. His multifaceted senses covered the tract of Gimel surrounding the portal, and the areas of Bet on the far side. His view encompassed the surroundings on the other side, the people, the terrain, and the different colors that bled out from the sharper white outlines.</p>
<p><em>You’re in the weeds</em>, Relay communicated.</p>
<p>Crystalclear lifted his walkie-talkie to his mouth. “Weeds?”</p>
<p><em>Not entirely with us. Lost, or in a bit of a daze.</em></p>
<p>Crystalclear looked out beyond the portal. At the people amassed around it, human-shaped outlines with the outlines of clothes, blurs smearing around the white lines, their heads replaced with fractured, kaleidoscopic messes. A large group were in eerie unison. Singing together, possibly, or chanting.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he replied, one more word for what others would perceive as a one-sided conversation.</p>
<p>It was his perpetual reality. To be mundane, or to be lost. The knowledge out of his reach, there if he could find out how to reach for it or connect it.</p>
<p>He focused more on the crowd.</p>
<p>His difficulty wasn’t in tracking everyone, so much as it was finding the right angles. He didn’t have eyes with his power deployed like this, and he wasn’t limited to one point of view. He set about making sure he could investigate everyone and their carry-on baggage without anyone being hidden with their outline closely matching someone they were standing in front of or behind.</p>
<p>He didn’t move his head as he looked back, up the stairs and out at the loosely organized lines of people. The trio had joined the line.</p>
<p>He used the phone, “The three people Relay wanted you guys to keep an eye out for just joined the line. They’re behind a shorter, elderly couple. One of them’s agitated.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Crystalclear,” the voice on the phone replied.</p>
<p>While more of his focus was dwelling in that direction and area, making sure he was seeing everything from the necessary angles, he became aware of two people who others were paying a great deal of attention to.</p>
<p>One of them was tall, somewhat muscular, but what stood out was the storm of fractures around his head, overlapping without connecting to one another. A crown of thorns, fashioned from something that looked like especially precise breaks in glass or deep-etched frost.</p>
<p>The other was smaller, hunched over. She was almost the opposite, the breaks vague, cracking out to reach like a whip, aimed at nothing in particular.</p>
<p>He used the walkie-talkie, “I think our relief just turned up.”</p>
<p><em>Making my way to you.</em></p>
<p>Relay and the two individuals reached Crystalclear’s booth at the same time. Crystalclear stepped out, aware of the number of people who were turning to look. He tried to keep an eye on the crowd.</p>
<p>Relay made the introductions. “Crystalclear, this is Big Picture, and this is Ratcatcher.”</p>
<p>“Hello,” Big Picture said. More tight loops of breakage encircled his head rapidfire as he turned it to look at Crystalclear, and the loops bled like purple watercolor paint.</p>
<p>“Hello,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“Hello. We’re the reinforthmenth,” Ratcatcher said, with a heavy lisp.</p>
<p>“You’re new to Foresight?” Big Picture asked.</p>
<p>“I am,” Crystalclear said. “Only positives so far.”</p>
<p>“I thought about joining,” Big Picture said. “I decided it was better to wait until things settled down. For now, I get paid for this, I keep it simple.”</p>
<p>“Yeth. Thimple ith good,” Ratcatcher said.</p>
<p>“I like the costume,” Big Picture said.</p>
<p>Crystalclear touched the tunic portion of his outfit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything like he’d worn with the Norfair Neighborhood Heroes. A single shoulderpad, a piece of cloth forming a kind of shawl or mantle as it extended from one corner of the shoulderpad near his heart, over his shoulder, and around to the back corner of the shoulderpad near his shoulderblade. The shoulderpad, the armor at his wrists and the armor around his legs had chunks of crystal, closely matched to the crystal that he naturally produced. Lightweight as armor went, limited to a few pieces that were as decorative as functional, but it was still armor. A band of metal ran along his chin’s edge, and that took some particular getting used to.</p>
<p>“Appreciated,” Crystalclear said. It was odd to reply when he was only aware of the outlines of the outfit. He had seen it in the mirror when he had been getting ready, but that memory felt faint, and he had yet to see how put together he looked with the crystals at the upper half of his face.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go get back to work,” Relay said. “I’ll be in communication.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear returned to his seat. Big Picture stood out in the open, his arms folded.</p>
<p>Ratcatcher joined Crystalclear in the booth, sitting on the counter by the phone.</p>
<p>“What do you do, Crythtalclear?” Ratcatcher asked.</p>
<p>“I see through walls. I can see contraband.”</p>
<p>“I can too,” Ratcatcher said. “I thee thmall thingth, wherever they are.”</p>
<p>“We might be redundant then.”</p>
<p>“Redundancy can help,” Big Picture said.</p>
<p>“Can you share your power, Big Picture?”</p>
<p>Big picture turned his head. Crystalclear wished he could see the big guy’s face. Knowing if the guy was frowning or smiling would help a great deal.</p>
<p>“It’s redundancy,” Big Picture said. He made a sound, almost a laugh. “Everything I want to focus on, I clone my brain and my mind. I can give each and every detail every bit of my attention, and I can slow down my perceptions if I want to study it more. There are a few other nuances, other things I can do with the parallel takes, sharing, but you don’t need all of the details.”</p>
<p>“You can spend the equivalent of a few minutes studying every possible clue?” Crystalclear asked.</p>
<p>“Weeks. Months, if I want.”</p>
<p>“Sounds as if it could have its drawbacks.”</p>
<p>“Don’t we all?” Big Picture asked.</p>
<p>Crystalclear was aware that Ratcatcher wasn’t alone. He turned his head a little, then pointed at the pocket of Ratcatcher’s top. It was a sleeveless top, tight-fitting in the way a costume was supposed to be, but it had a hoodie-like pouch in the front. There was a small life form in there, the thing’s perspective fuzzy in a way that suggested it was asleep, in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Ratcatcher made a pleased sound, then reached into the pouch. The disturbance woke the creature, but she didn’t act like it was upset as she held it in her two hands.</p>
<p>Crystalclear could guess what the thing was from its dimensions and Ratcatcher’s name. “Does it have a name?”</p>
<p>“Raththputin,” Ratcatcher said. She picked up a walkie-talkie, “The attractive older gentleman in the peacoat, hairy earth and eyelatheth to die for. Thomething thown into the coat. Naughty.”</p>
<p>“…I can see Ratcatcher has joined us…” the walkie talkie buzzed in response. The buzzing turned into crackling. “…nimize colorful commenta…”</p>
<p>“Radio’th garbage today,” Ratcatcher observed.</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry we’re late,” Big Picture said. “Feels like we took a step backward, citywide. There’s word of a potential transportation strike. Our usual bus driver didn’t show, we had to wait for the next. Construction sites between NYC and Boston are locked down, they aren’t doing anything except getting in the way.”</p>
<p>“Feels like we should be out there, not here,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“I know that feeling. It’s often a trap.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear turned toward Big Picture.</p>
<p>“I joined the military, before I got powers. I was thinking something similar when I did. That things at home were shit, but I was needed out there. We didn’t fix anything out there, and we came home to find things were worse.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear was going to reply, but he was interrupted by the lisping young woman.</p>
<p>“Buckthom lady thtepping off the train,” Ratcatcher said. “Bra that doethn’t fit, run in her thtocking. Cavity thearch, if you pleathe.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t you being funny again, Rat?” Big Picture asked.</p>
<p>“I’m being good, thank you very mush.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear looked. There was something suspended in the middle of the blur that was the woman. He held up his walkie-talkie. “Seconding Ratcatcher on this one. She’s got something stowed.”</p>
<p><em>I see her,</em> Relay communicated. <em>Noise surrounding her is similar to a few others we spotted earlier.</em></p>
<p>“I remember,” Crystalclear said, through the walkie talkie. He’d noticed but he hadn’t been sure how common it was or how much of a thread ran through it all until he’d had it point out. That weakness of his again. “There have been one or two of these small-time smugglers on every train, all day.”</p>
<p>Big Picture said, “It might be worth checking what’s going on in Bet. Could be a gang, strong-arming people into going through, or offering a head start in Gimel if they’ll smuggle something through.”</p>
<p>“It might not go that well,” Crystalclear said. “Too easy to get sucked in right from the start, not being allowed to leave once you’ve made that delivery.”</p>
<p>“The ugly kid with the runny nothe hath clutter in hith bag. Thyringeth.”</p>
<p>“…heckin…” the radio crackled.</p>
<p>Big Picture picked up his walkie talkie, “The woman with him isn’t his mother, either. Better to have them get picked out of line and taken away for an interview.”</p>
<p>The radio crackled with the affirmative.</p>
<p>Slowly, the train and the platform emptied. They kept an eye out for the drugs, for the violence, for the people who were especially angry or scared.</p>
<p>One of the train cars remained filled. Crystalclear looked through, and saw the people within sitting, calm, not reaching for their things.</p>
<p>“What’s the status of car five?” he asked. “There are a few guns in there.”</p>
<p>Ratcatcher pulled the keyboard closer to her, she typed and then responded, “Thpecial cathe. VIP.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got a case fifty-three in there.”</p>
<p>“Weld, according to the computer. Ethcorting.”</p>
<p>“Weld,” Crystalclear said. He was familiar with the name. “Good to know.”</p>
<p><em>Crowd is thinning out</em>, Relay communicated. <em>I’ll go say hi</em>.</p>
<p>Crystalclear watched as people sorted out. The platform emptied, and the officers on the scene did what they could to get others moving along, helping with bags and pointing people in the right direction.</p>
<p>“You’re bleeding,” Ratcatcher observed.</p>
<p>“Me?” Crystalclear asked.</p>
<p>“At the corner of your eye,” she said.</p>
<p>He checked, touching the spot in question and finding the bead of blood with his sense of touch. Sure enough, she was right. “It’s a thing that happens. Doesn’t mean anything. Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Eckthuthed,” she said.</p>
<p>He touched one of the crystals that was sticking up and out of that eye socket, gripped it, and hauled it free. He could feel the glass edge slide against the inside of his eyelid, the root of it hauling free of the floor of his eye socket, and he could feel the fluids inside his eye stir.</p>
<p>“You jutht made it worth,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I never bleed for long. I try to be careful, so I don’t scare people, but it doesn’t bother me much.”</p>
<p>“Good to know,” she said. “I know all about that.”</p>
<p>He pulled it free, a foot-long block of crystal, and laid it carefully down on the counter. He blinked a few times with his one eye, noticed that Ratcatcher had taken off her mask, gray furred and full-face, and decided to keep his gaze averted, for privacy’s sake, and because looking at her would let her see his face.</p>
<p>He concentrated, and he produced another chunk of glass, feeling it stab from the underside of his eye and out, sliding through everything in the way without doing real damage. He was careful to shape it in his mind so there wouldn’t be any sharp edges resting against his eyelid or brow.</p>
<p>He turned his face Ratcatcher’s way. “How do I look? Symmetrical?”</p>
<p>“Yeth.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>
<p>“Thank <em>you</em>,” she said, with emphasis on the ‘you’.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Not many people look me in the fathe when my mathk is off and keep from flinching,” she said.</p>
<p>Crystalclear’s response was cut short.</p>
<p><em>Weld wants us,</em> Relay said. <em>Diplomatic thing</em>.</p>
<p>“Weld is asking for me,” Crystalclear said. “Good luck, guys.”</p>
<p>“We’ll get to know each other, I’m sure,” Big Picture said.</p>
<p>“Good luck,” Ratcatcher said.</p>
<p>Relay was already coordinating the officers. The path that led from platform to the intake center was being closed off, a metal shuttered door sliding closed. Another set of doors were being unlocked and opened.</p>
<p>VIPs indeed, it seemed, and from what Crystalclear could see, they were only human.</p>
<p>Crystalclear approached the train car, standing beside Relay. Weld and Narwhal were standing nearby.</p>
<p>Narwhal looked rather <em>spectacular</em> to Crystalclear’s vision, given the emphasis on outlines, and her having dressed up in very small, outlined objects.</p>
<p>“Look after them,” she said. “I’ll see the way is clear.”</p>
<p>“Got it,” Weld said. “You would be Crystalclear?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Good to meet you. I didn’t think you were one of us.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m not. I can go from this to… not this,” Crystalclear said. He was suddenly aware he wasn’t sure what terminology was okay or not okay with the C-53s.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. Closer to Narwhal than anything, then. I’ve heard good things, Crystalclear. Foresight is lucky to have you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Likewise, with you and the Wardens.”</p>
<p>“Were you around for that broken trigger incident a week and a half ago?”</p>
<p>“I was,” Crystalclear said. “I wasn’t in a position to do much.”</p>
<p>“This situation here follows from that. We’ve got visitors, and we want to keep things calm and safe. Foresight said we should make use of you and Relay to help keep an eye on things.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Crystalclear said. “Alright.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. “Are you okay to do this?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Crystalclear said. He realized he didn’t sound confident, and tried again. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure it <em>was</em> alright. He’d been volunteered for something and he hadn’t explicitly been told. It was a level of disconnection from the authority that felt uncomfortably familiar and disconcerting.</p>
<p>It made him think of his aunt. It also made him think of Big Picture’s statements about it being better to wait.</p>
<p>“We’re bodyguards and protection for the Gimel side of things. The other guys brought their own protection.”</p>
<p><em>The other guys?</em> Crystalclear thought.</p>
<p>All thinkers had their weaknesses. Most hated not knowing things. Most, by way of how their powers gave them an edge in one respect, had a way of missing other things. Crystalclear’s vision gave him a lot, but it made some obvious things impossible to grasp.</p>
<p>Crystalclear’s focus broadened as he tried to take in everything necessary to keep an eye on things. He looked at the crowd, noted who was reacting to the shutters being closed, and tried to keep tabs on them. He watched the other heroes, tracked the officers, and tried to wrap his head around the fractured messes that were their heads and the ever-shifting contents of those heads.</p>
<p>“Ratcatcher seemed to take to you,” Relay commented.</p>
<p>“Did she?” Crystalclear asked.</p>
<p>“That’s the impression I got. You didn’t seem too bothered, either.”</p>
<p>“She seemed like a nice kid. Weird but good.”</p>
<p>Relay made a small sound. “Don’t, uh, say that around her. She’s older than you. Heh.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear smiled, but he felt just a little anxious. There were things he had liked about the NNH group with Tempera, Longscratch and Fume Hood. Big Picture had talked about the merits of simplicity.</p>
<p>Thinker issues. He hated being out of the loop. It constantly felt like he was. Even when it was with things that pertained to himself.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Relay said. He’d apparently picked something up.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>The group was departing the train, now.</p>
<p>“We’ll be using the emergency stairwell,” Relay said. “We go upstairs, we’ll find a vantage point, they’ll have their meeting with the people who are already waiting there, then a few of them are going to go tour Gimel. Things are out of our hands once they do, they’ve been warned about that. The newcomers want to see the city they’ve been helping to build.”</p>
<p>“I heard about some of this,” Crystalclear said. “These are people from an alternate Earth?”</p>
<p>He didn’t get his answer, as the people approached.</p>
<p>Three men, with their entourage, men with guns. Their heads were interesting. Leader and soldier, they were very in sync, much like the group that was still gathered outside the Bet portal were of similar minds as they chanted or sang together. They felt like an odd fit. Foreign worlders?</p>
<p><em>Leaders of Earth Cheit. Abrahamic theocrats. They’re our guests, here about the people of theirs who died in the broken trigger incident.</em> </p>
<p>A serious subject. Crystalclear was aware of a few other things that had come up in regard to the group, until the broken trigger had consumed everyone’s attention. The discussions in the late-night media had been derailed by the deaths of the ninety-two individuals caught by the broken trigger.</p>
<p>“If you’ll follow us,” Weld said.</p>
<p>They walked up the stairs, with Weld in front, and Relay and Crystalclear toward the rear. The armed guard trailed even further behind, with one waiting at the base of the stairwell.</p>
<p>They had a bit of a distance to walk to reach the room at the top. It looked like a ball room, with fancy curtains, a lacquered floor, and lots of empty space. A table was set to one side, and there were curtains closed that didn’t stop the light from passing through. Sheers, possibly, to obscure the view of the world outside, or perhaps more importantly, to obscure those on the outside from seeing those within.</p>
<p>People were seated at the table already, paperwork around them.</p>
<p>The one closest to the door was a serious looking woman, slender, in a blouse and a skirt that highlighted how narrow she was. The belt of her skirt cinched in at the waist, emphasizing her figure. She had a lot of the anxiety that the refugees departing the train had had, but she didn’t show it in how she sat or how she moved as she stood to greet the men.</p>
<p><em>Sierra Kiley,</em> Relay communicated. <em>Board member of Rock Bay Reconstruction Group. That’s one of the biggest construction firms, with its roots in Brockton Bay. She’s a candidate for mayor of the Megalopolis, but she’s not expected to win. Foresight thinks she has her hat in the ring for other reasons. Access, possibly. We know she has ties to organized crime, if you couldn’t guess from her background in Brockton Bay. She doesn’t necessarily know we know.</em></p>
<p>Next were a couple, male and female. She wore a nice suit-dress. He wore a dress shirt, slacks, and carried the paperwork. Their focus was sharp, they clearly worked well together from how well they coordinated. As with Big Picture, there was something else going on with the man’s perceptions. He wasn’t a cone&mdash; his perceptions were covering a lot of ground, and his fractures were very different from the norm. They were closer to being etches.</p>
<p><em>Jeanne Wynn and her assistant. CEO of Mortari, second of the large construction groups</em>. <em>Jeanne might be too. She’s a more serious candidate for mayor, she’s running, she and a lot of others think she’ll win.</em></p>
<p>Crystalclear was bothered that he was getting filled in on things he already had some knowledge of, but felt disconnected in other things. He’d known about Jeanne. She had recently put up her proposals online, for how she wanted and expected to run things if she won.</p>
<p>The person who won mayorship of Gimel, if they weren’t killed in an uprising, would likely go on to be leader of Gimel as a whole.</p>
<p><em>We suspect the assistant is a parahuman.</em> </p>
<p>He was, Crystalclear knew. He resolved to communicate that when he could.</p>
<p>Others were named and identified by Relay. Mr. Nieves, another prospective mayor, though he didn’t have the footing the others did, his chances were better than Ms. Kiley’s. Mr. Buckner was at the forefront of the burgeoning media enterprise in Gimel, bringing television to the masses.</p>
<p><em>Stay put and stay silent</em>.</p>
<p>The voice wasn’t Relay’s, but it was easy to imagine as Relay’s, with it being so vivid.</p>
<p>Crystalclear had a confused and fractured memory of his early childhood. The woman he remembered growing up with was not the woman he’d spent his late childhood and adolescence with. His aunt had explained the situation for him, saying his mother hadn’t been well, he’d been taken away from her for his safety.</p>
<p>She had said a lot of things over the years. He had believed most, and because other things had occupied his attention, he hadn’t given the remainder enough focus.</p>
<p>Normally, trigger events emphasizing isolation, loss, cut ties, and betrayal tended to lead to master powers. Or, rather, master powers tended to go to people who were going to deal with those situations.</p>
<p>Any attachment he had felt to his aunt had faded over the years, long before he had triggered. She hadn’t cared. So long as he behaved and didn’t cause a fuss, she had been happy to not have to devote much attention to him. There was nothing lost, so that aspect of things hadn’t factored in.</p>
<p>So, naturally, he had avoided causing a fuss.</p>
<p>It had only been later that their fragile reality had come crashing down around them. The police were closing in on him, he was no longer young, and where a young, clean cut white boy had flown under the radar, a teenaged white boy with pimples hadn’t. It had turned out that his aunt wasn’t his aunt at all. Her only relation to him was that she had stolen him from his real mother.</p>
<p>The questions had come, hours of interrogation, his lawyer guiding him. Hadn’t he put the pieces together? Hadn’t he seen? Why hadn’t he asked more questions? He hadn’t looked at what he was delivering to homes even once in the past few years?</p>
<p>No, he’d said. No, he’d never looked. He had never really considered. He had only wanted to exist.</p>
<p>The police had been upset, angry, hostile. His lawyer had been frustrated, because anything, anything at all could have led to a plea deal or him getting off free. His ‘aunt’ and her boyfriend were upset, because they blamed him for their being arrested, and they had used a proxy to threaten him.</p>
<p>He had been sufficiently scared and lost to trigger.</p>
<p>Now he stood guard. He was trying to exist, to do what good he could, and he wanted to pay a little more attention than he once had, even as his power made that very easy on the surface and very difficult when it came to the deeper analysis.</p>
<p>The initial introductions were wrapping up. The theocrats of Cheit were saying a brief prayer, heads bowed.</p>
<p>People settled into their seats, empty seats between groups, serving as a kind of separation.</p>
<p>“War.”</p>
<p>One word. It had been said by the lead theocrat, no preamble, and it was enough to be followed by silence.</p>
<p>“I say it not because I believe in it or want it,” he went on, “But because the people at home wanted me to convey it.”</p>
<p>“We’ve had a strong working relationship thus far,” Jeanne said.</p>
<p>“We have,” the theocrat said.</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” Nieves said. “I’m lost. It came up before, but things got in the way. What exactly is the working relationship?”</p>
<p>Jeanne explained, “Cheit has graciously provided Earth Gimel with supplies for reconstruction. They supplied us with food and other things that enabled us to weather the first winter. A hard season.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” Nieves said. “I know this much. But what exactly did Cheit get in the bargain?”</p>
<p>“Goodwill,” the theocrat said.</p>
<p>“Goodwill?” Nieves asked.</p>
<p>“We have an awful lot of very awful people at our disposal, to put things lightly,” Kiley said. “We don’t really think anyone wants actual war, do we?”</p>
<p>“As I was instructed, I brought it up,” the theocrat said. “It is officially on the table.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear was still, listening. He didn’t miss the glance that Weld and Narwhal shared. Neither of them budged an inch.</p>
<p>“Goodwill is a matter of faith,” Jeanne said. “The understanding was that they would share their excess, out of the goodness of their hearts. We, in turn, would manage our own.”</p>
<p>“Six of Earth Cheit’s citizens are dead. Five godly men and a woman, all with their families. By all accounts, they died in a terrible, protracted way.”</p>
<p>“Because of a broken trigger,” Jeanne said. “Outside of our control. Surely you understand.”</p>
<p>“These ‘triggers’, as we understand it, are the result of strife and upset. Your people were upset because of how Mortari and RBR have handled your subordinates.”</p>
<p>Crystalclear watched carefully, his eyes on all of the people present, on the nearby rooftops, and on the area below, to make sure nobody was attempting entry.</p>
<p>Jeanne and the theocrat seemed to be the ones in control over this conversation. Jeanne had a parahuman with her, and the parahuman was studying the room, but nothing suggested he was communicating with his superior. Nothing about the way things refracted and moved around his head, nothing about the colors. Purple here and there, but spotty, brief.</p>
<p>If she was a superior at all, that was. It was very possible the ‘assistant’ was the one truly in charge.</p>
<p>“What would you have us do?” Kiley asked.</p>
<p>The theocrat answered, “We want you to be in control. Control your people, organize, avoid similar situations. We are happy to be generous to our less fortunate neighbors, but we cannot have your troubles become our troubles.”</p>
<p>“We’re working on that,” Kiley said.</p>
<p>“Are you married, Ms. Kiley?” the theocrat asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how that’s relevant.”</p>
<p>“That would be a no, then. I prefer to work with married individuals, like Mrs. Wynn here. They understand the difficulties of a long term relationship, the compromises and deeper knowledge it takes to make things work.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be where I am if I wasn’t competent. Trust me, Mr. Aguirre, I’ve earned my place.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve heard,” the theocrat answered. His tone was such that it was as cutting a response as an outright denial or dismissal. “Mrs. Wynn, you’re prepared to organize and control things?”</p>
<p>“We’ve already taken steps. You’ll see measurable change in coming weeks.”</p>
<p>“Good. Ms. Kiley, you’re welcome to prove me wrong in my judgment about you. A lot depends on this. We are happy to keep supplying you with everything you could need, we believe in generosity, but it’s contingent on your successes. We know which pies each of you have your fingers in. If one of you succeed, we’ll gladly back you. If both succeed, we’ll back you both. If others step up and prove themselves, we’ll back them.”</p>
<p>“Provided we do well enough at making the most of what you provide.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t disappoint,” the theocrat said. He placed his hand on the paperwork in front of him. “You know what’s on the table.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kiley said, “I don’t think I’m in your good books, Mr. Aguirre, I think I don’t lower myself any further in your eyes by saying this&mdash;”</p>
<p>“What you say or don’t say has little to do with what I feel about you, Ms. Kiley. I believe in <em>deeds</em>.”</p>
<p>“&mdash;You do not want a war with Gimel. We have so very little to lose, and I can tell you, I know this very well. We have some very awful people at our disposal. You can threaten bombs and armies. We can threaten nightmares come to life and life turned to nightmares.”</p>
<p>“I believe you,” Aguirre said. “I know the kinds of people you interact with, Ms. Kiley. Part of the reason I’m here is that I’ve worked directly with some individuals and situations of that breed, who appeared in Cheit. I wish I could say with confidence that I could make the people I report to believe the same. They would need to see it with their own eyes, and by then it would be too late.”</p>
<p>“That’s possible,” Kiley said.</p>
<p>“I’ve laid out what the people in charge believe. I can report your feelings on this and come back another day, but I don’t think this is liable to change. They want security, you want supply.”</p>
<p>“Succinctly put,” Jeanne said.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you would need, if we were to extend good faith and renew supply for your construction.”</p>
<p>“Construction is stalled. Transportation is stalling. Crime is surging,” Nieves said.</p>
<p>“Which are things we’ll get a handle on,” Jeanne said, tersely. “Yes, please, let’s talk supply. Concrete, lumber, and food, to start with.”</p>
<p>“Let me see, paperwork, papers, thank you, Charles.”</p>
<p>The discussion continued.</p>
<p>Crystalclear held his tongue, but he could see the way the constructions around the other parahumans’ heads were operating, the cracks that were forming and gathering, and the bleeding of the colors. Blue-green tints, for many.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“They’ve been giving us supply for nothing?” Nieves asked, raising his voice. “You <em>idiots</em>. You’ve profited off of their so-called generosity, but you’ve been selling us out.”</p>
<p>“They were going to look for a foothold, whatever we did,” Jeanne said. “They wanted security, and that wouldn’t change whatever we did. Allowing them to help provided some of that security.”</p>
<p>“It provided them leverage and the impression they have a say in how Gimel is run!”</p>
<p>“They do have a say. They’re our neighbors, and they outnumber us,” Kiley said. She sounded tired.</p>
<p>The theocrats had departed. The people had changed seats, to sit closer together. Jackets had been removed and hung on the backs of chairs, waters and coffees obtained. The discussion continued, on a different front. A scattered, small group of people trying to find a way forward against a very large, united group.</p>
<p>The argument continued, heated, terse. Standing around the edges of the room, the parahumans exchanged looks, then walked over to where the coffee and water was being supplied.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Weld asked. Narwhal stood beside him.</p>
<p>“Jeanne has been in contact with Cheit for a long time,” Relay said. “Since Gold Morning?”</p>
<p>“Her assistant is a parahuman,” Crystalclear said. “Something about the way his head is put together. Thinker. They may have been communicating, maybe not.”</p>
<p>“Kiley was communicating with people throughout. Earpiece,” Relay said. “You didn’t see?”</p>
<p>“Heads and surrounding objects get murky,” Crystalclear said, his voice quiet.</p>
<p>“We asked you two here for a reason,” Narwhal said. “You have strong backgrounds, and people see you as trustworthy.”</p>
<p>“Foresight is taking on a role as Wardens adjunct,” Weld said. “A… discreet role.”</p>
<p>“You want us to be your watchdogs,” Crystalclear said.</p>
<p>“They’re keeping too close an eye on the Wardens themselves. We could use observers and more covert operatives.”</p>
<p>“Watching <em>them</em>?” Crystalclear asked, tilting his head toward the window. He tilted his head toward the table. “Or watching them?”</p>
<p>“That you asked proves we were right to ask,” Weld said.</p>
<p>Crystalclear bit his tongue. His instinct was to say Weld was wrong. That he was the wrong person. He missed critical things, by consequence of his power being what it was.</p>
<p>He’d joined the NNH to change things, to be a real piece in something greater, rather than a cog in the machine, and that had fallen to pieces.</p>
<p>But by saying all of that that, he would be relegating himself to Big Picture’s small-picture view of the world. Subsisting, looking after refugees, doing small things, instead of what he’d hoped for with the NNH. He would be saying he didn’t have what it took.</p>
<p>“I’m in,” Relay said. “But you already guessed that.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Narwhal said. “Crystalclear?”</p>
<p>Crystalclear nodded. “I will. One question, though.”</p>
<p>“Ask.”</p>
<p>“If you have us doing this, what do you have Advance Guard and the Attendant doing?”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap27">Glare &mdash; 3.1</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Cities, like people, got their second chances. Few cities had needed one so badly as this. I was left hoping the other cities were doing better with their second opportunities, because nothing I was seeing was very promising, here.</p>
<p>The four teams under the Wardens’ umbrella, now condensed down to three, were divided into those who wanted to return to the way things had been and those who wanted to forge a new way forward, learning from the mistakes of the past. The appeal of returning to a semblance of what we’d had was clear&mdash; we missed the foods, the places, the familiar businesses and media, the familiar faces.</p>
<p>We wanted normal and even now every meal, every soap we used, every piece of clothing, it was a reminder of how far from normal we were. It was different and often <em>less</em> because we had less, and we had less of a footing. I wasn’t the only person who felt their stomach sink when we saw the news two weeks after the broken trigger had decimated the reconstruction workers’ protest, saying that the transportation strike was imminent, and that factory workers were contemplating joining in, an across-the-board attempt to demand stability and structure.</p>
<p>It was <em>important</em>, a line had to be drawn and the endless talks about what our government would look like needed to end, but I still saw the reports and I knew the foods, clothes, and routine I wanted were going to have to wait that much longer.</p>
<p>That was one of the prevailing arguments for normal, for going back. This section of the city, this <em>settlement,</em> was the counterpoint.</p>
<p>Brockton Bay had been a port, growing as the industry did. A lot of what made it work as a fledgling port city made New Brockton work as one of our first footholds in Earth Gimel. Lumber, quarrying, some surface level minerals, and geography protected from the harshest sweeps of cold weather from the north.</p>
<p>The industry had become a prominent part of the city, and then the greater industry had outgrown it. Things had reached the point where it was easier to take one big ship and go to Boston and transport goods from there than to take two smaller ships and go to Brockton Bay, even if Brockton Bay was closer to the goods’ destination. The factories and goods went where the ships went, because it wasn’t sensible to ship raw materials from Boston to Brockton Bay to do manufacturing when Boston could handle it.</p>
<p>New Brockton felt like it sat on that brink between relevance and ruin. As a settlement, it was defined by tall buildings and the edifices of heavy industry. There were ships finding their way past each other on the water and big brick buildings with black plumes of smoke rising from their chimneys. Already back to the ways of an era that predated me, cutting corners to produce <em>more</em> at a cost to tomorrow. It was crowded and bursting at the seams, and it had been for a while now, trying to grow despite the constraints of water and mountain around it.</p>
<p>It didn’t escape me that the settlement continued to chug along while the gears and belts of the greater megalopolis were grinding to a stop under strikes and shutdowns.</p>
<p>I walked, rather than fly, because the directions I’d been given mandated it. I suspected it was intentional. I knew there were eyes on me, I knew who some of those eyes belonged to, and I had strong suspicions about others.</p>
<p>The racist graffiti no longer dominated downtown, though I did see some, with half of it partially painted over or altered. Many of the people who had lived and thrived in Brockton Bay had made their way here, after all. An attempt had been made to use wall space, to give the tenements-and-factories color when mirrored windows on skycrapers didn’t steal it from the sky or water. Murals now decorated many of the walls and building fronts, no doubt an attempt to leave less open wall space for the gang tags and symbols. Animals and symbols of humanity like clasped hands covered residential areas. Green trees, branches, and lush mountains painted almost ironically on the sides of factories and power plants.</p>
<p>There were places that mirrored home, in layout and the buildings that had been placed. The area that had been the Towers at the southwest corner of the city was still the Towers. Downtown was still where Downtown had been. A Lord Street stabbed north-to-south through the settlement. Despite the attempts, it wasn’t home. It came from something different.</p>
<p>Such was the counterpoint: in attempting to paint a picture of home, we might distort or create a caricature of that picture. If we rushed it or forced it, we risked making some of the same fundamental mistakes we’d made before, building on cracked foundations.</p>
<p>Seeing the murals, the directions I’d received started to make sense. The path was byzantine. <em>Go the way the wolf and his cubs are looking.</em>  A wolf and three cubs that looked like they were made of white smoke were painted on a concrete wall. They stood facing one way, but their heads were looking back.</p>
<p><em>Walk beneath the leaping rabbit.</em>  A rabbit decorated an arch at the edge of a children’s park. The park felt small and lonely amid larger, taller buildings, partially fenced in, with room for two swings, a slide, a sandbox and one basketball half-court that would have to be vacated if a car came through to use the parking garage or if the dump truck came for the dumpster at the back of a building.</p>
<p><em>Follow the snake</em>.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t known it was a snake, I might not have realized what it was. It was sectioned off, the skeleton of a winding serpent with each vertebrae several feet from the other. Three white pieces along one wall, a white-painted drain cover, then more segments on the wall opposite.</p>
<p>The painted lines of a crosswalk took me across the street. I followed more segments of the snake to reach one of the larger apartment complexes, four identical L-shaped buildings framing a plaza. The bottom floors of the buildings and the lowest floors along the inside of each ‘L’ had some basic stores.</p>
<p>Two years ago, this would have been one of the nicer areas in Earth Gimel, if a little basic. No-name grocery store, clothing store, and home-goods store. It was dated already, and I could already imagine two years from now, when various murals might be faded or defaced, when the metal chairs and tables would be rusted, the stores closed or forgotten. The snake cut through the plaza, which could have seated two hundred people, but currently had six. Any earlier and there would have been people having a late lunch. Any later and it would be time for an early dinner or an after-work bite to eat.</p>
<p>A tunnel led through the body of one of the apartment buildings, leading from plaza to parking lot. The mural of a cat with its back twisting and arching was painted on the walls and roof. Its paws stuck out and across the footpath firmly pressed down on the snake’s neck.</p>
<p><em>‘Wait’</em> was the last instruction.</p>
<p>I checked my phone. One message:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>K:</strong><br>
K.</p>
<p>I flicked my thumb, spun up the music player and then fished my earbuds out of the pocket of my jacket. I put only one in, so I could keep one ear out for trouble.</p>
<p>I waited long enough for five songs to start and stop. A pair of people arrived at the plaza, got their food, ate, and left, before anything happened. I wondered more than once if I’d been baited to come here as a way of making me waste time.</p>
<p>“You get fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>I turned my head in the direction of the parking lot, turning off my music and pulling the ear-bud free. I moved my hand in a circle to catch most of the length of cord in a loop.</p>
<p>Tattletale had reversed her costume colors from black on lavender to a more royal purple on black. The same pattern of lines slashing across her costume remained&mdash; horizontal line across the upper chest, vertical line slashing down from that, to form a stylized ‘T’. Another horizontal line jutted out from halfway down, followed by another vertical line piercing that line, a smaller ‘t’ nestled under the right arm of its big brother. She wasn’t the type to get photographed or caught clearly on video, and it was painted in such broad strokes that I suspected many people missed it.</p>
<p>It kind of smacked of narcissism, I felt, to wear one’s initials. The more black costume, at least, looked more distinguished. Her hair needed a bit of combing, like it had been tousled by the wind and it hadn’t been fixed.</p>
<p>She was followed by a flurry of small birds that settled on the street by the exit of the alley, and by one bodyguard. The cape was burly, wearing a skintight suit that showed off his muscles, and wore a heavy cloth hood with eyeholes cut out, a series of ‘x’ stitches forming a frowny-face. The lines around his eyes were cut deep. Very weary. He stood with his hands clasped behind him.</p>
<p>On the other side of the tunnel, one of the men that had been eating in the plaza had approached. He now stood with his back ramrod straight, his hands clasped behind him. Very clean cut, hair short and styled, recently shaved, t-shirt, black slacks, and shiny black shoes.</p>
<p>I knew Tattletale knew how my forcefield worked. If the man had a gun, he was potentially a danger to me.</p>
<p>“I like the cat,” I said, pointing. “Subtle.”</p>
<p>“Fifteen minutes, Vicky,” Tattletale said. “It’s going to be a lot less if you want to make small talk. If this becomes you wagging your finger at me and acting all holier-than-thou, I’m walking. I’m busy these days. The only reason I’m giving you time out of my day is hometown respect.”</p>
<p>I fished in my pocket. I pulled out the paper. “This isn’t because you wanted to talk to me?”</p>
<p>“When you’re positioned like I am, you can’t ever do one thing. That message was intended to do a few things at once.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help but notice your use of ‘Glory Hole’. Seemed unnecessarily antagonistic.”</p>
<p>She leaned against the wall by the cat’s head and smiled at me. “One, <em>I’m</em> unnecessarily antagonistic. Two, it serves to let you know who the letter is from, it pushes you off balance if you’re in a position to be easily put off balance, which I would want to know about, and finally, three, if the messenger is the type to ignore my instructions, read the letter and try using that phrasing against you, then they’re liable to get hurt. That makes it clear I’m to be listened to. Cleat isn’t the brightest, and he could stand to learn that lesson.”</p>
<p>“And you wanting to talk to me wasn’t one of your reasons?”</p>
<p>“That’s something else entirely. I offered Hollow Point three asks at a significant discount. Three times they can reach out to me and get info, now that they’ve paid. I did this to get them into my debt, to see if they were intelligent enough to ask good questions, and to get them used to paying me money for intel. If that tide somehow rises, I want my fortunes to rise with it. You turned up, and they wanted to know, were you the first of a larger group of heroes who were going to make a move? Who were you, and what role did you play?”</p>
<p>“And your response was this?”</p>
<p>“Multiple purposes, Vicky. Keep up. If you don’t care enough you decide it’s not worth it and leave. Unlikely. You could get a little upset, and in the doing you reveal what you’re up to. Or you’re invested on some level, and you reach out, and the dialogue is opened. If the dialogue is opened, I’m better equipped to deal with you and to deal with Hollow Point. How the dialogue is opened tells me a lot, too. You could have come charging after me. You didn’t. You asked around for how to contact me, used a liaison, and you respected my direction and my rules in my part of the city.”</p>
<p><em>My part of the city,</em> I thought. Yeah. Impressions verified &mdash; New Brockton had retained many of the problems of its predecessor.</p>
<p>“Cedar Point isn’t yours?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “We’ll see what it ends up being. For now, you’ve got people of Cleat’s caliber there.”</p>
<p>“I asked around a bit before leaving.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“The construction work dried up, people are moving elsewhere. Nothing was drawing people in. Then, in the span of a few days, a large number of people buy apartments, homes, and other properties. Never mind the fact that there isn’t a lot going on there. Now a lot of supervillains are making themselves comfortable, figuring out who’ll work with them and who won’t. Some places and people might be open to them doing business, others are already feeling the pressure to leave, scary people hanging around and intimidating them. People of Cleat’s caliber, maybe, but an awful lot of them.”</p>
<p>“It’s not the only place. It’s the biggest of them,” Tattletale said. “All the itinerant and teamless villains needed to settle somewhere eventually. Hollow Point is just loose enough they won’t necessarily kill each other, but self preservation keeps them together and following some basic rules. Some charisma here and there steers them.”</p>
<p>“New Brockton doesn’t count?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Different thing. Hollow Point is the largest place without a major player heading things. So far. New Brockton obviously has its major players securely in place.”</p>
<p>“And even though that neighborhood isn’t yours and isn’t even close to yours, you want me gone?”</p>
<p>“No,” she said. “<em>You</em> want you gone, if you know what’s good for you. You don’t want to get involved with that. You might make headway, but it won’t last. You’re outnumbered, they’ve got better resources, and if you ever succeed to any measurable degree, they can do things like call in the second of the asks they bought from me. Then they get an answer, and you have a bad day.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. I glanced back. The man standing at the edge of the plaza hadn’t budged. The brute with the bag over his head hadn’t either.</p>
<p>“If it’s not me they ask, then it’s someone else, and you potentially have an even worse day. I know you hate my guts, but the reality is I’m one of the <em>nice</em> ones.”</p>
<p>There were a lot of responses I could give to that. I bit my tongue.</p>
<p>I released my tongue and said, “Hypothetically, if you don’t mind hypotheticals…”</p>
<p>“I’m a great fan of the hypothetical.”</p>
<p>“…If I asked you where you suggested going, if Cedar Point isn’t workable or if it’s untouchable because someone like you is going to step in before any heroes make headway… what places would you suggest? Outside of the established jurisdictions for teams.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t suggest anything. It’s a wild west out there and there’s no place for you out there. Not anymore.”</p>
<p>I folded my arms. I’d expected an answer like this.</p>
<p>“The people who win are the people with clout. While you were teaching school kids which direction a gun should point or hauling water out to the refugees still back on Bet, the rest of us were working. I and people like me were getting our hooks in and laying groundwork to build something behind the scenes. Taking over corner worlds, finding footholds in this world, starting up businesses, establishing reputations. The big hero teams have some influence because they’ve been recruiting and they staked out their territory. Hero and villain, we’re the major players, but we operate the same fundamental way. We’re scary. The thinkers, the masters, the masterminds, and the people with the biggest guns.”</p>
<p>“And Cedar Point?”</p>
<p>“Cedar Point, if you want to call it that, and its sister locations are late to the game. They have some clout because they have numbers and a bit of organization, and because they can all scrape together enough money to call in a big gun if they really truly need it. They probably won’t last. Someone nasty will step in and take over what they’re trying to build and it’s probably going to be ugly. The only reason they’ve lasted this long is that the rest of us have bigger fish to fry. They’re still a few rungs up the totem pole above<em> you</em>, mind you.”</p>
<p>“It’s too hard so it’s not worth trying?”</p>
<p>“Go home, Vicky,” she said, almost sighing the words. “Go back, figure out your family thing, keep trying to sign on to one of the big hero teams, you’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually. Some cape will die in battle, and a seat will open up for you and you’ll do fine. Or retire. After what your sister did to you, nobody would blame you.”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>“Do what any self-respecting twenty-one year old would do after failing to get into university, get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches. Talk to your kids about the old Glory days.”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. “And what happens to Cedar Point, in this hypothetical?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking reality, Vicky. It’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up, and it’s the same thing that’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there. The area struggles, it withers, it becomes irrelevant. This isn’t your fight, and it’s not what you’re equipped to do. You hit things. You can take a bullet, unless you’re doing something peculiar like keeping your forcefield down while standing between a man with a gun and Snuff here.”</p>
<p>“Heya,” Snuff said, raising a hand.</p>
<p>I didn’t move a muscle, didn’t react. Tattletale smiled.</p>
<p>“I <em>know</em> what you’re doing with your forcefield, Vicky. Just like I did back then. I know why you’re doing it, too. I know you don’t belong in Cedar Point, and I know you’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything. It’s not your skillset, it’s not your powerset.”</p>
<p>I still had the paper in my hand. I tapped it against my upper arm, my arms still folded. “Four years, and you haven’t changed a bit since you raided that bank.”</p>
<p>“When we robbed that bank, I was doing multiple things all at once, laying groundwork for moves I wouldn’t make for weeks and months. If I haven’t changed from that, I think I’m doing okay,” she said.</p>
<p>“Are you, though?” I asked. “Your hair is messy, and you look tired.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to pretend you’re actually asking out of a concern for my well being, because if I didn’t pretend, I’d walk away, and I might even give some free-of-charge advice to those Hollow Point ruffians, telling them how to beat you if they run into you.”</p>
<p>“Entirely out of concern for your well being,” I said, with as little warmth and concern in my voice as I could muster. “Hometown respect, you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m one of the major players now. The other major players call me for a hint when they’re stuck on something. I’m wealthy, well-positioned, and safe. I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way. It’s part of why I’m having this conversation with you.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. I paused. “Speaking of you showing up, I’m surprised the rest of your old team didn’t turn up too, for old time or camaraderie’s sake.”</p>
<p>She turned. With the way the light came through the tunnel, I could see the eye symbol on her chest in a slightly different shade of purple, hidden where the vertical bar met the horizontal, and the shadows meant I could no longer see her eyes or expression. Maintaining the same tone, she said, “No, you’re not surprised. You know full well they’re well positioned too. They’re doing their own things. They’re still a resource I can and will tap.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha,” I said.</p>
<p>“But I think you were trying to get a jab in, and that’s a good sign this conversation has run its course. I’ll wish you good luck in your endeavors, whether you join a big team or end up making those sandwiches. So long as you stay out of my way.”</p>
<p>“Out of curiosity,” I said. I saw her pause, just as she was about to turn to walk away. I continued, “Do you regret your part in what happened with my sister?”</p>
<p>“Do you?” she asked, without missing a beat.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” I said, without any more hesitation than she’d shown.</p>
<p>“Be sure to call before you set foot in my neighborhood again. You and your friend have a nice flight home.”</p>
<p><em>Friend?</em> My first thought was that she meant my autonomous forcefield, that she was personifying it.</p>
<p>Then I realized who she really meant. Just as surprising that she would be aware, but not as alarming.</p>
<p>She hadn’t answered my question, but I hadn’t expected an answer. She and Snuff walked to the parking lot, turning the corner there. Behind me, the gunman was walking back to his table.</p>
<p>My impression was that I was better off heading the way I’d come than I was leaving.</p>
<p>The moment I didn’t have the roof of the tunnel over my head, I took to the air.</p>
<p>I was high enough that I could see the entirety of Tattletale’s realm, and where the city was bleeding into and through the mountains and forest to connect to other areas and the remainder of the megalopolis. I could see the boats on the water, like ants on an anthill, the black smoke, and the patches that gleamed with a forced luster.</p>
<p>It wasn’t home. The worst of the fucking racists were gone, I had to hope, but the rest of the bad stuff seemed to be firmly entrenched in there.</p>
<p>I drew my phone from my pocket. I put the one earbud in, some music to drown out my thoughts while I steadied myself.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Me:</strong><br>
Did you record all of that?</p>
<p>A dark shape flew within a foot of me. For an instant, I thought it might have been one of the small birds that had arrived with Tattletale.</p>
<p>It was a sphere, consisting of several layers like an onion, alternating blue and red. The lens was a white circle, and as it roved, the layers moved to accommodate it looking around. Several fins extended out from the two most external layers, moving independently of one another to correct its position and hold eerily steady in the wind.</p>
<p>“<em>Recorded it all,</em>” the camera said, Kenzie’s voice with some synthesizer mixing things up.</p>
<p>“You got the sound, too?”</p>
<p><em>“Of course,”</em> she said. “<em>Can I listen to it?</em>”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “Not yet. Not when Tattletale operates the way she does. I’ve got a long flight back. Any way you can replay the conversation for me so I can listen to it on the way back, and figure out if anything needs redacting?”</p>
<p>“<em>Without listening in?</em>”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer if you listened in with the rest of the group. I’m concerned Tattletale can say something to me that affects one of you. She touched on some personal subjects, and I need to think about how much I’m comfortable sharing.”</p>
<p>“<em>Not a problem. Give me a minute.</em>”</p>
<p>I started my flight home, the camera flying alongside me.</p>
<p>I expected the camera to speak, when Kenzie was ready. I was a little surprised when it came through my ear-bud instead.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p><em>“…you’re bound to find a position somewhere eventually. Some cape will die in battle, and a seat will open up for you and you’ll do fine. Or retire. After what your sister did to you, nobody would blame you.”</em></p>
<p>I was still, listening to this. The others, Rain excepted, were gathered around the table. The library had picnic tables and benches strewn around, and some patio chairs for reading outdoors when the weather was good. They had arranged themselves on a mixture of seats, with Ashley standing. Kenzie’s laptop was sitting on a patio table, with Rain watching in through a halting, low-res webcam.</p>
<p>I’d been periodically pausing the conversation, to fill in gaps with basic knowledge and context, but I left things alone for this one.</p>
<p><em>“Do what any self-respecting twenty-one year old would do after failing to get into university, get a job waitressing or making hero sandwiches. Talk to your kids about the old Glory days.”</em></p>
<p>“Pause,” I said.</p>
<p>The recording paused.</p>
<p>“It took her a little while to get around to it, but it’s worth stressing that this is who she is. I thought about redacting these parts, but I think it’s important you know. The PRT thought she had the ability to sense weak points, primarily psychological ones. I agree with that assessment.”</p>
<p>“Your sister is Panacea, right?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>I tensed a bit.</p>
<p>“Chris,” Sveta said. “I think Victoria would prefer it if we glossed over that part.”</p>
<p>“It’s for context. Like she just said, it stresses who Tattletale is.”</p>
<p>“She was a healer,” I said. “Tattletale’s words caught her in a bad way at a bad time. Two months later, she had a mental breakdown. In part because of what Tattletale said. She put me in the hospital. Let’s leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“Resume recording,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“<em>And what happens to Cedar Point, in this hypothetical?</em>”</p>
<p><em>“I’m talking reality, Vicky. It’s going to be the same thing that was going to happen before the villains turned up, and it’s the same thing that’s going to happen when and if you try and summarily fail to change things there.”</em></p>
<p>“Pause,” I said. “She likes to act like she knows what’s going to happen, but it’s worth saying she can be surprised. She was surprised at the bank. She and her team pulled it off regardless, but… she was surprised by my arrival, and by my sister being there.”</p>
<p>“Worth keeping in mind,” Tristan said. “If we wind up fighting her.”</p>
<p>“I’m giving you all the info I can, so you can make an informed decision,” I said. “Resume.”</p>
<p>“<em>-The area struggles, it withers, it becomes irrelevant. This isn’t your fight, and it’s not what you’re equipped to do. You hit things. You&mdash;</em>”</p>
<p>Kenzie’s voice chimed in with a cheerful, synthesized, “<em>Redacted!</em>”</p>
<p>“Pause. Redacted because it’s a weak point,” I said. “Power-related.”</p>
<p>“I think I know,” Sveta said. “If this makes you doubt Victoria at all, I hope me vouching for her helps.”</p>
<p>“It helps,” Kenzie said. “Not that I was doubting her.”</p>
<p>“Resume,” I said.</p>
<p>“<em>-I know you don’t belong in Cedar Point, and I know you’re just going to cause headaches for me and the actual heroes if you try anything. It’s not your skillset, it’s not your powerset.</em>”</p>
<p>There was a small chime as a message appeared in the corner of the laptop. The recording paused in response to the message appearing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Rain:</strong>  Is it ours?</p>
<p>“That’s a conversation I want to have shortly,” I said. “Powers.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to this,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Behind him, pacing a little, Ashley smiled.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>“Resume,” I said.</p>
<p><em>“Redacted, redacted,”</em> Kenzie’s synthesized voice played. Then Tattletale’s voice came up again. “<em>I’m one of the major players now. The other major players call me for a hint when they’re stuck on something. I’m wealthy, well-positioned, and safe. I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way. It’s part of why I’m having this conversation with you.</em>”</p>
<p>“Stop,” I said. The recording paused, and Kenzie hit a keyboard shortcut to close the window. “Everything that followed was small talk, some threats from her, and stuff about my sister I don’t want to get into. That’s Tattletale. That’s how she sees the world. I do believe her when she says there’s no good way to break into this scene. There are a lot of people who want to hold their positions and the power they’ve taken for themselves, and when you’ve cornered them, they’re going to call people like Tattletale for backup.”</p>
<p>“Or worse,” Ashley said. That was apparently what she’d fixated on, during the earlier part of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Or worse. People who are good at the roles they’ve taken on, well-proven by years of experience, people who can and will casually destroy you.”</p>
<p>“No matter what we do,” Sveta said, “We’re going to run into trouble. So we do nothing or we plan for it.”</p>
<p>“We plan for it,” Tristan said. “Ashley and I were talking about this. Something that might fit our niche, and gives key members of our team what they’re looking for.”</p>
<p>He looked at Kenzie as he said the last bit, and Kenzie visibly perked up.</p>
<p>“You have a game plan?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The start of one,” Tristan said. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>I thought about that for a moment. The others exchanged a few words, and a chime signaled Rain’s comment for the convo &mdash; he and Tristan had apparently exchanged some messages about the plan.</p>
<p>“Did you guys bring costume stuff?” I asked, when there was an opening. “Those of you that have it?”</p>
<p>That got me confirmation from about half of the group.</p>
<p>“I have spare, basic masks for those that need them,” I said. “I also have the start of my team outline written up on my laptop. What do you guys say we move to an area with some elbow room, you can show me enough of your powers that I know what to put in the document, and we talk about what you’ve got in mind?”</p>
<p>It might as well have been a rhetorical question. None of them were about to say no to that.</p>

<p>“Hey, Victoria, you’re strong right?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” I said. “I’d be worried about breaking whatever it is I’m handling.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty durable.”</p>
<p>I thought about my forcefield. “I totaled the last car I lifted.”</p>
<p>“I brought things, and I thought maybe Chris could lift some or Tristan could, but Tristan doesn’t think he’s strong enough and Chris doesn’t want to.”</p>
<p>She turned stick out her tongue at Chris.</p>
<p>“Limited duration,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I can take a look, where is this?” I asked Kenzie.</p>
<p>“At the street. Black van. I’ll show you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’d help. I’ll probably have questions.”</p>
<p>I turned to the others, pointing at the treeline. “If you guys want to head over that way, stop at the rocky outcropping on the hill. We’ll meet you there.”</p>
<p>Kenzie walked with me. She was wearing black overalls and a pink tank top, a red apple clip in her hair, and red sneakers. Her hair was in much the same style as before, but the buns were set higher.</p>
<p>I paid more attention to her fashion choice because so much about it seemed deliberate, from color scheme to running theme. During the last meeting it had been a star on her dress, partially on her shirt, and in her hair.</p>
<p>“My dad gave me a ride today, because he needs to buy a suit and more work clothes,” Kenzie said. “Please don’t judge me too harshly if he acts really lame.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” I said. “You said Tristan and Chris could have helped. Tristan has increased strength?”</p>
<p>“Just a little. Very very little.”</p>
<p>“I guess we’ll find out soon.”</p>
<p>“Sveta could have helped too, we think, she’s really strong if she uses her real body, but it would have meant dragging it and that would have hurt the grass.”</p>
<p>“How big is this thing?”</p>
<p>“I’ll show you,” she said. She sprinted the last little way to the sleek van that was parked on the street in front of the library, hopping up to the passenger side window, clinging to the bottom edge of the open window so she could stick her head in. The back door of the van popped open, and Kenzie’s father stepped out, walking around the van to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>He was almost as meticulous in appearance as Kenzie. He was very lean, with pronounced cheekbones and a long face that was made to look longer by the goatee that extended an inch from his chin. He wore a short-sleeved work shirt with a pinstripe pattern on it, and slim jeans that looked like they had cost a pretty penny. Shoes, belt, and watch, all expensive-looking.</p>
<p>The beard and his longer hair weren’t as tidy as Kenzie was, but I was hardly about to judge, given how it was probably a day off for him and he was sitting in the sun.</p>
<p>“Dad, this is Victoria. She’s the coach I was talking about. Victoria, this is my dad.”</p>
<p>“Hi, Mr…” I extended a hand.</p>
<p>“Julien Martin,” he said. He shook my hand. Both handshake and his tone were stiff, but it was a different kind of stiffness than I was used to seeing in Dean’s family. I was well aware of how easily I’d slotted him onto that same mental shelf.</p>
<p>“You can call him Julien,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. What do you do?”</p>
<p>“Realty.”</p>
<p>“Dad only got into realty a year and a half ago, but he’s really good at both the buying and selling sides of things. I don’t really get it all, but his boss seemed pretty happy with him. You got a promotion, right?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“He’s doing it ethically, too, which is so important, with so many shady people out there.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying,” he said.</p>
<p>“I can respect that,” I said. “Thanks for bringing Kenzie out this far, and for bringing her stuff.”</p>
<p>Kenzie rolled her eyes. “We should go take a look so we don’t keep the others waiting.”</p>
<p>Julien followed us around to the back of the van, standing back while we opened the doors. A black box that was a bit larger than a washing machine was sitting in there, strapped down ten ways from Sunday, to keep it from sliding around when the vehicle moved. More boxes were sitting at either side of the van, with straps to keep them flush against the wall, but they weren’t any larger than a backpack or suitcase.</p>
<p>“We got the van because some of my stuff is hard to move,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. The box had a metal frame around the edges, with a crossbar running diagonally along each face. “What do I need to know?”</p>
<p>“Pick it up and move it.”</p>
<p>“It’s tinkertech, right?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“Is there a chance of a misfire if it’s moved in the wrong way, if something’s crushed or broken?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Will I hurt anything if it’s turned on its side?”</p>
<p>“No,” Kenzie said. “Hm. It’s best if you don’t turn it upside down.”</p>
<p>“Where should I grab it, to best carry it?”</p>
<p>“Geeez,” Kenzie said. “It’s not going to blow up or anything. Or if it did, it wouldn’t be a big enough explosion to hurt anyone. Not unless very specific conditions were met.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said. I had an issue with my power, where I wasn’t sure I trusted the forcefield to simply hold the box and not crush or dig into it. It was only about a minute of flying to get to where I wanted to go, but even if everything went according to plan, I was worried that handling the box for more than a couple of seconds would leave handprints or gouges in it.</p>
<p>While I investigated, Kenzie climbed in beside me, peering at the box and watching me.</p>
<p>“Give me some space?” I asked.</p>
<p>Kenzie grabbed some smaller things on her way out.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes, but I unclipped the straps that were securing the box in place, and laid them across the ground. I lifted the box, and set it down on the straps. I connected them, wrapping them around the box, then slid it around so I could reach the ones at the back. There was a ramp built into the truck, and I could see where the box could slide along the tracks, but it seemed like more of a hassle to use the ramp and unload that way.</p>
<p>“How dangerous is this team business going to be?” Julien asked, behind me.</p>
<p>“Dad,” Kenzie protested. “Don’t embarrass me.”</p>
<p>“If I thought it was going to be a serious danger, I wouldn’t be helping,” I said, still working on the straps. “But I can’t guarantee anything.”</p>
<p>I fastened the straps, then hauled the entire thing out, forcefield up, gripping the box. It thudded against the street. Dense.</p>
<p>“Is it a problem?” I asked Julien.</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem,” Kenzie said, firm. “I can handle myself. I’ve trained more than a lot of heroes, because I did a year going to all the practice events and stuff.”</p>
<p>“I’m more interested in what your dad has to say. I don’t want to step on toes, and your parents get the last word.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” Julien said. “If it wasn’t this, she would be doing something else. I prefer this team idea.”</p>
<p>“You should,” Kenzie huffed.</p>
<p>“Do you need to be picked up?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. In…?” Kenzie looked at me.</p>
<p>“Two hours?” I asked. “Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” her dad said. He still had that tone, which came across curt, inflexible. I had a hard time imagining him as a salesman. Accountant, maybe.</p>
<p>“Before you do anything, can you go to the train station? Rain had to take the train and he’s running late. Bring him here?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>Her dad frowned.</p>
<p>“Please,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Where am I going?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Give me your phone, I’ll put it in there.”</p>
<p>While they fussed, I checked and fixed the remainder of the straps.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back,” I said.</p>
<p>The straps served to let me hold the box without actually holding it. I flew, holding the length of straps that I’d wound together and attached at the tail end. The box made for unwieldy flying, swinging below me.</p>
<p>Could the forcefield potentially claw through them? Yes. I hoped I’d be able to see it before it managed to succeed.</p>
<p>I flew in the direction I’d sent the others, leaving Kenzie behind.</p>
<p>My phantom self gripped the length of straps, scratched, squeezed, and twisted it, periodically making the ten foot length of cords bend in unusual shapes.</p>
<p>I hadn’t interacted with it much. I hadn’t seen the limits of its intelligence or lack thereof. This one minute of flying might have even been the longest period I’d properly used my strength in two years.</p>
<p>I sighted the others, sitting on the rocks and talking. I dropped low, and I set the box down on the ground. Even with the care I was taking, it made a noise on landing.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Tristan said. “How heavy is that thing?”</p>
<p>“No idea,” I said. “If I had to guess, maybe three hundred and fifty pounds?”</p>
<p>“I can see why she has a hard time moving those things around.”</p>
<p>“She described them as being bigger,” Chris said. “Others, I think. I think they start at that size and get larger.”</p>
<p>“Did her dad leave?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” I said. “They’re figuring out logistics. He’s going to go pick up Rain at the station. Be right back.”</p>
<p>I flew over to where Kenzie and her dad were. Kenzie’s dad was in the driver’s seat, and Kenzie was closing the rear doors. A series of bags and boxes were unloaded, all packed together.</p>
<p>As I landed, her dad pulled away. Kenzie raised a hand in a wave.</p>
<p>I was aware of the lack of a wave in response. From the way she lowered her hand and glanced at me, Kenzie was too.</p>
<p>“Want to fly over?” I asked.</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up with excitement as she nodded.</p>
<p>There were very few people in the world who didn’t like flying.</p>
<p>It was, in a way, almost as much of a pain to bring Kenzie, two cases and two boxes without my strength active, as it had been to move the one cube. I ended up lifting her by the straps at the back of her overalls, my hand also wrapped around the strap of one bag, while Kenzie held other things.</p>
<p>We arrived at the hill with the rocks. There was light overgrowth, a fairly loose distribution of trees for the fact that it was untamed wilderness, and thick grass. A surveying team had passed through at one point, and they had disturbed earth here and there, felled a few trees, and spray painted the face of one of the larger rocks before leaving.</p>
<p>A bit of a shame, but I could understand the need for a quick and easy label. No minerals or stone of any particular value here.</p>
<p>Chris, wearing his headphones again, was wearing what looked like the same shorts as he had worn at the meeting, and a different t-shirt. He was examining the box, while keeping at least two feet away from it at all times. He had a bag with him, a travelers’ backpack that was packed full, but he’d put it down.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to keep your distance,” Kenzie said. “It’s not dangerous.”</p>
<p>“It’s tinkertech. It’s science that gets at least some of its functionality from interdimensional fuckery, built by cooperation between you and the unfathomable, menacing <em>thing</em> that chose you as its host.”</p>
<p>“It’s a <em>camera</em>, Chris. It records and projects.”</p>
<p>“It’s a camera built with collaboration between you and a unknowable, violence-driven multiversal horror.”</p>
<p>“My multiversal horror is pretty tame, I think. She just likes to build things and gather information,” Kenzie pressed buttons on the side of the box. A triangle between reinforcing bars lit up.</p>
<p>A hologram appeared a number of feet away. A potbellied rat with a crooked nose.</p>
<p>“…And you’re using it to make cartoons,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Plump Rat King,” Sveta said. “Some of the kids at the hospital liked that one.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Kenzie said. “Only the first season was really any good.”</p>
<p>“What’s it good for?” Ashley asked. She was taking things a step further than Chris’ wearing of the same shorts. She wore the same dress she had worn at the meeting, the damage at the corner mended imperfectly. One of the straps, I realized, had been damaged and patched, but her hair masked much of it. She had a black mask in her hand, but she hadn’t put it on.</p>
<p>“Stuff. Loads of stuff. I’ll show you some later,” Kenzie said. She started opening boxes.</p>
<p>Tristan, much like Kenzie, was unpacking a bag. His costume was armor. It struck a balance between function and appearance, but it looked like it was a pretty good quality. Each segment was framed with goat’s heads and horns, spirals and ridges. Where it wasn’t brushed metal, things were painted or tinted red or light red. He saw me looking and smiled.</p>
<p>“Byron is the fish theme, then?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Water as much as fish. Yeah,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You have some kind of superstrength, right?”</p>
<p>“A very small amount. Helps when you’re wearing armor as heavy as this, or when you’re using a power that can make heavy things.”</p>
<p>“Seems like a good place to get us started,” I said.</p>
<p>Tristan turned around, seating himself firmly on the sloped ground, his armor partially unpacked and arranged beside him. Some bits were already fastened into place on his arms and legs, over a bodysuit that seemed designed to go between him and his armor.</p>
<p>He held up his hand, and produced three motes of orange-red light. As each one moved through the air, it left a trail behind it, like the afterimage of a sparkler waved through the darkness. They traced a circle and as the moving points of light connected to the end of each trail, a shape came to life. A discus, with a slight peak on one side.</p>
<p>I extended a hand, and he passed it to me.</p>
<p>Dense, heavy, very solid. Matter creation.</p>
<p>“You can throw it,” he said.</p>
<p>I threw it. It wasn’t as aerodynamic as a frisbee, but it did catch the air. It wobbled mid-flight and veered off course, crashing into a tree before disappearing into a patch of grass.</p>
<p>Tristan was already making something else. Twelve or more motes of light traced the shape. “Requires a bit of concentration, I can rush it or force it to come into being early, but you get weirdness like… this.”</p>
<p>It materialized. A hammer or a mace, long-handled. The weirdness was in how the shape finalized its form, drawing pretty creative curves and hooks. Spikes, horns, thorns, and other slightly curved growths stood out. It looked unbalanced.</p>
<p>“Are they permanent?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They can be. Depends if I keep the sparks alive or not. I can create a lot of sparks, but it requires more time, more concentration.”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference between keeping it alive or not?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ah,” he said. He pushed himself to his feet, shifting his footing to make sure he wouldn’t slide down the hill. He held out the mace, and started to form the motes for another. He rushed this one even more than he had the last. The shape was more unwieldy, less balanced. “Byron, you want to help with demonstrations today, or do you want to be left alone?”</p>
<p>Tristan blurred, features distorting, his eyes flaring with the same light as the sparks had. The light turned blue, and then he was Byron, wearing a hooded sweatshirt and jeans.</p>
<p>One of the two maces exploded into a spray of water. Sveta made a noise of surprise, and Chris, still mostly fixated on examining Kenzie’s cube, jumped back from the cube in surprise.</p>
<p>Byron turned his head so the backspray hit him in the side of the face, rather than right in the center of it. He dropped the still-intact mace he held with his other hand.</p>
<p>“Hi Byron,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I added my greeting to Kenzie’s. “We haven’t formally met.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t. I got the basics,” he said.</p>
<p>“So I gathered.”</p>
<p>“This is a terrible idea,” he said. “Tristan being involved, this team concept, the potential for disaster, and this thing with Tattletale?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see anyone changing their mind. Mrs. Yamada couldn’t convince them, I don’t think I can. If they’re going to do this or something like this, isn’t it better that they do it smart and informed?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “But if you’re enabling them, you should know you own a share of what happens.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s fair,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“It might be fair,” I said.</p>
<p>“My voice doesn’t matter either. I tried, nobody listens. Maybe I own a bit of what happens for not trying harder to stop Tristan from going forward with this.”</p>
<p>“You sound pretty certain something bad is going to happen.”</p>
<p>“I was there for all the therapy sessions, even if I didn’t participate,” he said. He looked at the others. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to say anything. But I am going to say, again, this is a trainwreck waiting to happen.”</p>
<p>“We got it,” Chris said. “Saying it over and over doesn’t change anything.”</p>
<p>“Be kind, Chris,” Sveta said. “There’s a lot playing into Byron’s concerns.”</p>
<p>Byron shook his head. He glanced at me.</p>
<p>“You need anything, while we’re talking?” I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No. Um. You seem alright, so… be safe. Be wary. And for the record, since you’re going to ask…”</p>
<p>He showed me his power. Motes of light, like Tristan’s, blue. He drew them in the air, two expanding, abstract shapes, not closed like Tristan’s had been. He positioned them so there was one on either side of him, then clenched his fist. The lines that were drawn became water, buckets worth, spraying out in the direction the lines had been drawn. He had drawn them out as expanding spirals, and the resulting water flew out in circular sprays.</p>
<p>“You can use me if you need to clean up, Tristan,” Byron said. “I’ll do the quick swaps if you need them.”</p>
<p>The water was still spraying when Byron blurred, features distorting and smearing together, the two lighted eyes peering through the shadows between folds and smears, going from blue to orange-red.</p>
<p>One of the sprays of water lost all of its oomph, the remaining water striking the ground to flow through grass and between rocks. The other diagram became a solid object, a wheel spikier and cruder than what Tristan had made. It hit the ground and stuck there.</p>
<p>The water that Byron’s power had produced rained down on us for several seconds.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to hurt the box?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Nope,” Kenzie said. “Waterproofed just in case Byron visited. It was good to see you, Byron, by the way. I hope to prove you wrong.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Sveta said. “That’s a good way of putting it, Kenzie.”</p>
<p>Tristan’s face was at an angle that saw him looking down at the ground. At first I thought he was trying to keep the water out of his face. Then, as he changed the angle of his head a little, I saw his face.</p>
<p>“For the record,” Tristan said, “If it’s my two hours and I ask you a question and then pass the baton, I’d <em>really</em> appreciate it if you didn’t take up extra time and use it to try and sabotage me.”</p>
<p>“I did say hi to him,” I said.</p>
<p>Tristan shrugged. “He didn’t have to say all that. He’s quick to say there’s a problem but he doesn’t suggest alternatives. He whines about the circumstances but he won’t attend the therapy and he doesn’t want to work on figuring out better courses of action. It pisses me off sometimes, especially when he elbows into my time to make what I’m trying to accomplish harder.”</p>
<p>His tone was hard. Pissed off seemed like an apt description. I’d seen Tristan, casual and smiling some before he’d changed, and now this felt like a complete, sudden shift.</p>
<p>It was easy to forget that he was in there while Byron was out here, feeling things, thinking, his mood changing during that short conversation.</p>
<p>I could see the expressions of others. The sympathy on Sveta’s face, the tilt of Chris’ head.</p>
<p>Ashley looked especially focused and attentive, her pacing around the hill having come to a stop. One of her hands was at her hair, pushing it back out of her face, the water helping it stay there.</p>
<p>“It seems like hard feelings are inevitable,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said. He looked away. “I can keep my shapes ‘alive’. If they’re still alive when I change, they become water. If they aren’t, they’re there to stay. Same for Byron’s water. It’s effective if he makes water, sloshes it over someone, and then changes, to make it solid. We’ve tagged a good dozen villains that way.”</p>
<p>“A dozen is a really good number for a teenage hero.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty lucky, getting a name that fitting for a power like that.”</p>
<p>“Constellations forming rock and water?” Tristan asked. He snorted air through his nostrils. “Want to know the hilarious thing?”</p>
<p>“I do,” I said. I wasn’t sure whatever he was going to say was ‘hilarious’, given his tone, but I’d <em>hoped</em> today would be a lighter endeavor, and any humor would help.</p>
<p>“We weren’t even rock and water, originally. Reach bought the name from the last Capricorn. She got wounded in battle and she retired. Win-win. We got settled into the role, got our name, our armor, our brand, and… power changed to match.”</p>
<p>“That’s really interesting,” I said. “There’s a lot of potential there.”</p>
<p>“There is. Absolutely. And not all of it’s good,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“But some of it is,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Some of it is, yeah,” Tristan said. He offered her a small smile.</p>
<p>I could see the concerted effort he was making to pull out of the funk. A few words from his brother and he was upset enough that it showed in his tone and the direction of what he was talking about.</p>
<p>Tricky, that kind of negativity sitting just under the surface.</p>
<p>“Sveta,” I said. Change of topic. “I’m guessing you’ve worked on control enough that you feel okay letting loose in limited ways?”</p>
<p>“Kind of,” she said. “I don’t want to go all-out in a combat situation. I don’t want to do anything that would risk people getting hurt.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“I figured I would mostly stay in the suit. I can do this…”</p>
<p>She didn’t touch or move anything external, but the joints of her elbow shifted, and the forearm and hand dropped. Ten or so tendrils extended between elbow and forearm, like a muscle with gaps between strands.</p>
<p>She moved it, tendrils bending, flinging her hand and the attached segment of arm out fifty feet. She tried to grab a branch, missed it, grabbed another, and seized it, before pulling her body to follow. I saw her turn her head away as she pulled herself through the intervening twigs and leaves.</p>
<p>She twisted around, pointed a hand, and used tendrils to push her fist out.</p>
<p>She seized the wheel that Byron had left embedded in the earth, and pulled herself to it.</p>
<p>There was a bit of gracelessness to the landing, her pants leg and the side of her body rubbing against the grass, a few clumps of earth flying, but it served to put her in our midst again. She wobbled as she stood and Tristan and I caught her between us.</p>
<p>She made a small ‘phew’ sound.</p>
<p>“You’re made of grappling hooks, basically,” Chris said. Kenzie, sitting on her box, stuck out her toe to jab Chris in the shoulder.</p>
<p>“I can get things for my body. Weld and I were talking about getting a second body for cape things. If I had hooks I could unfold I could more reliably grab things. And I’ll get better with practice,” Sveta said. “And I really want extra shielding for my joints because they’re the easiest part to break, and I don’t want to have to send it out to be repaired and be unable to walk or do things in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“What happens if the suit gets broken?” I asked. “As in broken enough that it doesn’t keep you contained?”</p>
<p>“Um. I have a collapsed hamster ball in here. I can spit it out, unfold it, shove myself in there and bring the lid behind me. It’s a bit cramped, it’s not the biggest, and it might not always work, but I’ve also been working hard at keeping myself under control.”</p>
<p>I suppressed a wince. Sveta had worked hard for as long as I’d known her, and I knew that the anxiety was tied into the lack of control in a feedback loop, and that her being so much more confident and happy would mean she had more control, but all it took was one bad incident.</p>
<p>“Workable,” I said. “We’d have to be really, <em>really</em> careful.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” she said, with dead seriousness. “The way I see it, my body is pretty hardy. To break containment, it would take something that would maim an ordinary person.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. <em>But if they think you’re durable, they might not hold back</em>.</p>
<p>We’d address that when it came to it.</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said. “So, my line of thinking was that instead of explaining, we’d do a little bit of a team exercise.”</p>
<p>I heard a faint groan from Chris.</p>
<p>“It should be fun, and it should be relatively low-key,” I said. “We split everyone into teams of three, and we play a small game of capture the flag, here.”</p>
<p>“See, that’s playing dirty,” Tristan said. “You’re playing into my love for competition, here.”</p>
<p>“It’s fun,” Kenzie said. “I really like this.”</p>
<p>It seemed Kenzie could be counted on to be positive. I said, “I’m hoping it’s fun. Does anyone else need to explain their powers or cover anything before we get into it? I know what Ashley can do, unless something’s changed.”</p>
<p>Ashley shook her head.</p>
<p>“We’ll see you in action when we have our competition, then. That leaves Chris and Kenzie, kind of.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got some things,” Kenzie said. She opened a case. “Two of these things I had as just-in-case things when I was a Ward. I got them fixed up recently, and I even made an improvement. Eye hook&mdash;”</p>
<p>She pulled out a coil of metal. She stuck it on the corner of her cube, then held her phone in one hand, moving her thumb around. The coil unfurled, prehensile, and its tip unfolded from its teardrop shape. Three claws, extending from around a circular lens with a pupil. Kenzie moved her head and body in time with the movements of the thing.</p>
<p>The thing moved closer to me, until it was two feet from my face, the three claw-blades opening and closing a little. It blinked at me, shutter closing momentarily.</p>
<p>“It was made to look through vents, to start with. it’s delicate enough it can turn screws and drill holes, and I can swap out the lens for others. And I’ve got this flash gun too.”</p>
<p>She held up something that looked like a child’s toy, squat, blunt, with a lens on the front.</p>
<p>“It’s for when I had to get closer to the scene when I was with the Baltimore Wards. They wanted me to be able to protect myself and they wanted nonlethal.”</p>
<p>“What does it do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Makes light,” she said. She aimed it off to the side and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>It looked and sounded like a camera flash going off.</p>
<p>“And the other stuff?”</p>
<p>“Mask with a few settings,” Kenzie said. She pulled out a high-tech mask, metal around the edges to give a general circular shape to the clear pane for her face, but she didn’t put it on. She held up a disc, then clipped it to the front of her overalls, so it was directly over the pocket at her chest. “This is kind of a costume thing I haven’t finalized.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. “Great.”</p>
<p>“I transform,” Chris said. “Changer.”</p>
<p>I made a motion for him to continue.</p>
<p>He sounded aggrieved, like it was my fault he had to explain at all, “I don’t know what else you want. I have a few different forms. They’re inspired by my moods and mental states.”</p>
<p>“You give them names based on what mood or state they’re from,” Kenzie said. “Like Creeping Anxiety and Wistful Distraction.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Chris said. “Look, the rest of you know. Explain. I’m going to go change.”</p>
<p>He grabbed his bag and hefted it over one shoulder, then began trudging uphill.</p>
<p>“These forms reflect the feelings?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Very much so,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“It sounds like he has more than a few forms,” I said.</p>
<p>“Eight or more, as far as I’ve counted,” Kenzie said. “He said a few, but I think he loses track. There’s wiggle room in each form, too. It depends on a lot of factors. Diet, time since he last used a form, if he pushes for something in the middle.”</p>
<p>“He’s strong,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“He might be,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Kenzie continued to volunteer information. “The forms tend to come with pretty heavy weakness. Anxiety is quick but fragile. That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“I think I get it,” I said. “Can I ask why he’s in the group?”</p>
<p>“The drawbacks,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“The fragility isn’t a drawback?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s one. He doesn’t change all the way back.”</p>
<p>“What?” I asked.</p>
<p>Tristan explained, “He changes to one, he gets a little taller, a little stronger, a little more sluggish. He changes to another, gets better eyes, ears…”</p>
<p>“Thus the headphones,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“…and less responsive in hand-eye coordination to go with it. He tries to balance, but lately it’s been getting worse.”</p>
<p>“What happens if he doesn’t change?”</p>
<p>“The body stays the same,” Sveta said. “He doesn’t change physically.”</p>
<p>“Which is good.”</p>
<p>“But he doesn’t change mentally either. He says he can’t tap those emotions he’s not using, he can’t think as clearly, his thoughts go in circles.”</p>
<p>“Lose-lose,” I said.</p>
<p>“Something like that,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>I could hear Chris’ approach, now. The sound of branches breaking underfoot, the rustling of under&mdash; and over-growth.</p>
<p>He’d grown. He’d shucked off his clothes and he’d donned what looked like an oversized pair of shorts in a coarse cloth. They had to have taken up most of the bag’s space. He was twelve feet tall, with skewed proportions. Large legs, large around the middle, large hands, all with coarse hair. His shoulders seemed somewhat narrow, his neck long, his head only a little larger than normal, with faintly pronounced tusks. His hair, wild before, was just a bit longer than it had been.</p>
<p>“He chose one of the more pleasant looking forms,” Kenzie said, cheerful. She grabbed her stuff.</p>
<p>How in the fuck was I supposed to make someone like Chris marketable? How was I supposed to wrangle Ashley or handle Tristan’s issue?</p>
<p>“Twenty minutes,” Tristan said. “Then he changes back. We should hurry.”</p>
<p>Capture the flag. Right. A part of me wished I hadn’t brought it up. I could have left things at this, with powers explained and demonstrated in brief, and then I could have taken a few days to think.</p>
<p>I needed a few days to think, so feelings wouldn’t be hurt, damage wouldn’t be done.</p>
<p>I didn’t have it. I’d lose too much stock with these guys if I changed my mind. Chris and Ashley especially.</p>
<p>“Who wants to be team leaders?” I asked.</p>
<p>Tristan raised one hand. Ashley raised another.</p>
<p>“Ashley, you want to pick first?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Kenzie.”</p>
<p>“Woo!” Kenzie cheered.</p>
<p>“Sveta,” Tristan said. “You’d be my second pick, after Rain. Weld fan club.”</p>
<p>“Chris,” Ashley said. She pulled on her mask. It was v-shaped, covering the nose, ears, and eyes, leaving just a hint of her eyebrows visible above.</p>
<p>“You guys set up over there, opposite side of the hill, then,” I said. Ashley and the two youngest members of the team.</p>
<p>“You’re filling in for Rain?” Tristan asked me.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I’m mostly interested in seeing how you guys operate, so I’ll mostly stick to playing defense and keeping an eye on things.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I don’t think that’ll be a problem,” he said.</p>
<p>I wasn’t so sure. I could see the way he set his jaw, before he pulled his horned helmet on. I had an idea of his disposition already. I could see the look of Ashley’s eyes behind her mask, too. She wanted to be leader, by the looks of things, and that meant she had something to prove. I saw Chris as the giant, properly smiling for the first time since I’d met him, as he looked back over one shoulder, lumbering away. It made me more concerned, rather than less.</p>
<p>Sveta took my hand, squeezing it. Off to the side, Tristan was drawing something out of motes of light, ten feet tall and twenty feet wide. A wall.</p>
<p>I’d wanted to test them, to see how they functioned as discrete units, and possibly to highlight difficulties.</p>
<p>The more I saw, the less sure I was that these guys were equipped to handle even a friendly contest. There were so many messy parts to this. Above all else, the ones with the power seemed least suited to wield it.</p>
<p>“Believe in us,” Sveta said, her voice soft.</p>
<p>I wanted to. I really did.</p>
<p>“I think,” I said, and I said it to Tristan, “You should take this opportunity to explain your game plan.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap29">Glare &mdash; 3.3</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“You want a game plan?” Tristan said. “Do you mean for here or for the big picture?”</p>
<p><em>I was thinking big picture,</em> I thought, <em>I have doubts right now and a plan would help</em>.</p>
<p>Without voicing that, I said, “Here, but I’m open to hearing about either. If you have something in mind.”</p>
<p>“I want to wait on the big picture stuff so we can include Rain into the discussion. He and I chat regularly, and he’s heard some, but Ashley and I were talking while we waited for you and there’s bits to discuss. Comfort levels.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “We’ll focus on this for now.”</p>
<p>“I’m in charge, then?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“If Sveta is okay with it, you can give it a shot.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay with it,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>He made a small amused sound, his face obscured by his helmet, his hands busy adjusting the fit of his armor as he paced. “There was a time I thought I might end up being in charge of Reach. Things fell through before then. I don’t know if my current mindset works for it, but let’s give this a try.”</p>
<p>I had my own bag, which I’d brought with me. My computer, masks, and the flags, one red and one blue. I fished out the flags, holding both in one hand, and put on one of the masks.</p>
<p>“Victoria, you and I are on defense, then,” he said. “Ashley is going to go hard offense, that’s who she is, and I don’t see Chris holding back. Sveta, you’re going on the attack. You loop around, go the long way if you have to. You might have to dodge Kenzie, but I think you can manage that okay. It’s only her hook thing and flash gun.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a plan,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Alright,” I said.</p>
<p>“I think the benefit here is that we all have some experience,” he said.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“They’re young. Ashley too, in a weird way. They’re led by Ashley and we know how she thinks. I can put my confidence in you, Sveta, if you’re going for their flag.”</p>
<p>“I hope I deserve it.”</p>
<p>“I’m confident in myself and my ability to hold up against a two-person rush, assuming that’s what they do, and I know you’ve got a background, Victoria.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Confidence goes before the fall, though. I think one of the things I regret most in the past is my overconfidence.”</p>
<p>“This is just an exercise. If I’m wrong on this, I’ll own it. Let me plant our flag and get my stuff to adjust my armor, I’ll be right with you.”</p>
<p>As he said it, another wall materialized behind us. A fort with ten foot walls was slowly forming. Tristan wasn’t even focusing that much on the construction, attention-wise. He took the flag before walking off.</p>
<p>I had intentionally chosen a less level area. We were on a hill, playing on a bit of a slope, roughly a ten degree decline with taller grass, weeds, and some pebbly dirt covering the area. Some trees and rocks dotted the space between where their group would set up and where we would.</p>
<p>I had a few reasons for choosing the area. Part of it played off something I had experienced with New Wave. The team had always been split between the fliers and the people on the ground. Me, Aunt Sarah, Crystal and Eric had all been airborne, while my Uncle Neil, Mom, and Dad had all been landbound. It created a dilemma in logistics, and this slightly sloped ground and uneven terrain emphasized that logistics in a way that having to go through and around buildings might in the city.</p>
<p>Sveta functionally had a mover ability, I wasn’t sure about Chris’ capabilities, and Damsel and Rain both had some capabilities in that realm. Supposedly. I wanted to see how the more mobile members of the group worked in coordination with the others.</p>
<p>It was interesting that Tristan had picked both Sveta and me. We were both mobile and Tristan wasn’t. Ashley’s team had three people on foot.</p>
<p>Another reason for this particular location was Rain’s power. It helped him keep his balance, and that was supposedly the extent of it. When he arrived, I wanted to see if it factored in here.</p>
<p>Finally, there was the fact that it put us out of the way. No bystanders, no property to damage.</p>
<p>Kenzie had her head down, her attention on her phone. Ashley and Chris were both smiling. All three were talking. I waited a short bit for them to finish.</p>
<p>“I’m so unbelievably nervous,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I glanced at her, and confirmed that Tristan had stepped away, rummaging in his bag. He was out of earshot.</p>
<p>“I definitely hear you on that,” I said.</p>
<p>“I really want this exercise to work somehow, like Tristan said, but for different reasons. The way you were brought in, you might have come in looking for the bad, and it’s… it’s not all bad. Really. I always wanted a team and the idea of finding one and fitting myself to that team with all of my problems, it seemed impossible or far away.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “You talked about it in the hospital. That you’d talked to Mrs. Yamada and other people about how, putting aside all your issues, you wanted to be a hero.”</p>
<p>“And I wanted a boyfriend, and I wanted to be functional again, and I wanted friends,” she said, staring off at the other three. “And I have almost all of it, but I feel like it could slip out of my grasp if things go wrong. If <em>this</em> goes wrong. I don’t know what I can do if that happens. I’m worried this is going to be a disaster, and that’s making me so anxious.”</p>
<p>“What can I do?” I asked. “I don’t want you to be unhappy.”</p>
<p>“Like I said before, I really want you to believe in us here. I want you to give us a chance. Even if this is bad to start.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“And&mdash; I’m sorry if this is pushing a line or if you have reasons, but don’t be so stiff?”</p>
<p>She sounded so uncertain as she said it. I drew in a deep breath and smiled at her.</p>
<p>“I’m the one with a prosthetic body. We’re friends, right?” She smiled, uncertain, and I smiled at her. “So I don’t want you tense around me.”</p>
<p>“I’m nervous in my own way, and I think that’s how it shows,” I said. “It’s not you. Can I give you a bit of a hug, here, emotional support?”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>I put one arm around her shoulders and squeezed. Sveta moved her head in my direction, I moved mine in her direction, knocking heads with her a bit.</p>
<p>Off in the distance, even though she was more than a hundred feet away, I could hear Kenzie cooing and ‘aww’ing over the hug, as she looked at us.</p>
<p>“What did I miss?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I’m anxious,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Tristan said. “Your control gets bad when you’re nervous, right? You have more reflexive movements?”</p>
<p>“It gets so fucking shitty,” Sveta said. “I’m sorry. I’m worried I’ll be terrible because I’m all over the place inside here. I don’t know if you can hear it, but I keep fumbling because I’ll reflexively reach out to grab something off in the distance and hit the wall of the suit instead, and then I have to reach for the right control ring again.”</p>
<p>“Do the best you can,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about grading you as an individual,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s about the team,” Sveta said. “I don’t want to let the team down. Can we start? I’ll get more nervous if we wait.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>The other three weren’t wrapped up in their discussion anymore. I called out, “You guys want your flag?”</p>
<p>“Here,” Sveta said. She held out her hand. I passed her the blue flag.</p>
<p>She passed it to the others, hand and forearm gripping the flag, tendrils pushing the hand and forearm. She stopped short, relying on only the momentum so it only punched Chris lightly in the man-boob. He caught her hand and arm in one large hand, plucking the flag free before releasing her hand. He smiled as he held it up, then he reached low to hand it to Kenzie. The two of them went to plant it, with Chris picking up a fallen tree on the way.</p>
<p>It seemed Chris and Kenzie got along better like this.</p>
<p>Ashley didn’t join them. Instead, she started walking toward us, picking her way through weeds and grass. She still had a partial smile on her face from before.</p>
<p>I flew to meet her partway.</p>
<p>“Ground rules?” she asked, when I was closer.</p>
<p>“Place your flag. You grab ours and bring it to yours, or vice-versa. Whoever has both flags at their starting point wins. Try to avoid hurting the trees. No personal injuries that aren’t going to heal in a day. Bruises and scrapes are inevitable, but let’s avoid them if we can.”</p>
<p>“Understood.” She turned to walk away, one hand raised to give me an over-the-shoulder salute as she did.</p>
<p>Tristan began altering the battlefield behind her, drawing out fifty little sparks to move along the surface of our side of the hill.</p>
<p>The other team was just on the other side of a trio of trees. The nervousness we all felt was apparent as Kenzie’s cube lit up, making a deep beep sound.</p>
<p>All three faces of the cube that I could see had lit up. Numbers were apparent. ’10’… ‘9’… ‘8’…</p>
<p>“It’s worth remembering that she can remotely control the cube,” Tristan said. “Hm.”</p>
<p>“Just the flashlight gun and the eyehook, right?” Sveta asked, giving Tristan a look.</p>
<p>Tristan moved his hand, and finalized his alteration to the slope between our fort and the halfway point of the battlefield. Uneven ground, raised segments and lowered ones. Most of it was flat, the spikes sticking out of the sides or toward the ground at an angle. The material was solid, white with orange-red in the crevices, running through it like ore in rock.</p>
<p>The timer continued. ‘3’… ‘2’… ‘1’… ‘Go’.</p>
<p>They came out of the trees. As Tristan had suggested, Ashley’s plan was to go on the attack.</p>
<p>All three of them. Kenzie had changed, overalls gone, replaced with a skintight suit that mirrored her outfit in color and where it changed from black to pink to red. Chris had his head turned, and he was using one hand to cram the last few feet of the dead tree into his mouth.</p>
<p>Ashley was on foot. White eyes were wide open behind her mask, the pupils not visible from this distance.</p>
<p>“This is fine. Same plan,” Tristan said, not sounding bothered in the least.</p>
<p><em>Two versus three, while Sveta grabs their flag.</em></p>
<p>Sveta reached for a tree and found her grip, hauling herself away.</p>
<p>Tristan began creating barricades and obstructions, aimed at being knee-height, to slow them down.</p>
<p>Ashley hurdled the first two. Chris trampled his way through the three that had been put in his way.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned, aimed, and fired her flash gun in Sveta’s direction. She missed, aimed again, and fired. The second shot caught Sveta in its area.</p>
<p>“You take Chris and Kenzie, I’ll work on Ashley,” Tristan said. He sounded confident. “Keep an eye on Kenzie, make sure she doesn’t fall.”</p>
<p>I flew to intercept. Chris had one hand full with the tree, mouth distended with a fat tongue sticking out, apparently to keep the tree from rubbing against his lower row of teeth; his hand served to protect the other teeth.</p>
<p>I was put in mind of the man I’d seen during the broken trigger, who’d had a tree come out the other direction.</p>
<p>Chris laughed, deep and booming, tree digested. He lowered his chin, mouth closed, hands and arms up to protect his face and guard Kenzie.</p>
<p>I could deal with big and strong. I flew closer&mdash; saw Kenzie turn, aiming her gun at me, and changed course, covering my face and head, my forcefield up.</p>
<p>Even turned partially away, my arms up, the momentary flash of light blinded me. A full second passed, and my sight didn’t return. I could hear Chris’ laugh, Kenzie’s amusement. My forcefield hadn’t helped.</p>
<p>I felt the forcefield meet resistance, and I forced it to shut off before Chris’ hand could close around me. I pushed out with my aura to try to throw him off balance and buy myself a second, and changed course. I felt his fingers graze my back, dragging against cloth and not finding enough slack to get a grip.</p>
<p>Blindness was disorienting. Blindness when flying made it hard to tell which way was up and which way was down, and I knew it would get worse before it got better.</p>
<p>I flew away and at the ground, forcefield up, and landed hard. I felt Tristan’s creation shatter under and around me as my power absorbed the hit, fragments bouncing off of me, dust collecting on me.</p>
<p>“Are you okay!?” I heard Kenzie call out.</p>
<p>“I’m fine!” I replied.</p>
<p>“Don’t give away your position if you’ve blinded them!” I heard Ashley.</p>
<p>I heard a noise, and at first I thought it was Chris dismantling the fort. It sounded like someone was tearing the world’s largest sheet of paper, nails on a blackboard, an alien’s scream from a science fiction movie that echoed far more than it should, a sharp explosion, and any number of other things, all overlapping and working against one another.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and tried to make out the surroundings despite the spots of light that were exploding against the backs of my eyeballs.</p>
<p>Chris was large enough for me to make out his general shape. I could make out Ashley and Tristan’s positions, but the only reason I could distinguish the two was because Ashley dressed in black and Tristan had more color to his costume.</p>
<p>Right. I had a few tricks up my sleeve I’d been considering. This was an opportunity to try one.</p>
<p>I took off, and I activated my forcefield momentarily as I did it, pushing out at the cracked chunks of stonelike ground, sending pieces rolling and sliding in the wake of my takeoff. I needed their attention. I saw Chris slow momentarily, mid-stride as he walked toward the fort.</p>
<p>I didn’t fly straight for them, but around, circling closer to the fort. I paused, giving them time to see me, and then flew straight for Chris’ face, full speed.</p>
<p>I stopped only a few feet short, hitting him with my aura instead of my fist. Full-strength, point-blank, a hit to the emotional rather than the physical.</p>
<p>The reaction was much the same as if I’d punched him. Forward movement stopped, reversed, an off-balance stumble backward.</p>
<p>“Holy fuck,” I could hear Tristan.</p>
<p>I heard Damsel’s response, but I had other focuses than making out the words. It might have been ‘pay attention to your opponent’ or ‘pay attention to who you’re fighting’.</p>
<p>I was busy flying around Chris, one hand extended so it maintained contact with him, let me gently push him, all while helping me to navigate while still partially blind. Before he fully had his balance, I caught him by the shoulders and pulled him back and down toward the ground.</p>
<p>He walked backward rather than topple, helped by the fact that his head was small, his shoulders and neck narrow relative to his lower body. It was part of why his center of balance was low to the ground, with his weight gathered around gut, butt, and legs.</p>
<p>Kenzie’s pincer-claw grabbed for my arm, then pulled my arm away from Chris. I let it, grabbing the prehensile length of it between Kenzie and me. Not a huge factor. One hand still on Chris’ shoulder, I activated my forcefield, using the added strength to pull at Chris. He continued his backward walk until he stumbled into one of Tristan’s sections of raised ground.</p>
<p>He toppled, and I shifted my position to guide his fall for the first half of the way. The focus on the latter half of the way was letting my forcefield down and catching Kenzie.</p>
<p>Chris fell flat on his back. Kenzie wriggled momentarily, and I deposited her on Chris’ chest, to make getting to his feet just a little bit harder. The claw slipped free of my arm.</p>
<p>My vision was clearing enough for me to see vague expressions, without precise detail. Chris was grinning, shaking with a laugh or chuckle.</p>
<p>“Come on, get up, get up!” Kenzie goaded him.</p>
<p>“Get off me then!” Chris boomed.</p>
<p>Orange motes were starting to surround them.</p>
<p>“Victoria!” Tristan called out. “Switch with me!”</p>
<p>The words were barely out of his mouth when Ashley used her power again. It was noisy to the point I worried my ears would be ringing an hour after this exercise. I could see it as a visible blur of shadow aimed behind her and toward the ground. She used the recoil to launch herself off to one side, to help her get around and past Tristan. More orange motes appeared in the direction she was going.</p>
<p>She used her power again, changing course to fly straight for Tristan. She planted one foot on his shoulder, stepped down so her back grazed against his, her long hair draping over his head and shoulders, aimed forward with both hands, and used her power a third time just as she touched ground, her back to his.</p>
<p>A power-augmented body-check. The recoil of her power pushed her in the opposite direction she fired, but because she was in contact with Tristan, she pushed him too. She stumbled, but he sprawled to the ground, his armor striking the hard platform he’d created on the slope, metal screeching and clashing against stone.</p>
<p>The orange motes that had started to appear around Chris and Kenzie came to life around them, an especially spiky, irregular outcropping with a thin ridge extending out to the growth he’d been making in front of Ashley’s original course, which became its own vaguely pineapple-shaped formation.</p>
<p>He’d wanted me to deal with Ashley. Okay. She was rolling her shoulders, rubbing at one, while she stalked toward the fort.</p>
<p>I could see better, so I could possibly pull this technique off better. I flew at her, and she barely seemed to pay me any mind.</p>
<p>My feet touched ground, helping to stop me as I reversed my direction of flight to cancel out my forward movement. I’d wanted to avoid all physical contact, but I did bump my shoulder into hers as I went from flying at near-top speed to a full stop, my face a couple of inches from hers, well inside her personal space.</p>
<p>As with Chris, I used my emotion aura.</p>
<p>As had been the case with Chris, the effect was immediate and profound. She stumbled back much as if I’d flown into her and given her a strong shove, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>I’d barely found my own footing when she found hers. Another blast, jarring for my ears. My vision was already suffering, and it was made worse by the plume of dust and debris around and to one side of her. She used the blast and a push of her legs to throw herself at the wall.</p>
<p>The moment she made contact with it, she used her power again, flinging herself out into empty space, hair and dress fluttering.</p>
<p>My first instinct was that she was going to have a rough landing, that I might need to catch her. Before I’d even figured out how I might do it, she used her power once more. She was aiming up at an angle, so that meant she was pushed <em>down</em> by the recoil.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a mere drop-kick or a fall, but a spearing plunge. I did much as she’d done, pushing out with my legs in conjunction with a use of my power, my flight, to get out of her way.</p>
<p>With the speed and general profile of a pickaxe head driven into the ground, she landed on hard ground, in the same spot I’d been standing. There was a second where she stood there, hair draping down, hands out at her sides with fingers splayed, and then one of her legs wobbled and she dropped to one knee.</p>
<p>“Are you&mdash;” I started. I thought I saw her move and paused. “Are you okay? That landing looks like it hurt.”</p>
<p>She raised her face and looked up at me. White eyes behind a black mask, behind white hair.</p>
<p>She used her power again. Cords, columns, and shaped explosions of lensing, bending, and darkening within the roughly cone-shaped area, over the one or two seconds that she was creating each blast. She didn’t even rise from her kneeling position. She threw herself at me, and this time she caught me entirely off guard. Her knees hit my shoulders, at least one of her arms caught me around the head, the fabric of her dress pulling against my face as she tried to fold herself around my head.</p>
<p><em>Holy shit</em>, was my first thought. She was not letting up. Every time she acted, it was with the energy of a sprinter taking off from their starting position, except her power gave her more of a push, and the jarring noises only magnified the surprise of it.</p>
<p>My second thought was that she had seized my head. She wanted to take me down to the ground, much as I’d toppled Chris. There were two ways I could go. To roll with the movement and use it, or to fight against it.</p>
<p>My instinct was to fight against it. I used my flight, going <em>up</em> when she wanted to take me down. I used my aura, which was more effective when people were close, and she was wrapped around my head. I used my forcefield, only for one moment, while reaching up, putting my forearm against her ribs, and pried her off of me.</p>
<p>She used her power in the same instant she was pried off&mdash; fast enough that I was left with the feeling she had expected to use it while still holding onto me. Her landing looked like a rough one, sprawling, one shin, one foot, one hand bracing against the ground as she skidded.</p>
<p>I saw her slowly clench and unclench her hands, rolling one shoulder. She didn’t stand.</p>
<p>“Hoo,” I said. My heart was pounding, and I fanned myself a bit with my hand. “You do remember this is a training exercise, right?”</p>
<p>“You do realize my team is going to win this?” she retorted. Her hands shifted position slightly.</p>
<p>Her face gave away nothing, I realized. It didn’t help that with the dust, her hair across her face, and the last remaining spots of light in my vision, I couldn’t make out her pupils. Her hands and where they were pointing were one of her tells. Her shoulders another. She was thin, but especially as she crouched there, hands slightly behind her and at her sides, shoulders pointing forward, I could see the muscles underneath the skin around her shoulder and shoulder blade.</p>
<p>Was there power or Manton protection there, keeping her from dislocating her shoulders when she used the recoil to move around like that? Was it just strength and practice?</p>
<p>I’d relied on instinct to respond to her, and I didn’t love that I’d relied on that instinct. I wanted to be careful and thoughtful about the moves I made and Ashley’s approach allowed absolutely none of that. I was left to digest that I’d reacted to her by fighting, going the opposite direction instead of the Judo-like approach of using the enemy’s strength against them.</p>
<p>Was I okay with that? If I had to rationalize my choice, I’d fought her because I could only use the enemy’s momentum against them if I knew which way they were going, and Ashley was hard to predict.</p>
<p>Well, just a bit less difficult now, as I stopped looking for more obvious tells. She had stopped rolling her shoulder. I saw the muscles tense.</p>
<p>“Victoria!”</p>
<p>The shout interrupted both of us, as she planned her next move and I readied my response. It was Tristan calling. Ashley and I both looked.</p>
<p>“Come and help!” he called out.</p>
<p>I flew back and away, out of Ashley’s reach, looking.</p>
<p>Chris, legs embedded in spiky rock, was using both hands to haul what looked like a long, thin rod out of his throat. He’d swallowed the length of the dead tree like a sword-swallower swallowed a blade, and now he was drawing it back out, changed.</p>
<p>Narrower, thinner, smoother, and slick with fluids.</p>
<p>Chris, it seemed, wasn’t just the kind of changer who could adapt his form. He was the kind of changer who gained new sorts of powers while in an alternate form.</p>
<p>He hauled the last of the tree free of his mouth. Fifteen feet long, thicker at the end he had just removed than at the end he held, now that he was turning it around to get it in a position he could wield it. Too long to be a proper club, not quite a rod either.</p>
<p>Kenzie had her flash gun out. Tristan had thrown up a short wall, just tall and wide enough that he could hide behind it. Kenzie’s eyehook extended from her belt, through one of her hands, and out to Tristan, with a grip on his leg. She was simultaneously trying to circle around to get at an angle where she could shoot and blind Tristan and she was using the claw at the end of the prehensile arm to try and drag him out of the cover, helped by tugs with her hand.</p>
<p>Kenzie’s efforts left Chris entirely unmolested as he brought his weapon down, shattering Tristan’s created ground, freeing his legs.</p>
<p>“Leave her!” Tristan ordered. “We’ll let her get the flag, deal with these two, and catch her on her return trip!”</p>
<p>I flew a little further away.</p>
<p>Sveta&mdash; I looked off in the direction of the enemy’s camp.</p>
<p>Little blue flags decorated the landscape on their side of the playing field. They were situated on every rock, in every crevice, on every flat expanse of ground, on every tree branch. Sveta was perched on a rock in the midst of it all.</p>
<p>I looked at Kenzie’s cube. One face of it was glowing. The projector.</p>
<p>That would be why they had been smiling, then.</p>
<p>I started my flight toward toward Tristan.</p>
<p>“You’ll regret ignoring me,” Ashley said, behind me.</p>
<p>Pride, respect, they were key factors here. I could remember the meeting, the narrowing of the eyes. I knew Tristan was in a tough spot, but I paused, turning around in the air. I had to raise my voice to be heard with the distance between Ashley and me, as I said, “We’re not ignoring you. We’re dealing with you two against one.”</p>
<p>I left her to limp toward the wall while I flew to Tristan’s side. I landed beside Kenzie, hard, pushing out with my aura.</p>
<p>She twisted around, gun in hand, and I caught the gun, snatching it out of her hand.</p>
<p>“Hey,” she said. She reached out with her hand, and I pulled the gun away. She let go of Tristan and reached out for the gun with the eye-hook. I grabbed the eye-hook, and then wrapped the length of the prehensile arm around her upper body, tying her up with it.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she said, again. She laughed. “Chris help!”</p>
<p>I didn’t need to ask, and I liked that I didn’t need to ask. Orange motes began to surround Kenzie.</p>
<p>“No, no, no, no!” Kenzie said. “Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris!”</p>
<p>The head of the long club was poked out between Kenzie and me, separating us. Kenzie started to back away, and the orange motes became solid rock, encapsulating her legs. Tristan lunged forward to catch her before her upper body came down and her head cracked down against his rocky terrain.</p>
<p>I flew up a little ways, putting myself between them and Chris. Chris drew the fat end of the club back, and then smacked it against his palm. He laughed, deep and low, and pointed at Kenzie.</p>
<p>“Stop laughing at me and help, you doofus!”</p>
<p>I had Kenzie’s gun in hand, I could have shot Chris, but I had my deep reservations about using a tinker’s stuff, even a nonlethal gun that temporarily blinded.</p>
<p>Ashley used her power. I could hear the sound of it, and I saw the wall break.</p>
<p>“By the way,” Tristan said, looking in that direction. “We’re not catching her on the return trip.”</p>
<p>He blurred, and with that blurring, the rock blurred too. White with orange-red veins became clear water, reflecting the blue of the sky and the green of the trees above and grass below. The front wall of the fort that Ashley had just penetrated and the platform that Kenzie and Chris were standing on became frothing water.</p>
<p>With the slope, that water flowed downhill, carrying Ashley and Kenzie down to the base of the hill, amid branches, mud, and sticks. Ashley used her power at the start and toward the end, to little effect.</p>
<p>Chris brought his rod down, stabbing it deep into the ground, and held onto it for leverage. It had to be sturdier than the dead tree had been, because it didn’t bend and it didn’t break. Condensed down, maybe, shaped to be hard.</p>
<p>He reared back, and he <em>blew</em>. He’d broken down and processed more of the dead tree than what he’d used to condense it into a giant club-staff. He exhaled a cloud of wet sawdust.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to put up my forcefield if it would catch the sawdust, so I endured it, flew closer, and used my forcefield for only as long as it took to kick the stick he was holding onto with all of my strength.</p>
<p>It broke, and with it breaking, Chris fell down the hill, rolling over wet grass and weeds, until he came to a stop against a cluster of two trees that had grown next to one another.</p>
<p>He began to pick himself up, working his way up the hill, stabbing down to pierce the ground with his half-stick and plant it there like an ice-climber might use a piton. The slope was just a little steeper at the base of the hill, and the water had become rock again, smooth and with the spikes all pointed downward, not good grips.</p>
<p>He swallowed hard, giving me a suspicion about what he was about to do. He spat out a ball of wood pulp and phlegm, and I flew to one side, letting it sail past me.</p>
<p>I was put in mind of Crawler &mdash; the changer power, the spitting, the joyful monster. Crawler had laughed too.</p>
<p>Crawler had critically injured me with his acid spit, and that had let Amy get her hands on me the second time.</p>
<p>It was a dark, unpleasant thought.</p>
<p>Tristan was focused on a point off to the side. I turned to look, and I saw that he was creating orange motes around the projector box.</p>
<p>The motes solidified, and the box was encased in a thorny encasement of rock.</p>
<p>I turned to look, keeping one eye on Chris, and I saw the flags were still there.</p>
<p>“Nope! That’s not going to work! Good luck finding our flag!” Kenzie called out. She loosed an over the top, mocking laugh.</p>
<p>Tristan turned the encasement to water.</p>
<p>“I said it was waterproofed before! That’s not going to do anything!” Kenzie called out, before doing her level best to laugh harder, even though she had already been laughing at her limit.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Tristan said, loud enough for them to hear.</p>
<p>Sveta made her way back in three moves, from the other team’s camp to a rock, rock to tree, tree to our camp.</p>
<p>She hauled herself up to the top of one of Tristan’s walls and she held up the two flags.</p>
<p>Ashley and Chris, who were making their way up the hill, stopped climbing.</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes! That was so great, that was fun, we have to do this again!”</p>
<p>From what Kenzie was saying, she didn’t seem to mind losing much. She practically bounced with excitement.</p>
<p>Tristan created stairs on the slope.</p>
<p>Sveta joined Tristan and me as the others climbed the stairs. Tristan put out one gauntlet, and she tapped her prosthetic hand against it. I offered my own fist to her, and she tapped her fist against it, before wrapping her arms around me in a brief hug.</p>
<p>A stoic Ashley had Kenzie clinging to her as she reached the top.</p>
<p>“&mdash;were so cool, it was like how you were in the videos&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Ease up, Kenzie,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Kenzie let go of Ashley, bouncing on the spot before reaching up to her lens-mask and pulling it off. With the mask’s removal, her costume flickered in places, like an image that had been badly compressed, with heavy artifacting.</p>
<p>“This was everything I wanted it to be and more,” Kenzie said. “I can’t believe you found the flag.”</p>
<p>“I&mdash;” Sveta started.</p>
<p>“Waitwaitwaitwait,” Kenzie said. “Wait. Um. Okay. I have this covered.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Kenzie pulled out her smartphone.</p>
<p>The projector made a sound, and then images streaked the hill, before correcting. Ghostly images of all of us, life-size. The images included the constructions Tristan had made.</p>
<p>It looked like where we had all been standing earlier in the match, when I had been facing down Ashley.</p>
<p>The images zipped around as Kenzie changed the time, blurring and streaking before correcting into their proper shapes.</p>
<p>“I saved everything, so we can look back and watch how things played out or compare notes,” Kenzie said. “So we can do stuff like this…”</p>
<p>The images blurred and moved, then shifted, so the scenes that were projected no longer lined up on the battlefield.</p>
<p>It was Sveta, perched on a branch, flag in hand. Another blur, moving the clock back.</p>
<p>Sveta removed one of her prosthetic hands. Fifty or more tendrils snapped out.</p>
<p>“You grabbed <em>every</em> flag,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I grabbed at every flag,” Sveta said. “I had to reposition a few times, so I probably grabbed at some fake ones several times. It didn’t help that I couldn’t see that well after being shot.”</p>
<p>Kenzie cackled. Chris smothered her cackling with a large hand. Kenzie fought back, trying to get out from under Chris’ hand, and she did a pretty poor job of it.</p>
<p>It was weird and good to see her finally acting like an actual kid. Too much excitement in her system, but that wasn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>Once Kenzie had settled down more, we walked through the entire fight, focusing on each person. Sveta was first, easy enough.</p>
<p>Tristan was next, and he made mention of the platform, and how he’d wanted to make sure nobody had footing when the rock turned to water, so he’d raised the ground some. He had obviously plotted the trap from early on.</p>
<p>“Kenzie? Do you want to report what you were doing?” Tristan asked, once he was done explaining what he’d done to Sveta.</p>
<p>“Wait,” Kenzie said. “Rain’s here. I’ll point the way.”</p>
<p>It took a couple of minutes before Rain and Kenzie’s camera-drone arrived at the base of the hill.</p>
<p>Chris was half the size he had been, and his proportions were returning to normal. As he shrank, he rearranged the voluminous shorts he’d been wearing, ensuring his modesty was protected. His old outfit was contained within a pocket on the inside of the shorts, and he gathered it together, folded up, the clothes piled on his lap, along with what looked like a pencil case.</p>
<p>Even though he was returning to the person he’d been, physically, his smile lingered.</p>
<p>“Rainnn!” Kenzie called out, while Rain was still making his way to us. “Did you bring tinker stuff!?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Rain responded.</p>
<p>“Yusss,” Kenzie said. “This is the best day.”</p>
<p>“You could have waited twenty seconds for Rain to show up and asked him in a normal volume,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know now.”</p>
<p>Chris groaned at her, putting his face closer to hers.</p>
<p>Kenzie groaned louder, exaggerated, putting her face closer to his.</p>
<p>Chris groaned even louder, guttural, using some of the residual transformation to play up the sound. His forehead pressed against hers, hard enough she had to push back to avoid being pushed over.</p>
<p>Rather than try to top it, Kenzie sat back down. “I like you when you’re like this.”</p>
<p>“Naked?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“<em>No!</em>” Kenzie said. “Geez.”</p>
<p>“Why does it feel like every time I enter a conversation, it’s a weird topic?” Rain asked, joining us where we sat on Tristan-created seats and benches.</p>
<p>“I like you when you’re happy,” Kenzie said. She fussed with her hair, looking down. “I like you a lot like this.”</p>
<p>I was put in mind of her comments about Chris before she’d gotten in Erin’s car, after leaving the group meeting. Like she didn’t have the worldly experience to know people didn’t say stuff like that in such an unguarded, dead obvious way.</p>
<p>“I still think you’re annoying as shit,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Sveta kicked him.</p>
<p>Kenzie snorted, smiling as she looked up at him. “I know.”</p>
<p>“Nah. I’m joking. You’re fine. I think we did pretty good.”</p>
<p>“I think we did too. It would have worked except Tristan and Byron are strong and Victoria is <em>oof</em> and Sveta was the best counter to what we were doing. We should fill Rain in.”</p>
<p>“That would be nice,” Rain said. “It was you two and…”</p>
<p>He turned to look around the group, saw Ashley, and didn’t finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“And me,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Here, I can show you the replay,” Kenzie said. “But I want to see your tinker arms too, before we run out of time.”</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of time,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Wait, here, you take the remote, and Rain, you can hand me the arm, I won’t break anything, I promise.”</p>
<p>Rain rummaged in his backpack, “I wouldn’t blame you if you did, it’s fragile and shitty. You think it would help your eyehook?”</p>
<p>“It might! But I’m really interested in the interface. You like to have multiple arms, you said?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. For what little it’s worth.”</p>
<p>“And you control it with your brain, once it’s plugged in?” Kenzie asked. When Rain nodded, she asked, “How does the brain know how to control it?”</p>
<p>“I map the brain patterns for input and output and the panel here, between the attachment and the actual arm, it acts like an extension of the brain.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make any sense,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Tristan was fiddling with the remote, and seemed to be having trouble with the progression of time, with images jumping all over the place. Sveta, Kenzie, and Rain were all focused on the arm, with Ashley periodically joining in when prodded.</p>
<p>Chris was sitting on the bench, cloth around him as he shrunk down to a more ordinary size. He was smiling more than before as he rummaged for his headphones and a chocolate bar.</p>
<p>“Your mood seems better,” I said to him.</p>
<p>The smile dropped away. He looked at me and shrugged. “It’s different. I feel more human, mentally and emotionally.”</p>
<p>The change hadn’t seemed to make any difference in how he looked, either. Were the changes subtle?</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I grasped it all,” I told him. “Once you change, it’s…?”</p>
<p>I trailed off.</p>
<p>“It’s like a hit of a drug,” he said. “Focus, surprise, sadness, appreciation, disgust, fear, anger, and then this one.”</p>
<p>“Joy?”</p>
<p>“I call this particular flavor of it Wan Indulgence,” he said. He bit down on the chocolate bar, then closed his eyes, clearly enjoying it. He talked with his mouth full, “Can be enjoyment. I’ll feel it more normally for a few days now that I’ve changed.”</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” Kenzie said. “Tristan, give that back, you suck at it.”</p>
<p>Tristan was still fiddling with Kenzie’s remote for the projector box.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make any sense. Why isn’t it easier to move forward and back in time?”</p>
<p>“Because the box doesn’t perceive time, you dummy. It perceives images.”</p>
<p>“Why not have it perceive things like time, so you can go backward and forward in time without doing… whatever arcane thing you’re doing right now?”</p>
<p>“Because if it perceived time,” Kenzie said, patiently, her focus on the smartphone remote, “Then it wouldn’t perceive images. And that would be a dumb thing for a projector box that works with images. Dummy.”</p>
<p>“You can stop calling me a dummy now.”</p>
<p>“I will if you stop being dumb. This stuff is <em>obvious</em>.”</p>
<p>“It’s really not,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Kenzie sighed, very dramatically. “Who are we following next?”</p>
<p>“It’d be nice to show Rain the entire thing,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“It works best with a point of view,” Kenzie said. She looked at Tristan and rolled her eyes a little.</p>
<p>“If you keep that up, you’re going to see orange lights swirling over your head. Then a rock is going to fall on you or, more likely, I’ll swap out and you’ll get a spray of cold water.”</p>
<p>Kenzie stuck out her tongue at Tristan.</p>
<p>I was aware that Ashley hadn’t participated enthusiastically in the conversation. I suspected why. I hesitated, then ventured, “I’d really like to see how Ashley approached things.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>My suspicions were stronger. I went on, “Frankly, I hope this isn’t taken the wrong way, but you’re really intimidating to go up against.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” she said. “It’s the intention.”</p>
<p>“A big part of the reason I swapped out with Victoria is that I had no idea what to do,” Tristan said. “I couldn’t catch you with my power, and you’re faster than me on foot.”</p>
<p>Kenzie was changing the perspective. She created a projection of the hillside and shrank things down, then created more projections, showing an image off to one side of our gathering, showing a zoomed in portion of what the little diorama-sized projection was showing as a whole. The focus started with the three emerging from the trees, trampling through and hurdling the barriers Tristan created.</p>
<p>She jumped to Tristan trying to deal with Ashley.</p>
<p>“Those blasts are as scary as shit,” Tristan said. “Every time you used one, even if you were five feet away and you weren’t aiming at me, I was flinching. I saw what it was doing to my powerstuff, and I did <em>not</em> want that to happen to my bodystuff.”</p>
<p>He’d realized what I was doing, and why, I realized. Ashley was dejected at losing and we could give her a bit of a morale boost. She seemed to like being scary.</p>
<p>I wasn’t <em>wholly</em> sure it was good to feed her ego on that front, but I wasn’t sure I liked the alternative, either.</p>
<p>“I have better control than that. I’m not an idiot,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying you are,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious you have control,” I said. “Kenzie, can you show the walljump?”</p>
<p>“There are two.”</p>
<p>“The one with me,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie jumped to the scene. Ashley leaping off of the wall with one foot, her power just starting to explode out from her hands. The power looked more solid in projection than it did in reality.</p>
<p>“For the record,” Kenzie said. “If I was moving through this recording in <em>time</em> and not <em>space</em>, then I’d have to fast forward and rewind and skip around to find this, but I don’t, so I hope people are realizing why this is better.”</p>
<p>“I’m fully in support of dumping water on Kenzie’s head,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“The walljump,” I said. “The sequences of blasts to maneuver and the whole-body coordination it must take. That, to me, says control.”</p>
<p>“All for nothing,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was not for nothing,” I said. “I got to see and experience what you do, I respect the spatial awareness. The instinct&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I fell for a trap,” she said. “I knew there would be water and I thought I could avoid it if I used my power in time, I didn’t expect there to be so much.”</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen each other’s powers in action,” Tristan said. “Surprises are inevitable. You surprised the shit out of me, many times, and I got one good surprise off. When we do it again, we’ll know each other’s powers better. It’s part of why we’re doing the exercises in the first place.”</p>
<p>“I failed,” Ashley said. She stood up, and she rubbed one shoulder. “I was tested and I failed.”</p>
<p>“Right from the start,” Sveta said, jumping into the conversation “When we were standing around figuring out what we’d do, Victoria told me that this wasn’t a test of us as individuals. It’s a test of our coordination as a team.”</p>
<p>“I can find that on the recording,” Kenzie said. “It’ll be hard to find, though.”</p>
<p>“Hah,” Chris said. Kenzie pushed his shoulder.</p>
<p>“My team failed,” Ashley said, oblivious to the pair. “No. My team was set up to fail.”</p>
<p>“Wait, woah,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Ashley clenched one hand into a fist. “You realize if I hadn’t been holding back, I could have annihilated each and every one of you?”</p>
<p>“<em>Woah,</em>” Tristan said, with emphasis. “Ashley&mdash;”</p>
<p>She whirled on him, pointing, and he flinched, going silent. I stood from my seat.</p>
<p>“Ashley,” I said, because I wanted her attention off of Tristan.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>not</em> Ashley,” she said, her voice hard. “Nobody has called me that in a long, long time. I’m only Ashley because the therapists insisted and the others needed an actual name to put on the paperwork. I’m <em>Damsel of Distress!</em>”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “Can we&mdash;”</p>
<p>I was spoken over. “I was a member of the Slaughterhouse Nine. They <em>selected me</em>. They had me kill and maim people. I didn’t mind doing it then, and I could do it here without blinking.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’ve died and I came back with only the vicious parts of me intact! All of the warmth, the good memories, the family, they’re just a fuzzy, indistinct dream. Those memories have no hold on me. The killing? Taking people’s arms and legs and watching them bleed out? <em>That’s</em> clear as anything. I could do the same to any of you.”</p>
<p>I wanted the younger and more vulnerable members of the team to back away, to get clear of trouble, but I worried that if I tried to indicate that, it might provoke her. Everyone was still, and nobody, myself included, was really breathing.</p>
<p>“This was an idiotic game, and I. Don’t. Play. Games.”</p>
<p>“Count down from ten,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Ashley whirled on him. I left the ground, flying closer, stopping when things didn’t escalate further.</p>
<p>“Count down from ten,” Rain said. “That’s what Mrs. Yamada says, isn’t it? When you’re wound up.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine when <em>she</em> says it.”</p>
<p>“It should be fine when any of us say it,” Rain said. “Count.”</p>
<p>Ashley tensed. I could see it in her shoulders and the way the tendons stood out in her hands.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent.</p>
<p>I waited. Ten seconds passed. Then the fifteenth, then the twentieth.</p>
<p>“Feel better?” Sveta ventured.</p>
<p>Ashley turned, staring Sveta down. “No.”</p>
<p>“Count down from a hundred,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Count,” Rain said, his voice soft. “Please. You’ve said before, when you get like this, there’s a part of you that’s saying you don’t want to act this way, and you can’t listen to it. So listen to the numbers first, then listen to that part of you.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that easy.”</p>
<p>“It’s&mdash;”</p>
<p>“It’s <em>not that easy</em>,” she said. “And I’m going to walk away. You do your thing. Let me do mine.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain said.</p>
<p>She limped away, hands in fists at her side. We were silent as we watched her go.</p>
<p>She walked up the hill, found a rock, and leaned against it, her back to us, and I let my feet touch ground.</p>
<p>“We knew it was coming sooner or later,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Spooky,” Sveta said.”I expected a small outburst to start with. That was&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Medium-small,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Kenzie stood up, gathering her things.</p>
<p>“Stay, Kenzie,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“She wants to be left alone.”</p>
<p>“This thing?” Kenzie asked. “It’s not you guys being the adults and me as the kid, listening to what adults say. We’re all equal members of this team. And this is what I’m going to do, and if I get hurt that’s fine, but this is right for me. You can tell me what to do with some other stuff but not this stuff.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous,” I said. “Leave her be.”</p>
<p>“No,” Kenzie said, voice firm. She put her hand on her flash gun. She looked at all of us, then said, softer, “No.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Kenzie,” Sveta said. “Go. Be careful.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure?” Tristan asked Sveta.</p>
<p>But Kenzie was already jogging off in Ashley’s direction.</p>
<p>When Kenzie was out of earshot, but before she had reached Ashley, Sveta raised one hand and said, voice quiet, “If there’s a problem, I’ll haul her back.”</p>
<p>“That takes a second or two,” I said. “Sparring with Ashley, I gotta say she moves faster than that.”</p>
<p>“And your grip isn’t a hundred percent,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Sveta set her jaw, hand pointed at Kenzie.</p>
<p>Kenzie reached Ashley, and with Ashley’s movement, we all tensed, preparing to act.</p>
<p>Ashley turned back to look out at the distance, and Kenzie climbed up on the rock Ashley was leaning against.</p>
<p>A moment later, Kenzie had her headphones out of a pocket. She plugged it into her phone, reached down, and put an earbud in Ashley’s ear, then put another in her ear, before lying down on the rock.</p>
<p>Slowly, Sveta lowered her hand.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I gave my reasons before, so did Rain, so did Kenzie,” Sveta said. “We’ve had this discussion. This isn’t news.”</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to know it and see it in therapy, it’s another to experience it in the wild,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked, again. “You can’t&mdash; I understand reaching out to people, but can you really reach out to people who aren’t reaching back? Can you give forgiveness and understanding to someone who isn’t looking for it?”</p>
<p>“I think she is,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Tristan said, “I don’t know what you guys talked about, but I discussed this with the others, and I have an idea what they probably said. Do you know how many appointments and meetings she goes to?”</p>
<p>“It came up,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Okay, good. But did you talk about <em>why?</em>”</p>
<p>“Because she needs careful handling?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because,” Tristan said, “She’s a special case. She’s not the original Ashley, I’m not sure if you picked up on that.”</p>
<p>“I got the gist of it.”</p>
<p>“Like she said, her memories aren’t hers. She was cloned, they took her and they made up composite memories, but they had no reason to give her those fuzzy memories of other, nonconfrontational stuff. That wasn’t Bonesaw’s work. It’s the agent.”</p>
<p>I drew in a breath and I sighed.</p>
<p>“The world ended, and it ended because of <em>them</em>. We can’t have a sit-down talk with Scion because we killed him. We have a shitton of questions and the only kinds of people who can answer them are the people who got <em>really</em> close to the agents, like Bonesaw, who made Ashley&mdash;”</p>
<p>I felt a chill.</p>
<p>“&mdash;and the people like this. Who are very little of the human, shadows of the human, and a lot of the agent. All of us have problems, and a big part of those problems are the agents, handling their side of things. I know I’ve talked to Rain about this, I don’t know about the rest of you guys, but when I’m talking to her I’m also talking to the agent that’s very close to the surface. I feel like if I can get along with that agent, I can get along with mine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I want to get along with the human,” Sveta said. “I don’t want to define her as the monstrous half.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair too,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I folded my arms. I looked down at Chris, and I saw that he was half-asleep.</p>
<p>He saw me looking, and he said, “The world was invaded by aliens. People don’t know it, we don’t like to think about it, but they’re here, they’re a part of things. Getting along with the most accessible of them makes sense.”</p>
<p>I didn’t like it, but I wasn’t sure how to articulate it. My own agent had a hand in my life. It was the wretch, the sapience behind the forcefield. I had seen what Amy’s had done to her.</p>
<p>Thinking too hard about it stirred up countless ugly feelings, and those feelings choked out and clouded the words I wanted to articulate.</p>
<p>“Let’s leave them be,” Rain said. “Let’s assume we’re not going to have our second exercise, and walk me through how things went.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>As the discussion continued, I didn’t take my eyes off the pair in the distance.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap30">Glare &mdash; 3.4</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Kenzie sprinted toward the wall, and took a flying kick at it. The wall broke, split at a diagonal, the upper half sliding down the split until the corner stabbed the ground. Kenzie backed up swiftly before the section of wall toppled and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“I’m clearly the strongest member of the team,” she said.</p>
<p>“You’re the lamest,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Can I try it again?” Kenzie asked, ignoring Chris. “Rain?”</p>
<p>“Be careful,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I will. I want to test stuff. Can I try it again?”</p>
<p>Rain stood from the rock he was sitting on, and held one hand out to the side. The silver-white blade he created had a slight crescent shape to it. He swung his arm and threw it, for lack of a better word. It traced an arc, more a boomerang in flight than an arrow or thrown weapon, and cut deep into the wall that Tristan had left as a permanent fixture. A silver-white line was left along the length of the wall.</p>
<p>Kenzie raised her flash gun, and she shot the wall. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>She approached the wall, and she had her eyehook snake out from where it was attached to her belt, pincers open, slapping against the wall. She pushed with the eyehook.</p>
<p>“Hurry,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Kenzie continued using the eyehook to push, to no avail. She moved the hook around to the wall’s edge, grabbed the length of the eyehook, and pulled, adding her strength to the mechanical arm’s.</p>
<p>Stone slid easily against stone, and the wall was pulled down, cleanly cut where the silver line had been drawn.</p>
<p>“I could do this all day,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad power,” I said.</p>
<p>“I never said it was bad,” Rain said. He sat back down. “It’s mediocre. On certain days, it’s a little better.”</p>
<p>“Better how? Size, speed, effectiveness, number you can throw?”</p>
<p>“All of the above, except maybe effectiveness. And duration, I’d say. Ten, twenty percent increase, if I had to guess.”</p>
<p>“Duration?”</p>
<p>“How long after I shoot stuff the line lasts.”</p>
<p>I turned to my laptop and I started typing that up.</p>
<p>“Not effectiveness?” Kenzie asked, as she rejoined us. She had her phone out and walked without looking where she was going.</p>
<p>Sveta and Tristan were having a conversation off to one side, Ashley had gone back to the library to use the washroom, which had freed Kenzie to rejoin us, and Chris was getting dressed again while under the cover of the giant-size shorts.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of one thing or the other,” Rain said. “Either it breaks or it doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking at the data from my eyehook,” Kenzie said. “It didn’t work with your power until after I started helping it. Twenty point two pounds of force total, that’s nine point one six kilograms, and then the break happened. What if it’s easier to break things when your power is better?”</p>
<p>“It could be,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It’s good thinking,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie nodded, eyes still on her phone, and said, “Can you throw another?”</p>
<p>“More tests?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“No. Breaking stuff like this is a ton of fun,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Rain stood, looked around, and then created another blade of silver-white light. He threw it at the half-stick Chris had left impaled in the hillside. The blade passed through the dead-tree stick, leaving a white line in it a good few feet above the ground, and continued forward as two separate segments flying in parallel, with a narrow gap in the middle. One hit a tree, and the other hit the ground.</p>
<p>Kenzie ran off, handing her phone to her eyehook.</p>
<p>“What happens if you hit a person?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I tried on livestock, a goat. Silver line.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“The goat ran off, jumped up onto a tractor tire, then jumped down. The impact as she jumped down was what did it. Clean cut.”</p>
<p>“Possibly over twenty pounds of force in that impact?”</p>
<p>“I guess,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Kenzie had reached the rod and found the silver line was higher than she could reach. She began rolling a nearby rock closer, to give herself a leg up.</p>
<p>Chris, barefoot, wearing his t-shirt and shorts, broke into a sprint. As Kenzie climbed up onto the rock, Chris threw himself at the rod, hard, body-checking it. It broke in two at the silver line, the top half toppling.</p>
<p>Kenzie made the kind of high-pitched noise only a prepubescent girl could, and drew her flash gun. She began shooting Chris repeatedly, while he rolled in the grass, laughing, arms around his face.</p>
<p>“What happens when you hit the ground?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not much, most of the time. I guess you get a fissure, but it doesn’t really do much, because the line is so clean.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie!” I called out.</p>
<p>She stopped shooting Chris and turned to look.</p>
<p>“Stomp on the line on the ground? I’m curious!”</p>
<p>She ran off, leaving Chris where he was.</p>
<p>“Can you explain the schedule, then? The powers wax and wane?”</p>
<p>Rain sighed.</p>
<p>“Sorry, if I’m grilling you a little too much. I’m trying to get my head around this.”</p>
<p>“I see them in my dreams. I never get a good night’s sleep, never dream normally. Just… them. And they see me. We take turns, and when my turn comes up, I get a bit of a power up.”</p>
<p>“That’s how you knew Snag’s description, before you knew his name.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>Off in the distance, Kenzie stomped on the silver line in the grass. There was a bit of dust, and some grass stalks fell, but I didn’t see anything else. She looked at us and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Every five days, I get my turn, and I’m a little bit stronger. There are other times I’m stronger, but it’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Every five? There’s four others?”</p>
<p>“Three others,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“What’s…?”</p>
<p>“The day in the rotation after me, it’s a blank space. My running theory is that there was a fifth member of the cluster, but they died before the powers set in. Free power-up, goes to someone random. Doesn’t always line up with our power, so on those days, I can sometimes have more tinker power, or more mover power, more emotion power. A taste of what I could be.”</p>
<p>“Once every twenty days, on average.”</p>
<p>“Never lining up with my days,” he said. He sighed. “Through the dreams I’ve seen them unmasked and they’ve seen me. They hate me and I’m not overly fond of them. They’re always there, every night, and it’s pretty obvious how much they despise me. It’s where Tristan and I have that shared experience, kind of.”</p>
<p>“People you can’t get away from,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about your cluster?” Tristan asked, joining the conversation. Sveta was behind him.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Tristan sat down on the rock beside Rain. I scooted over so Sveta could sit beside me.</p>
<p>“These people want you dead? How likely is it they go forward with this hit?”</p>
<p>“Ninety-nine point eight percent likely,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“What’s the point two?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“They all die or get arrested before they get around to it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You seem pretty cavalier about traveling into the city,” I said. “You caught a train today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. “Again, it’s the dreams, I can pick up a little, and I can throw them off a little. The thing about being outnumbered in this situation is that I have a lot of opportunities to pick up details. One clue from any of them can help a lot.”</p>
<p>“Details like?”</p>
<p>“The woman is injured, and Snag wants to repair the arm you trashed. That buys me a few days. So, uh, thank you.”</p>
<p>“The third one won’t come after you alone?”</p>
<p>“He’s a guy, a little older than me. Glasses. He’s the person with the tinker power. I haven’t picked up much about him, but he doesn’t interact with people much. Less than Snag or the woman, and Snag is an asshole and the woman is mute, so that should tell you something.”</p>
<p>“There’s an advantage in that,” Tristan said. “If they aren’t socially adroit and you are&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You’re better off than they are and that counts for something,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“They have money and resources, and that more than makes up for it,” Rain said. He looked at me. “We’re suspicious they hired Tattletale to track me down.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said. I thought about that. “I honestly can’t think of someone worse to have on your trail.”</p>
<p>“She’s good enough to take over a city and get away with it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“That’s not even it,” I said. “She <em>destroys</em> people.”</p>
<p>“Are we talking about group members behind their backs?” Kenzie asked, as she joined us.</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said. “We’re talking Tattletale.”</p>
<p>Over near the staff that had been made with the dead tree, Chris was lying in the grass, arms and legs spread, staring up at the sky.</p>
<p>“He’s okay?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He’s fine,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>As if responding, Chris chuckled to himself, lying in the grass near the base of the hill.</p>
<p>“The Undersiders took over Brockton Bay, and they did it with Tattletale on point for most of it. I’m not a hundred percent sure on any of this, but you can look at the events in the city starting with her taking power. Bank robbery, Undersiders succeed, they run into the Wards, me, and my sister. Tattletale insinuates knowledge of my sister’s deepest secrets, and mine. My sister goes off the deep end. ABB are provoked following an arrest of their leader and an interaction with the Undersiders, with Tattletale. They’re toppled with a concerted effort on the part of the villains, with intel passed to the heroes by the villains.”</p>
<p>“By Tattletale,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“In large part. Empire Eighty-Eight get outed, secret identities revealed. Undersiders are the focus of the blame, and a number of people die in the ensuing rampage. Weeks and months of violence and chaos in Brockton Bay feed into the Endbringer attack on the city. Half of my family died because of that.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I reached out for her hand and gave it a waggle. “It should be noted that in the hospital after the attack, Tattletale talked to the leaders of various hero teams about Leviathan’s strengths and weaknesses. Info that was then used to beat down Behemoth enough to let Scion finish him off.”</p>
<p>“That could be a coincidence,” Rain said.</p>
<p>He didn’t say it in a dismissive way. He said it like he was a little scared, and he wanted something to cling to.</p>
<p>I wanted to drive reality home, though. Better to scare him and have him alive than the alternative.</p>
<p>“Possibly. But I’m more inclined to see her as a force multiplier or a kind of thinker version of what you do with your power, creating weak points for others to capitalize on. We see a lot of these coincidences. After the Endbringer, the Slaughterhouse Nine visit and do a hell of a lot of damage, but they also lose several key members. The weaknesses of several key members are revealed and the members are removed.”</p>
<p>“You might want to go easy on talking about those guys when Ashley gets back,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “It’s just one data point in a series. The last remaining mastermind of the city falls, Coil. The PRT directors die. Twice, in quick succession. Weaknesses are targeted and capitalized on. <em>Alexandria</em> dies in Brockton Bay, at the hands of a girl who had apparently wanted to be a hero, but who was converted to the villains’ side. Flechette, a hero, a minor friend of mine? Apparently converted. Accord edges into the Undersiders’ turf. He dies when the Behemoth fight happens. What do you think happens with his resources and power? Because I’m betting it’s the same as what happened with Coil’s.”</p>
<p>“And now she runs one of the major settlement points,” Rain said. He still sounded spooked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I don’t have all of the information, but she got to that point by being one of the masterminds and playing the game well. She was aggressive when the city was vulnerable and she was passive when it wasn’t. The moment Gold Morning came around, I get the impression she mobilized hard, she was ready to expand and capitalize on the situation with more of that aggression. Again, I’m not 100% on all of that. But I can say with reasonable confidence that she’s one of the most dangerous, capable people on Gimel.”</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do, then?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>
<p>Sveta elbowed me. “You have to give him more than that. You can’t scare him and not give him something.”</p>
<p>“Please,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I thought for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“She bleeds,” I said. “She gets tired, and she looked really fucking tired when I saw her. She has a lot on her plate, and I don’t think you’re a primary focus. Which is good. You don’t want to be her primary focus, because people who are tend to end up in pieces, one way or another.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Rain said, sounding anything but.</p>
<p>“She…” I started. I bit my tongue.</p>
<p>“What?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to jump to conclusions. I don’t want to give you the wrong impressions, either.”</p>
<p>“Any impressions help,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “But what she said when I talked to her, the way she wanted to make herself out to be one of the good guys, bringing good things to others…”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Kenzie said. She fiddled with her phone.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t necessarily jibe with her working with people who are out for blood and murder. She seems to want to be a very low-key villain or even a Robin-Hood type desperado while simultaneously leaving a trail of bodies in her wake, or she wants to portray herself as such,” I said.</p>
<p><em>“I’m now sharing the love and bringing some of that security, stability, and safety to others, in my very, very roundabout way,”</em> Kenzie’s phone said, in Tattletale’s voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s it, thank you,” I said. Kenzie gave me a thumbs up. I felt a bit of the heebie-jeebies at having heard Tattletale’s voice without being braced for it. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts before I added, “It makes me wonder what she would say if she were told that Snag and the other two were out for your head.”</p>
<p>“She could be full of shit,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“She could be,” I admitted. “Trouble of dealing with masterminds is you can’t ever know.”</p>
<p>“Makes me think,” Tristan said. “We really should have that talk about our group’s game plan.”</p>
<p>“We can’t have that talk without Ashley,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Or Chris,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned to look at Chris, before giving us a very unenthused, “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Pretty quick turnaround on your opinion of Chris,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s not turned around. It’s a love-hate relationship,” Kenzie said. “Sometimes I really like him and sometimes I really don’t. Right now is one of those times I really don’t. I was having fun.”</p>
<p>“There will be other times you can fool around with my power, and with others,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Kenzie said. She looked at Rain and smiled. “We’re gonna help you with your thing.”</p>
<p>A bit of a non-sequitur, but I wasn’t going to draw attention to it. “Do you want to call Ashley or see what’s holding her up? If she’s not up to having this conversation, that’s okay too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll call her,” Kenzie said, hopping up from her seat. She wandered off, her eyehook holding her phone to her ear.</p>
<p>“I’ll get Chris,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>As Sveta vacated the space on the bench to my left, I turned to the laptop to my right. I typed up a few things about Rain’s power, then paged up and down some to look at the entries for the individual powers. There was a lot more to write up before I had an actual outline I could pitch to the Wardens. If they were even interested in working with the overarching cape community on that level.</p>
<p>I hoped they were. The villains had a lot of advantages, from the fact they often had the initiative to the fact that their work often made money, and the fact that the chaos and damage they wrought often created more opportunities, henchmen, and money for them. Heroes who did well, conversely, often put themselves out of work.</p>
<p>One of the few advantages our side had was that the heroes tended to work together. If we did it right, we walked away with allies. I had people like Gilpatrick, Crystal, and Mrs. Yamada.</p>
<p>“How’s Erin?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“She’s good. She’s applying for jobs today. We’re in an awkward spot for it, though, not many locations, a lot of people around our age want those jobs, and it’s a long drive in to get to work. I think those places open at six. It might mean waking up at four to get to work on time.”</p>
<p>Sveta dragged Chris to the collection of rocks, benches, and seats. Chris climbed up to his seat, sitting on the rock Kenzie had been using. I was pretty clear he was still blind, from the way he stared off into space.</p>
<p>“There are times I don’t get to sleep until four,” Chris said, talking to the open air.</p>
<p>“That’s not good,” Sveta said. “Don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“It’s a chance to be independent,” Tristan said. “If she can get the job. She gives off a good impression, so I can imagine it happening.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Who is she?” I asked. “Can I ask?”</p>
<p>“Just a friend,” Rain said. “I’ve always grown up in the middle of nowhere, so when my family was getting settled after Gold Morning, we saw all the incentives they were offering to people willing to get a headstart on agriculture and it seemed natural, you know?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>“Erin’s parents were kind of the opposite. City people through and through, something in them broke after Gold Morning. They couldn’t bring themselves to join the rat race again, I think. They were given the option for the simple life and they took it. Erin got dragged with.”</p>
<p>“And you connected.”</p>
<p>“She was having a hard time, because y’know, she stands out when a lot of people are hurt and angry and looking to lash out. She went looking for a hiding place and she stumbled on my workshop. She’s been a real help, from before I even had the therapy, helping me get figured out, listening to me, helping me research. I… don’t really know what she gets out of the deal, from me.”</p>
<p>“I can think of a few things she gets from you,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I appreciate you saying that, I’m not sure I see it though,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I saw Kenzie react to Ashley’s appearance before I saw Ashley. She made her way up the less sloped side of the hill, holding a pair of water bottles.</p>
<p>“Having a friend with powers is pretty neat,” I said to Rain.</p>
<p>“Yeah. For sure,” he said.</p>
<p>“And while I don’t know you that well, you seem very thoughtful.”</p>
<p>“And there’s the brooding, mysterious part of it,” Kenzie said. “Girls like that. You and Chris are similar like that.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Rain said. He frowned a bit.</p>
<p>“I’m picturing the expression on your face,” Chris said, before laughing.</p>
<p>“How long’s he going to be blind?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Could be ten minutes, could be an hour or two,” Kenzie said, as she skip-walked over to sit down at Ashley’s side as Ashley took her seat.</p>
<p>An hour or two?</p>
<p>“You got anywhere to be, Chris?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No family, nobody that cares that much,” he said. “I’m one of the lost boys, living in the institution.”</p>
<p>“I know what that’s like,” Kenzie said. “The institution. It’s not fun.”</p>
<p>“Personally? I don’t give a shit, and they don’t give a shit about me, I could disappear tomorrow and nobody would blink.”</p>
<p>“We’d blink,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You would,” Chris said. “But you’re lame like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear about your situation,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>fine</em>,” Chris said, with emphasis, still staring off into space. Blindly, he rummaged in one pocket, pulling out a plastic kit. “It’s&mdash; it’s freeing. All I care about is that I eat three square meals, since nourishment matters for my power, and having a place to sleep. Strip away everything else, and it’s all any of us want.”</p>
<p>“Some of us want people to keep close to us,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Not me,” Chris said. He opened the kit and drew out a pair of pliers.</p>
<p>“Your opinions may change as you hit puberty,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’m already started on that, I’m not going to go into any details, and I really don’t think my feelings are going to change,” Chris replied. He seemed to reconsider, then said, “I really hope they don’t.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Ashley. She’d been quiet since sitting down. The last time I’d reached out hadn’t ended well. Was I supposed to ignore her now, leave her alone while she wound herself down?</p>
<p>“How about we talk about your idea, Tristan?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It’s getting later in the afternoon,” Sveta said. “And Kenzie has dinner with her parents. It would be good to get it out of the way.”</p>
<p>“I can skip it if I have to,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t,” I said.</p>
<p>Tristan shifted position, metal sliding against smooth stone. “The plan. We’ve only got the broad strokes worked out, so if you want to help hammer it out, Victoria, it would really help.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Protecting Rain in the coming weeks is essential. My starting point for thinking about this plan was thinking how we might cover all the bases we want to cover. We need to keep the older members of the group free enough to help Rain with whatever he needs help with. Kenzie wants to do something integral to the group, and while she can help keep an eye out, it’s easy for her to take too much of a backseat role.”</p>
<p>“Am I taking a frontseat role then?”</p>
<p>“I’m&mdash; not exactly. There’s a lot about this that’s counterintuitive. My first instinct is to think, hey, I want to make money, I want to be out there doing things. But that leaves us open to interference and distraction. So… what if we go covert?”</p>
<p>“Covert?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nobody knows Ashley is on the side of the good guys for the time being. She’s really good at the villainous persona and atmosphere.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“And then there’s Chris, who can be monstrous, appear, disappear, then show up again as someone or something else.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Chris. Chris had two sets of pliers in his mouth. He was readjusting his braces.</p>
<p>“The masterminds and the organizations are masterminding and getting organized. Hollow Point is one example of that, and Tattletale’s degree of involvement, that’s another example. I didn’t get the impression Tattletale was really aware that we were a team, so I think this works.”</p>
<p>“Take all things mastermind with a grain of salt,” I said.</p>
<p>“Of course,” Tristan said, quickly enough that I wondered if he’d bothered with that grain of salt. “Okay, so what if we do like&mdash; actually, it’s like Victoria was saying a few minutes ago, about creating and capitalizing on weak points&mdash;”</p>
<p>“She was telling us more about Tattletale,” Kenzie told Ashley.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said. “Look, no rush, we do this slow and careful. We put you guys out there, Ashley and Chris can plant cameras, Kenzie handles backend, we gather all the data we can, and we find out what the masterminds are doing and where the organizations are most vulnerable.”</p>
<p>“Then we hit them,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Tristan said. “<em>Maybe</em>. We assess the situation, we maybe even spread disinformation, and then we have discussions, involving other cape teams, maybe. If it seems doable, we hit them. We have a lot going for us if we want to blitz the enemy or ruin a plan in progress. When it’s time to make our play, we can do big, we can hit hard, and we can move fast. If it doesn’t seem doable, we sell the info to another cape team.”</p>
<p>“I like that you’re thinking about the money,” I said. “How do you sustain things if you’re going ahead and handling the mission on your own?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking we don’t,” Tristan said. “I’m not wanting to set up a headquarters, we wouldn’t necessarily have employees or staff, we can figure something out for costume.”</p>
<p>“It’s a long, hard road to gather that kind of intel and then act on it at just the right time. It’s a test of patience,” I said. “That patience gets tested further when your pockets are empty.”</p>
<p>“I hear you,” Tristan said. “It helps some that we have a lot of people here who are subsidized or not entirely out on their own. Kenzie gets money from her parents, Chris has his meals and shelter through the institution.</p>
<p>“I think we have an advantage there,” Sveta said, quiet. “Because the thing that defines us, and I don’t think it defined the Irregulars like this, and it didn’t define the Wards, like Weld described them… we all <em>need</em> to be out there. We <em>need</em> this. That makes us stick it out.”</p>
<p>There were nods around the group. Even Chris. The heads that weren’t nodding were smiling, like Ashley’s, or looking very serious in a way that made me sure they were in agreement, like Rain was.</p>
<p>I allowed myself to nod as well.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “I might be able to make some recommendations about funding, so you won’t be too starved. If you think you can gather intel that others might be interested in, I can talk to other teams on your behalf, or I can point you in the right direction if you want to handle that yourselves. You’d tell them you have the capacity to get intel. You may or may not want first dibs on these villains, but whatever happens, if they’ll pay a token amount, you’ll give up the info. It serves a double purpose if you set it up as a dead man’s switch. Worst comes to worst, the authorities get an email letting them know what you were up to and who you were up against.”</p>
<p>“They’d pay for that, you think?” Rain asked. “Even if it’s us saying we’re taking first dibs, but we’ll give the info anyway?”</p>
<p>“I think it could be sold to them,” I said. “Information comes at a premium, and every single team out there is wanting as clear a picture of where things stand as possible.”</p>
<p>“I do my thing, Chris does his thing, Kenzie does her thing,” Ashley said. “Sveta, Tristan and I help Rain in the meantime. When we have the intel, we hit them. Take out key players, interfere with a key part of their business, and we leave them ruined.”</p>
<p>“We <em>maybe</em> hit them,” Tristan said, with emphasis on ‘maybe’.</p>
<p>“If we spend the time to get that far, you’ll be itching to see it the rest of the way through,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“And then what?” I asked, before they could get in an argument.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Let’s assume it’s a success, or you hand off the intel. What follows?”</p>
<p>“Depends on a lot of factors,” Tristan said. “We could take another piece of data collected on the way and jump off from there, or we don’t just take money, and we go to another team and we trade intel for intel. They tell us if they’ve got more tough nuts or tricky areas to tackle, and we use that as our next starting point.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I… admit this makes a lot of sense. It may be harder than you’re picturing. Masterminds cover their asses, organizations have a lot of tools at their disposal.”</p>
<p>“If we get six pieces of a twenty-piece puzzle and we realize we can’t take things any further, we can still sell that intel,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,’ I said. ”I’m trying to think about how that plays out in the long-term.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Tristan said. “There’s the stuff I just said, but I was mostly thinking about the next few steps. I’d rather make calls based on the now and adapt later, depending on what comes up.”</p>
<p>“That’s fair,” I said. “I’m trying to be mindful of consequences, these days. You’d be making enemies, once people realized what you were doing and the role you’d played. If you’re not careful, Ashley and Chris as background observers are cards you can only play a few times, in a limited fashion.”</p>
<p>“You can play me eight times,” Chris said, pulling the pliers out of his mouth, “After that they’ll probably catch on.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t change your head that much, then they’ll catch on sooner than that,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“On that topic, I’m not sure I like Chris being out in the field like that,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Chris said. “I can handle that much.”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking Chris gets involved as a distraction. A few minutes at a time, a monster shows up, overturns the status quo. The kind of thing we do once every two weeks or once a month.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m good with that,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I like it,” Rain said. “I hate that I’m a burden at this stage.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” Kenzie said. She reached out to give Rain a pat on the knee with her eyehook. “We’re all burdens in our own screwed up ways.”</p>
<p>My expression might have betrayed something, because Tristan looked my way.</p>
<p>“Yea or nay?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It reminds me of the Las Vegas capes,” I said. “And a bit of Watchdog.”</p>
<p>“Is that a bad thing?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Las Vegas had been damned effective, as had Watchdog. But where Las Vegas had been a subtle, careful player with a few questionable, mysterious individuals in their ranks making the most of their backgrounds and skills, much like this team in disposition and direction, they’d also been a team that had turned villain at a critical time. Watchdog had been careful and scrupulous, making measured moves with the best intel and agents they had at their disposal, and Watchdog hadn’t survived Gold Morning as an organization.</p>
<p>Those were the only two data points I had, for teams like this. Corruption and annihilation.</p>
<p>I couldn’t say for sure that it was a bad thing, but I couldn’t say it was a good thing either.</p>
<p>“It’s a thing,” I said.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap31">Glare &mdash; 3.5</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>The van bobbed with the added weight as I set Kenzie’s projector-recorder box down. As I moved back, I nearly tripped over Kenzie, who had climbed into the van right behind me.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the straps, I’ll tie it down,” she said. “Thank you for doing the heavy lifting. It really helps.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said. I squeezed past her and climbed down from the back of the van. “For the future, if I’m using my strength, you probably want to keep more of a distance. I wouldn’t want to bump into you with my power up.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>With Tristan having laid out his plan, the meeting was done, Tristan’s creations had been dismantled, the rocky walls and barriers broken down and placed with other rocks, and I had my laptop with my gathered notes in my bag.</p>
<p>Kenzie’s dad was standing by the door to the van. The others were gathered on the sidewalk in front of the library.</p>
<p>“Are you going to be okay going home alone?” Tristan asked Rain.</p>
<p>“If you’d asked me earlier, I’d have said yes. I’m less sure now,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said.</p>
<p>“No need to be.”</p>
<p>“I want you to know what you’re up against. I didn’t do it to scare you, exactly.”</p>
<p>“Knowing what I’m up against and being scared go hand-in-hand,” Rain said. “Right now I’m telling myself we don’t think Tattletale is free enough to be tracking me down right now, and the others are injured or preoccupied. I’m probably safe to get home like this, right?”</p>
<p>“I’d think so,” Sveta said. “I’d offer to come with you, but it’s a bit of a long trip.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. “I wouldn’t want you to go to that trouble, either way.”</p>
<p>“Have you given any thought to moving?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Rain shrugged. “Every day. Being where I am is tolerable for now, I think. The commute to the city is a pain, but if I imagine they’re hiring a dozen mercenaries and a few others, then it could be a bigger pain for them.”</p>
<p>“Hey Flays-Alive-Man, for this job, we’re going to need you and your ten superpowered friends to catch a train and spend three and a half hours traveling to the middle of nowhere, and then you have to find our target,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“God,” Rain said. “Don’t fire up my imagination with names like that.”</p>
<p>“I do want to focus more on your situation,” I said. “We’ve talked about the team and what the group is doing, but your situation is pressing. We can’t keep assuming they’re preoccupied.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“We should figure something out, cover any surprises in the short-term while plotting out something workable in the long-term,” I said.</p>
<p>“I agree. You can send them the wrong signals, but they could try tripping you up too,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I know, really,” Rain said. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, like he was about to say something, then said, “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I could come with and fly back, or fly over the train and keep an eye out for trouble,” I said.</p>
<p>I could see Rain’s reaction, the kneejerk resistance.</p>
<p>“Oh! I have cameras,” Kenzie said, “And you could use them to communicate. They’re not too obvious.”</p>
<p>“I could carry a camera,” Rain said. “Just so long as I could turn it off when I need to.”</p>
<p>“Why would you need to turn it off?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Because I have to go to the bathroom sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Why would anyone use a camera to watch someone go to the bathroom?” Kenzie asked. “No, wait, I don’t want to know. I’ve learned my lesson about those sorts of questions. But you can trust me, that’s not what I’m about.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad. I still want an off switch.”</p>
<p>Kenzie rummaged in the back of the van and pulled out a bag. She handed over something looked like a smoke detector in brushed black metal, with a lens in the center. “Here. A camera. You can press down on the lens in the middle and it will alert me. I’ll set it up so it lets the others know too, but I can pick up sound and visuals and pass it on to the others if you need it. This is the battery pack. You can pull it out and the camera won’t work.”</p>
<p>“Seems simple enough.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you do,” Kenzie said, reaching out to touch Rain’s forearm. “Do <em>not</em> put the battery pack in backward, when you re-insert it.”</p>
<p>Rain looked down at the camera he held with a little bit of trepidation.</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because then it won’t work,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You said it in an ominous voice,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“It’ll help Rain to remember not to put it in backward. Duh.”</p>
<p>“It’s not going to misfire or blow up?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Why do you keep asking that? <em>No.</em>  It’s a <em>camera.</em> There is a very small chance of it blowing up, and if it does then it’s going to be a very small explosion. Unless you’re very unlucky and a lot of the things that could make it blow up all happen at once.”</p>
<p>“I guess I trust your tech more than I trust the people who are after me to leave me alone,” Rain said. He held up the camera. “I’ll hold onto this, then. Thanks.”</p>
<p>“Cool,” Kenzie said. “You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to be looking through it and checking in on me at random, right?”</p>
<p>“Not if you don’t want me to,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to,” Rain said. “No offense. It’s just that the less you know, the less likely it is that one of the people after me decides to come after one of you to try to get info.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Kenzie said. “Not a problem.”</p>
<p><em>It’s a bit of a problem</em>, I thought. <em>But not like you’re imagining</em>.</p>
<p>Kenzie looked back toward her dad. “And I should go. You know how to get in contact if you have questions. Do you want a ride? Does anyone?”</p>
<p>“No thanks,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Kenzie double and triple checked with the rest of us, then looked over at her dad, who was waiting with barely any change in expression. “I’m going to head out then. Bye guys.”</p>
<p>“Bye,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Talk to you again soon,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie climbed into the passenger seat. Her dad glanced over the group, briefly making eye contact with me, before taking a seat behind the wheel. She stuck her hand out the window to give us a bit of a wave as her dad pulled away.</p>
<p>“Most uncomfortable car ride,” Rain said, watching them go.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Julien Martin, giving me a ride earlier. Kenzie sent me a text letting me know he was on his way to pick me up. I would have said no if she’d asked beforehand. He turned up, let me into the car, then the entire way here, didn’t say a single word. I didn’t say a thing either.”</p>
<p>“Am I missing context?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It’s context for Kenzie to share,” Sveta said, her voice firm.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said, again.</p>
<p>“Fair,” I said, even though I wasn’t sure it was. Not a hundred percent. There was a point where I couldn’t do everything I needed to do if people were keeping secrets. I didn’t want to press any buttons or tread on anything sensitive, and there were a lot of buttons and a lot of sensitive points.</p>
<p>“We’ll get you up to speed soon,” Sveta said. “But we have to be fair.”</p>
<p>“Out of curiosity, Sveta, how much wear and tear did your body take out there? Or is it bad of me to ask?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad at all,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to armor and costumes. I listened with one ear, but my thoughts were on Sveta’s defense of Kenzie’s background, and how careful Tristan was in asking about Sveta’s body.</p>
<p>There was something I’d noticed with the group, and it was something I’d fallen prey to myself. When the group was talking, it was almost always in a guarded way. Even Chris did it to a small degree. Ashley too. Conversations were meted out with care, not necessarily so each person was protecting themselves, but so they protected each other. We often slipped back into talking like we were in therapy.</p>
<p>There were cases where individuals protected themselves and cases where individuals were also protected by others. Kenzie had a role as the baby of the team, in a way. There were things she didn’t disclose and things she was intentionally or unintentionally coy about, despite her overly open personality. That was compounded by how others were ready to step up for her and defend her. That was the security they’d given her.</p>
<p>I glanced over my shoulder at Ashley, who was hanging back, finishing the second of the bottles of water she’d brought back with her after going to the library. Ashley was very similar to Kenzie in that department. Unguarded in terms of how open she was about many things, but she had things she didn’t talk about, and she benefited heavily from the group’s defense of her.</p>
<p>It was the contract between them, the language they used and their habits, it carried over from the group. It was going to change over time, I was sure, especially if their therapy with Mrs. Yamada ran its course. I wasn’t sure if that meant the dialogue would become natural, if the contract would be betrayed in small ways, or both.</p>
<p>I was, as much as they’d asked for my help, the interloper. They protected each other from me, even if it meant Sveta was protecting someone as troubled as Ashley from someone she saw as a friend. I suspected it ran deeper than her wanting to see Ashley’s humanity win out over the monster.</p>
<p>Getting the information on powers and on the most important things like Ashley’s situation was easily doable, because it was need-to-know. Where I ran into a stumbling block was that their view on need-to-know and my view differed.</p>
<p>I worried they had too light a view of things. The ones who didn’t were among the more guarded, and they were being guarded too.</p>
<p>It all knotted together. Was I supposed to be patient and wait for the information to come out? Would it come out only as each crisis reared its head? Or did I push and risk doing damage?</p>
<p>I could push lightly. I waited for Tristan to stop talking about his armor, and the tools he used to fix the scuffs.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one waiting for a break in the conversation. “I should probably go or I’m going to miss my train.”</p>
<p>“My offer stands,” I said. “An eye in the sky, if you think you’ll need it.”</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. “I’d rather&mdash;”</p>
<p>He stopped at that.</p>
<p>“What?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Rain went on, “It’s my experience that when you’re in trouble, people are usually pretty good about offering help and support. People are good like that. I’ve seen it with family members that had babies, and people who lost loved ones. Everyone turns up and offers their support, they bring food, they say they’ll be there. And they are, at first.”</p>
<p>“You think we’ll get bored of this and not help you later?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Not bored,” Rain said. “Shit happens. Everyone has their issues, things come up, and then they lose sight of the promises made to new parents, the bereaved, or whoever else.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s pretty unfair,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“It’s reality,” Rain said. He looked at me, “It’s nice of you to offer, Victoria, but I’d rather have you come and keep an eye on things when I feel like I’m actually in danger, instead of coming now, realizing what a huge pain in the ass it is to fly that far out of your way, and then feeling reluctant when it counts.”</p>
<p>I thought about reassuring him, pointing out that I’d traveled from the Bridgeport span to the portal in New Haven to Brockton Bay, several times a week, to get notes, check on the wreckage of the house and visit Crystal’s family. I didn’t.</p>
<p>“Gotcha,” I said. I’d pushed, I wasn’t going to push harder now that the boundary had been raised.</p>
<p>“You’re still blind, Chris?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Yep. It’s starting to come back, though. Thirty minutes to an hour, I think.”</p>
<p>“Do you want someone to stay with you?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“No. Hell no. Then I’d feel obligated to make conversation and shit,” Chris said. “It’s a sunny day, there’s a breeze, the weather is perfect. I’m going to sit outside and wait and then I’ll make my way back to the institution.”</p>
<p>“They won’t be bothered if you’re late for dinner?” I asked.</p>
<p>“So long as I’m there by lights out, they don’t care. They’ve got twenty staff and over a thousand kids in the building with dead or missing parents. I eat or I feed myself, I mostly do the chores I’m assigned, I’m there when I’m supposed to be. There’s lots of others who demand more attention than I do.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like the children at your institution are pretty vulnerable,” Sveta said. “Nobody paying attention to what they’re doing with their days. Any of you could be pressed into work or preyed on or you could end up disappearing, and nobody would know.”</p>
<p>“Not me,” Chris said. “They’d regret it if they tried with me. With triggers being a thing, they might regret it whoever they try it with.”</p>
<p>I was put in mind of my mom. “It doesn’t mean the damage isn’t done before powers come into the picture.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I dunno,” Chris said. “I’m going to relax and wait until my vision comes back. If it takes too long or if I run into trouble, I’ve got another change I was wanting to make today. Keen Vigilance. Perception focused. It’ll give me a fresh set of eyes.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>The others got themselves sorted out. Rain, Sveta, and Tristan started their walk to the train station. Chris retreated toward the library.</p>
<p>Ashley remained by the sidewalk, drinking her water. She’d been dead quiet.</p>
<p>“You good?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“I was dead for years. I’ve been operated on, feeling every last movement of the scalpel, several times. This is nothing, so yeah, I’m <i>good</i>.”</p>
<p>She put a curious inflection on the word.</p>
<p>It was eerie to think of Bonesaw’s involvement in things. Her handling of Ashley here, how the Slaughterhouse Nine had got Blasto which had led to Fume Hood’s downward spiral. It made me think of Crawler, and it made me think of what had happened to my home town.</p>
<p>To my home, my living room shattered with monsters left lying in places where childhood memories were supposed to be. Monsters that had once been people, a few of them genuinely good and decent.</p>
<p>Heroes, even.</p>
<p>To my family. To the person who had once been closest to me.</p>
<p>“Right. Good to hear,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re similar, I think,” she said.</p>
<p>I paused. I’d been taking a second to think about how I would gracefully exit. Now I was left to process what she’d said, and figure out how to gracefully answer that.</p>
<p>“Should I take that as a compliment?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Take it however you like. Them? They’ve experienced hurt. They’ve known horror. Maybe not so much for Kenzie, but she experienced enough hurt that it balances out.”</p>
<p>“I probably shouldn’t be hearing this,” I said.</p>
<p>“They haven’t seen the worst of it. They haven’t seen rock bottom and then had someone or something reach up from below and drag them <em>deeper</em>. The Slaughterhouse Nine were that for me. I got the impression from how you talked about Tattletale that she was that for you.”</p>
<p><em>No,</em> I thought. <em>Only in small part</em>.</p>
<p>“My first take on you was that you knew enough to be useful. Then you talked about Tattletale, and your reaction to someone who has the information, who’s careful, and who has resources? You’re afraid.”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>concerned</em>,” I said.</p>
<p>“I respect it, that fear.”</p>
<p>“Concern,” I said. “If it was just fear for myself, that would be one thing. But I’m <em>concerned</em> about the others here.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very <em>concerning</em> world, isn’t it?” she asked. “There’s a lot to be concerned about. You and I, we have our eyes open about that, even if we’re taking it in very different directions.”</p>
<p>“Are we?” I asked. “Aren’t you giving this hero thing an honest shot?”</p>
<p>“I am. It’s not going to work out, but I’ll be here until the end.”</p>
<p>“You sound pretty sure about the fact that it’s going to go south.”</p>
<p>She tipped back her water bottle, finishing it off, and without even lowering the bottle from her mouth, used her power. Shorter than her prior uses, abrupt. It made its usual cacophony of noise, my ears ringing faintly in its wake, and it pushed her hair up and back, so it took a second to fall back into place.</p>
<p>She caught her balance, taking a second before she stood straight again. Then she looked at me with eyes that had no pupils, no irises, only the white, and only the dark makeup to draw out the eyelashes. Slowly, her pupils faded back in.</p>
<p>All to dispose of a water bottle, apparently, or to make a point.</p>
<p>“I’m not even the most fucked up person on this team, Victoria,” she said. “I might not even be in the top two. Our therapist knows, and that’s why she was <em>concerned</em> enough to reach out to you. They, the really fucked up ones, they probably know. But I know it too, which makes me <em>pretty</em> certain.”</p>
<p>“Yet you’re still here,” I said.</p>
<p>“So are you.”</p>
<p>“I’m cursed with an impulse to help people,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s an epidemic,” she said.</p>
<p>“Guess so,” I said. I used my flight, my feet rising an inch or two off the ground. “I think I’m going to take off.”</p>
<p>She gave me a small salute, her expression dispassionate.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to give the impression I was running, so I asked, “See you in a couple of days, then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I flew skyward, at the speed and angle that made even my stomach do that overly light flip-flop at the distance between myself and solid earth. I came to a stop when I couldn’t see the library anymore.</p>
<p>I didn’t fly home. I had too many thoughts in my head, and after seeing the others, seeing personalities and outbursts from Tristan’s comments for Byron to Ashley’s more dire threats, the powers, the secrets that were being kept or barely suppressed…</p>
<p>I remained in the air, the ground a blur beneath me, the clouds not all that far above me. The city was painted in its golds, its concrete and pavement with yellow paint, its grassy patches, its fields of wheat and corn.</p>
<p>Just me up here, the wind in my ears.</p>
<p>I believed Ashley. It wasn’t that she was honest, she wasn’t. She bluffed and she bluffed often. I suspected the bluffs were because she’d been telling me the truth when she’d remarked on the common thread between us: we’d seen some of the worst the world had to offer and we had reason to be afraid.</p>
<p>I believed her when she said there were people on the team who she saw as more ‘messed up’ than herself. I had my suspicions about who.</p>
<p><em>Something</em> was up with Chris. Mentally and emotionally he was compromised. Physically, compromised. Socially, in terms of where he fit into the world, again, he was compromised. He’d almost revealed the least of himself of anyone present.</p>
<p>Rain was another issue.</p>
<p>The team supported and insulated its members, they protected one another from the interlopers and the outside stresses. There were times and places that could be good, but I could just as easily see things go in a direction where outsiders weren’t sufficiently protected from the group, while the group carried on like this.</p>
<p>My job, in a way.</p>
<p>I’d keep an eye on all of them, of course. Kenzie could be a danger, and I could see even Sveta going to a bad place, however much I liked her. Tristan was strong, and he spent half of his life locked away in a lightless, motionless prison, only a window that looked out through his brother’s eyes and listened through his brother’s ears. It would be so easy for him to go off the deep end. Ashley was unpredictable and dangerous, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Chris I could only keep an eye on. Rain&mdash;</p>
<p>I didn’t fly back to Crystal’s.</p>
<p>I flew to the train station, and I held a position where I couldn’t make out the people, but I could make out the train.</p>
<p>I was paranoid, and too many things today had prodded at my paranoia. There were many I was helpless to do much about, but I could act on these suspicions.</p>
<p>A train came, traveling west-to-east. I knew Sveta and Tristan would be boarding it. Had I been on foot, it was the one I would have caught.</p>
<p>When the other train came, traveling the opposite direction, I followed it. I had a pit in my stomach, doing it, but I had a gut feeling that this was part of why Jessica had reached out to me, and why she had been relieved that I was keeping an eye on things.</p>
<p>Yes, they knew things about each other. But they kept secrets. There were evasions, walls that were thrown up.</p>
<p>I just didn’t understand what Rain was doing. To have a hit out on his head and reject an escort, holding firm to that rejection even after having the danger driven home?</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Rain?” I asked. Where I was, suspended in the sky, wind rushing past me, there was nobody to hear.</p>
<p>I was prepared to follow him to Greenwich. It was a lengthy trip, and it left me to think about grabbing dinner, possibly on the trip back. I tempted myself with thoughts of a burger or a good souvlaki roll. Something warm, as I thought on it. This high up, there was no heat radiating up off the ground or nearby surfaces, less sunlight bouncing around with light energy dissipating and becoming heat, and the steady wind flowed past me to swipe the warmth that my body put out. As stakeouts went, this was liable to be cold, and I’d have to figure out something for bathroom breaks.</p>
<p>As self-imposed missions went, it wasn’t just hard for me to justify doing this, it was a pretty rough experience. The mind-numbing dullness of a sit-and-watch stakeout combined with the hypnotic nature of a long-distance drive. Drivers, at least, had to watch the road and be mindful of other drivers. I had nothing to help keep my thoughts centered.</p>
<p>From Stratford to Bridgeport. I had my binoculars out, and I watched for trouble, studying the people boarding the train.</p>
<p>Nothing obvious.</p>
<p>The train carried on its way, traveling from the Bridgeport neighborhood to Fairfield span, past the community center that had been attacked at Norfair, and then onward to Norwalk station. Kenzie’s neighborhood.</p>
<p>There were stops where only a pair of people left, stops where only a few got on, and Norwalk, unfortunately, was one of the major stations. I couldn’t track everyone that boarded.</p>
<p>My thoughts were preoccupied, thinking about what I was doing, my doubts, my frustration that I couldn’t effectively watch out for trouble while doing this the way I was doing it. It was too easy for someone with powers to board the train and go after Rain while uncostumed. Was it likely? No. But I wanted to justify what I was doing.</p>
<p>There was a chance, though, that when Rain got off the train, he would be followed by fellow passengers until he was in a place where he could be attacked. I could watch out for that.</p>
<p>I could watch out for any unexpected stops, and I could keep an eye out for the old staples of railway robberies and ambushes &mdash; trains moved slowest when they went around corners, so I could keep an eye out for ambushes and unexpected boardings that took place in those locations.</p>
<p>With my thoughts caught up in things as they were, I nearly missed it.</p>
<p>The train was old-fashioned in look, cars linked by couplings, and passengers could move between cars, with the space between each car being open to the air. Periodically passengers would step out to smoke or get fresh air. Most were parents with kids.</p>
<p>At the caboose, a figure had stepped out onto the back. Rain.</p>
<p>He climbed over the railing and jumped, while the train was going well over a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p>Hands out to his side, his bag in one hand, other empty, his feet touched the slope, and he stopped. No momentum, nothing to suggest he’d been on a speeding train a matter of seconds ago. The fact he stood on a slope didn’t seem to matter, as he didn’t slide, slip, or fall.</p>
<p>He looked around, but he didn’t look up, and I wasn’t sure he would have seen me if he had. He jogged down the slope, and walked across a field. Past the field was mostly wilderness and dirt road.</p>
<p>Rain walked for ten minutes to get where he was going. Erin had parked under a modest little bridge in a town with one gas station.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel good, watching them interact. I felt guilty for spying, even though his actions proved he was being dishonest. I watched Rain make conversation with his friend. Minutes, where he did most of the talking, pacing some, while Erin leaned against the side of the vehicle.</p>
<p>He must have asked something, because Erin shifted position, reaching through the window. A second later, she drew her hand out. She had a handgun.</p>
<p>It didn’t mean anything. This was justifiable, given his situation. Lying about where he lived and where he was going was justifiable. Even his friend carrying a gun made sense, when he was being hunted.</p>
<p>His story about how they met and where she came from… I wasn’t sure. It didn’t feel like I knew the whole of it.</p>
<p>If they’d traveled again, I might have watched to see where they went. If they’d gone to one of the smaller equivalents of Hollow Point, it might have told me something. If they met certain people, it might have proven out my suspicion.</p>
<p>They went to get ice cream in the dinky one gas-station town, and I couldn’t conscience staying to watch.</p>
<p>I flew home.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I let myself into Crystal’s apartment through the sliding balcony door.</p>
<p>“…ave site?” a male voice.</p>
<p>“Whenever I’m traveling in that direction,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. I keep meaning to travel out that way, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s a universe away. I can go with you sometime, if you want.”</p>
<p>“That might be nice.”</p>
<p>I shut the balcony door. I could have closed it silently, but I didn’t.</p>
<p>Crystal, standing at one corner of the living room, had the door open, but she stood in between the door and doorframe in such a way that her body filled the gap. She twisted around to look at me, and I saw a forcefield start to be painted out.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said.</p>
<p>The forcefield winked out.</p>
<p>“You sure?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>She opened the door wider. My dad was in the hallway, wearing a sleeveless top with a hood, in a very light fabric, and yoga pants of similar light weight. A gym bag sat on the floor by his feet.</p>
<p>“You’ve been flying,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s good,” he said. “That’s really positive.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” I said. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m noticing how empty my apartment feels, a lot. That’s not me trying to guilt you. It’s me realizing where I’ve wound up and wondering how I got myself here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“Do you want to invite him in?” Crystal asked. “I can fuck off if you need me to. Or you can take over door duty?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t ask you to fuck off in your own place. Are you getting tired of standing guard?” I asked.</p>
<p>“A bit.”</p>
<p>“We can invite him in.”</p>
<p>My dad entered the apartment. “Sorry to drop in.”</p>
<p>“Is that what this is?”</p>
<p>“I worry, when you drop all communication. I thought I would at least ask Crystal if you were okay.”</p>
<p>“I see,” I said. I walked around behind the couch, putting it between myself and him, and leaned forward on the back of it.</p>
<p>He took a seat on the armrest of the armchair, one foot on the ground. “I want you to know that what happened at your mom’s house, I’m sorry about that. It wasn’t right.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that. I… I wish I could tell you that I was sorry for how I reacted there. But I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t ask you to,” he said. “I think any and all of us should be understanding when it comes to old wounds.”</p>
<p><em>Old wounds</em>, I thought.</p>
<p>Were they that old? Didn’t ‘old’ presume they’d healed over or that things had been addressed or mended somehow?</p>
<p>“I guess,” I said. “What mom did, I was pretty vocal about why I was upset about it. Did Crystal explain why I was bothered by what you did?”</p>
<p>“She deflected my question when I asked.”</p>
<p>“If you noticed it was a deflection,” Crystal said, “I need to work on my patter more.”</p>
<p>“Just a bit more,” my dad said, smiling slightly.</p>
<p>“Sorry to interrupt,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said. I paused. “You realize, dad, the reason I felt betrayed wasn’t that I thought you were in on it or anything, right? I felt betrayed because you let yourself believe mom’s words more than you believed everything you saw in years of living with me, after visiting me in the asylum, after seeing how I function and how I don’t function.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to try to defend myself,” he said. “You’re absolutely right. I let myself be stupid. I have a way of doing that when I’m around your mom.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t understand how you wouldn’t just stop and realize it doesn’t make sense. When you know about the nightmares and the fact I hadn’t flown in months, and the fact I don’t even want to talk about her, you’ll believe I’d be willing to meet her face to face and have a meal?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that clear cut. Your mother is a clever woman, to the point she can outsmart herself. She has good instincts when it comes to getting people on her side, too. I’ve been missing home, the past few years, and seeing the woman I still love being warm for the first time in…”</p>
<p>He trailed off.</p>
<p>“Since twenty-eleven,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” my dad said. “With food I’ve been aching for for just as long already cooking, the kitchen and barbecue rich with that smell. Things, like I said, that make me stupid.”</p>
<p>“What food was it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Laser seared kebabs,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>I bit my lip. Family recipe. With my lip still between my teeth, I said, “Okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m not making excuses,” my dad said. “I should have clued in. When Amy turned up and I knew you were coming, it wasn’t framed like a reconciliation. It was framed as you knowing everyone was coming and you would have things to get off your chest. Carol said she would referee and I knew it would go poorly if it was just her, so I offered to help. While I was offering I wasn’t stopping to think.”</p>
<p>“Was a part of it you just wanting things to be normal again? The four person nuclear family back together?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said. “I’m not about to lie here. I&mdash; yeah. Yes.”</p>
<p>It hurt, hearing that. Knowing my dad and where he wanted to be were that far away from where I was and where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “I let my guard down when I should have had it up to protect you. I wanted you to hear that apology, and I wanted to make sure you were alright.”</p>
<p>“Crystal and I are looking after each other,” I said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>“That’s great,” my dad said.</p>
<p>I rubbed my arm, wrist to shoulder. “I’m giving some limited direction to a team of heroes right now. It’s messy.”</p>
<p>“Any team is bound to be. It’s good that you’re doing that.”</p>
<p>“Messier than most,” I said. I paused. “Top one percent of messy.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” my dad said. He rubbed his chin. It was late enough in the day that the stubble he usually had on his chin was more of a shadow. “The Dallon-Pelham family never does anything the easy way, does it?”</p>
<p>“No we don’t,” I said.</p>
<p>“Can I help?” he asked. “Advice, support? I don’t have a lot of money, but…”</p>
<p>“I’ve got the team outlined on my laptop. Six people, either under eighteen or in the vicinity of eighteen. One complicated case, age-wise. Um, this doesn’t leave this room, right?”</p>
<p>Nods from both Crystal and my dad.</p>
<p>“They’ll probably go covert. Gather and sell info. I think I can pitch that to the big teams and get the initial funding. I might be able to get costumes through them as well.”</p>
<p>“They have the infrastructure set up for costumes,” my dad said. “They’ve got most current members outfitted, and I’ve heard rumor of them branching out to supply other teams and heroes. I would be very surprised if they said it wasn’t doable.”</p>
<p>“Perfect,” I said. That helped if and when it came to negotiating. I held up my hand. “Funding, costumes, target… target is hard to pin down. A lot of low-level threats out there, banding together.”</p>
<p>“If you’re keeping an eye out for the criminal populations that aren’t joining larger groups, the places you want to keep an eye on are the Cabin, the Tea-Shop, the Pitstop, the Rail, and the Greens. Those last three places are pretty seedy and traditional villain bars. The others are villain bars without the bar part.”</p>
<p>“What about the ones who are hooked into bigger groups?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That gets more complicated, and it’s less about the places to watch and more about the names to keep an ear out for,” my dad said. “Marquis, Goddess, Lord of Loss, Mama Mathers, the Crowley brothers, Deader and Goner, Barrow.”</p>
<p>I knew the names and I knew where they were situated. No big surprises there. I nodded to myself. <em>Marquis.</em> So casually mentioned.</p>
<p>“How messy is it?” my dad asked, his voice softer.</p>
<p>“They’re young, some of them are kids, and I’m not positive they’re all going to survive the next two weeks,” I said. “And that’s not even&mdash; there’s enough other <em>mess</em> I could almost forget about that danger hanging over their heads.”</p>
<p>“You’ve taken them under your wing?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I’m going to at least point them in the right direction, I hope. I might be the wrong person for the job, but someone has to do it, right?”</p>
<p>“Wow,” my dad said, barely audible.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “It’s hard to articulate.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to play this slow, keep it calm. I know a lot and I’ve been down some of these roads. I’m hopeful I can at least keep things from getting out of control.”</p>
<p>“That may be a tall order,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I said. “If they absolutely insist on getting out there and mixing things up, I’ll point them in the direction of the asshole villains who are ramping up their activity and taking things over. The nascent Tattletales and Marquises. Kneecap them or their plans before they can get too big.”</p>
<p>“You really are your mother’s daughter,” my dad said.</p>
<p>My eyebrows went about as high up as they could as I turned my full attention toward him.</p>
<p>“What you said before, and what you said just now. Those words could have come from her mouth in a different time and place.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t winning points with me,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to win points,” he said. “I want to make sure you’re safe, sane, and healthy.”</p>
<p>I noticed the implication of what he was saying. That taking this course might not be one of those three things.</p>
<p>“What should I be doing different?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said. “I don’t think any of it is wrong, but I haven’t always been the best judge in the moment. I’d say CYA.”</p>
<p>“On what front?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Do you have counsel on call?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t aware we even had a legal system yet.”</p>
<p>“We don’t, but it’s coming soon.”</p>
<p>Counsel on call. It was common for new teams of heroes to have a lawyer available, who they could call and outline the situation to before they took action. Covering their asses, making sure the arrests could stick, that there was a voice with the authority and knowledge to talk to the police and courts if and when the heroes’ actions were questioned in more depth.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a bad idea. It hobbled things, slowed them down, it was a bit of a headache… but having a lawyer as a hoop to jump through could restrain some of the more impulsive parts of the team. I’d have to run it by them, but it made sense.</p>
<p>“I could ask around,” my dad offered. “But if you really wanted a good perspective on who you could talk to, there are better people to ask.”</p>
<p>“You mean mom,” I said.</p>
<p>My dad nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I clenched my fist and relaxed it. “I’ll talk to her.”</p>
<p>“You really want this.”</p>
<p>I thought of the team when it had been operating together, playing off one another, being good at what they did. I thought of Tattletale and her version of my hometown and how much I really wanted her and people like her to lose every reason they had to be smug and confident.</p>
<p>I wanted to bring those two ideas together into a concrete reality, and I wanted it badly enough I was willing to go have a conversation with my mom when I was really fucking pissed at her.</p>
<p>If it meant wrangling this team that was going to do what they were doing whether I was involved or not, I’d do that.</p>
<p>“I feel like whatever I say, you’re going to say I’m just like mom again, and then I’m going to be mad at you,” I said.</p>
<p>“Can’t have that,” my dad said.</p>
<p>“Putting all of that stuff aside,” I said. “If I walked away, if I left it alone, I’m scared of what would happen to people who didn’t deserve it. I can’t do that. I don’t know if that’s the Carol in me talking, but it’s the truth.”</p>
<p>My dad nodded to himself. “That’s not your mom talking, I’m pretty sure. Similar, but… not your mom.”</p>
<p>He didn’t even need to say it. The moment I’d seen the look on his face as he’d opened his mouth, I’d realized who I’d been echoing.</p>

<p>⊙</p>
<p>I’d had to take the train to get to the Wardens’ HQ. It was a fortress of a building, indomitable, and it was situated near the largest cluster of portals in Gimel, very possibly the largest cluster of portals in all the known worlds.</p>
<p>I looked up at a knight in plate armor with his bowed head, both hands on the pommel of a sword, with the tip resting on the ground. A cloth wrap partially covered the legs, like a flag worn around the waist, long enough to reach the knees in front, and to drape near the ankles at the back. Two shields stood behind the figure, hanging in the air at a height and position reminiscent of folded wings.</p>
<p>It was typically simplified when shrunk down for website images and badges, the position of arms, hands and shields suggesting the lines of a ‘W’ for the first letter of ‘Wardens’. Here, it was four stories of statue, built into the front face of the building.</p>
<p>It put me in mind of Gilpatrick’s speech. Five pounds of gun, fifteen pounds of armor? No. Here, at this scale, it was fifty tons of sword, a hundred and fifty tons of armor and shield. Every inch and pound of its composition was symbolism.</p>
<p>“It’s something, isn’t it?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s something.”</p>
<p>I turned to look at him. He’d just walked up to stand beside me. He’d tidied his hair some. I had the impression he’d started to dress up for the occasion and his other impulses stylewise had taken over. His shirt was a button-up, red silk, with buttons in twos at the regular intervals. He wore it very casually, with the sleeves rolled up and the buttons undone at the collarbone. He’d paired it with a nice pair of black jeans, and he’d painted his hair a red that more closely matched his shirt.</p>
<p>“Reminds me of that video that circulated online for a bit. Chevalier and the last fight against Behemoth,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” I said. “Probably intentional. It’s a good mental image to have, the hard fight and the great improvements that follow.”</p>
<p>“And the disaster that followed <em>that</em>?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>I frowned at him.</p>
<p>“It’s reality,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s a little pessimistic,” I said. I glanced back. I spotted Sveta making her way up the steps from the sidewalk to the raised bit of ground in front of the building. “Hey!”</p>
<p>She wore a black dress that gathered together as a halter neck, with tights covering the legs. She’d redone some of the paint on her arms and shoulders, the paint around the ball joint and along the shell that encased each arm fresh and glossy.</p>
<p>“You guys dressed up a bit,” I said.</p>
<p>“We exchanged some texts,” Tristan said. “I think we psyched each other up some.”</p>
<p>“I was redoing my paint after all the running around and tree climbing yesterday,” Sveta said. “I started overthinking things.”</p>
<p>“You look good,” I said.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You too.” I was wearing a very similar outfit to when I’d been job hunting.</p>
<p>Kenzie was last to catch up to us, running up the stairs. Knee-high socks, a skirt with overlapping stripes, and a blue sweater in a light material, worn over a shirt with the collar poking up through the neckhole. The pin in her hair looked like a bow, but it was two-dimensional and metal.</p>
<p>“Did you go home to change?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You actually wore that to school?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It looks nice, thank you very much,” she said.</p>
<p>“I agree,” I said. “I might have worn something similar when I was around Kenzie’s age.”</p>
<p>“I can understand <em>you</em> not getting bullied,” Tristan told me. “Your parents are superheroes.”</p>
<p>“I don’t get bullied either,” Kenzie said. “I wouldn’t mind if I did. It would at least mean my classmates would pay attention to me.”</p>
<p>“They don’t?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Feels like everyone’s busy with their own thing,” Kenzie said. She looked up at the statue that stood in relief from the front of the Wardens’ headquarters. “Still hurting from recent losses.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see what we can do to keep future losses from happening,” I said.</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Inside the building, statues of key members stood off to either side of the lobby. Chevalier, Narwhal, Valkyrie, Legend, Cinereal, Stonewall, Topflight and Miss Militia. The building was set up so the people on the second, third, and fourth floors could stand at the glass railings and look down at the lobby, and vice versa. People in business clothes were walking every which way, upstairs, and people on the ground floor were free to peruse the gift shop or wait for tours.</p>
<p>There were larger display boards set up around the edges of the lobby, much like the maps that were stationed around malls, but these showed off the icons for each of the teams under the Wardens’ umbrella. They might have been touchscreens. There were screens for Advance Guard, Foresight, the Attendant, the Shepherds, and smaller teams like the Kings of the Hill, the Wayfinders, and the Navigators. The screen for the Attendant was still up, but it was dark, only the faint outline of the Attendants’ icon on the screen. The Shepherd’s screen had been moved forward and to a position of more prominence.</p>
<p>It was darker than the PRT offices had been. The aesthetic of the PRT of yesteryear had always been predominantly white, with black stenciled letters and icons, the periodic bit of chrome or mirror when tech was required. Here, it was dark stone, lined in gold or brass, and the lighting made me think of a cinema with lights set on high ceilings and tuned to be unobtrusive. It was transparent and open in layout and the suggestion of there being very few barriers, like with the glass railings, or the way that it really looked like anyone on the ground floor could go anywhere without checkpoints or security.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“I should check on my mom first, see if she’s free for a short conversation.”</p>
<p>“Where is she?”</p>
<p>“Legal or Liaison. I’ve been here twice before, but the first time they were still getting everything put together, and I don’t remember much from the second.”</p>
<p>Sveta turned around slowly, then pointed.</p>
<p>“Good,” I said. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Are you on good terms with your parents these days?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“I’m…” I started. “No.”</p>
<p>“Is she going to help?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “It’s not that kind of bad terms, where she’d say no, I don’t think.”</p>
<p>“Is it the kind of bad terms where you invite someone to come with you so you don’t have to worry about the ‘rents being super embarrassing and lame?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“If I had any idea on what she might say or do then this would be easier,” I said. “I think it’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>The stairs led from either side of the front desk to the second floor, going around the statue-in-relief that mirrored the one on the front of the building. The security checkpoint was on the second floor, more or less hidden behind the statue and the slab it stood out from. Glass walls separated the walkway from the offices and departments around the building exterior.</p>
<p>“Names?” the man at the desk asked.</p>
<p>“Victoria Dallon, Sveta Karelia, Kenzie Martin, Tristan Vera,” I said.</p>
<p>“Intentions?”</p>
<p>“We have an appointment with Foresight on the fifth floor. I was also hoping to stop in and see my mom at her workplace. I’m not sure if she’s at Legal or Liaison right now.”</p>
<p>“Her name?”</p>
<p>“Carol Dallon.”</p>
<p>“One second.”</p>
<p>The person made a phone call. I waited, a little nervous, emotions stirred up. Anger, frustration, disappointment, worry.</p>
<p>Kenzie had her chin at the top of the railing, as she looked down at the lobby. Sveta stood next to her, with Tristan off to one side.</p>
<p>“Is Weld getting a statue?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Not for a while,” Sveta said. “That’s more for people who’ve put in the years, and he only just got in. He’s got a preliminary thing in the gift shop.”</p>
<p>“No shit? Awesome. We should stop in at the gift shop before we leave.”</p>
<p>“You’re such a kid,” Kenzie said, sticking out her tongue at Tristan. He reached out to muss up her hair and she ducked back out of the way.</p>
<p>“Victoria, was it?” the person at the desk asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“Your mother says you can go up. She’s at Legal on the third floor. She’ll take her break when you arrive, so you’ll have about fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to wince. Fifteen minutes was too much. Still, saying that would cause problems. “Great.”</p>
<p>“Give me five seconds, and I’ll give you your guest ID cards. Can your friends come to the desk?”</p>
<p>We lined up in front of the desk. The printer didn’t take long, spitting out four cards in four seconds.</p>
<p>“Check your names are accurate, please, and&mdash; there seems to be a problem with miss… Kenzie?”</p>
<p>He turned the card around. A slash of distortion masked Kenzie’s face, tracing from her cheekbone to one corner of her forehead. It looked like the heavy compression artifacting that came with any image that had been compressed too many times, but it was dense to the point that her eyes, nose, and cheekbone were almost completely covered.</p>
<p>“Do you want to try again?” Kenzie asked. She had her phone in her hand as she clasped her hands behind her back. I saw the screen momentarily light up.</p>
<p>The man tapped at the keyboard for a few seconds, then turned around to grab the card as the machine spat it out. He gave a singular nod and passed the card with its attached lanyard to Kenzie. Picture normal.</p>
<p>We headed for the stairs up to the third floor.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know they were going to take our photos,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“What are you even doing, obscuring your face like that?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not on purpose, obviously, it’s a byproduct of tech I’m wearing.”</p>
<p>Once we reached the third floor, there was less in the way of civilian-facing offices, and there were more people in suits and business clothes. The glass wall had letters applied to it. Just ‘303 &mdash; LEGAL’.</p>
<p>My mom had had a study back at our house, with the hundred or so legal tomes with all of the case history, precedent, and whatever else, on top of the books we’d fashioned ourselves, binding in a variety of ways, saving team stuff, parahuman case files we’d printed off the net, and more.</p>
<p>This was that, it was the same kind of heavy oak desks that my mom had had in her study, the shelves, the desk lamps and the scattered paperwork that had yet to be gathered together and bound. It was files and filing cabinets, a storm of legality as if a giant had sneezed in a legal office.</p>
<p>My mom might have been one of the older people around. A lot of the lawyers looked young, and at two in the afternoon, jackets were off and slung on the backs of chairs, sleeves were rolled up and perfect hairstyles were just a little bit messed up. She was doing a lot of the talking, taking charge and getting people organized.</p>
<p>A young lady approached us at the doorway. “If you’re wanting to lay charges against the Wardens, or if you have witness testimony to give, you’ll want to go to Casework on the second floor. I know it’s confusing.”</p>
<p>“My mom is Carol Dallon, I’m just stopping in to ask a question. The people at check-in said it was okay.”</p>
<p>“Oh wow, yeah, look at you. I definitely see the resemblance. Your mom is awesome, you know.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said, my eyebrows going up momentarily.</p>
<p>The lady stepped away to fetch my mom.</p>
<p>The feeling of trepidation got worse as I watched my mom walk toward me. It was hard to divorce this scene and image with my memory of being on the street outside my mom’s house, the hurt and the feelings there.</p>
<p>My mom smiled, acknowledging the other three. “Victoria. This is a pleasant surprise.”</p>
<p>“I had a conversation with dad last night. He suggested that you might be the person to ask for this thing these guys are doing.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” my mom said. She barely seemed fazed by that. “Just business?”</p>
<p>“More or less,” I said.</p>
<p>Man, I was still so pissed at her. I was more pissed somehow that she was being nice and casual.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to help however you need it,” she said. “The only issue is I can’t step away right this minute. We’re waiting on a phone call from some people in the would-be government, and my coworker is away on a late lunch.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to step away,” I said. “These guys are starting up a team. Dad suggested they’d do best if they had someone legal to call up before any big moves. Make sure charges stick.”</p>
<p>My mom looked over at the three. Kenzie put her hand up in a small wave.</p>
<p>“Is that <em>Sveta</em>?”</p>
<p>“Hi, Mrs. Dallon.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t recognize you at first. I can’t believe it,” my mom said. She approached Sveta, taking Sveta’s hands and lifting them up. “What beautiful work.”</p>
<p>“I’m pleased with it,” Sveta said, ducking her head a bit.</p>
<p>“And the art&mdash; is this yours? It reminds me of what I saw you working on during one of my visits.”</p>
<p>“It’s mine.”</p>
<p>“It’s stellar,” my mom said.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose you’d know someone you could put us in touch with?” I asked, more tense than I’d wanted to sound.</p>
<p>“I can ask around. Are you paying them?”</p>
<p>“I think we’d have to,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re pretty overloaded right now. I can’t make promises.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the team has any major moves planned for early in their career,” I said. “Having someone available a month from now or two months from now might be good.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re still moving at this clip two months from now.”</p>
<p>“What do you do?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“We’re lobbying on behalf of the Wardens. The government is figuring out the law as we speak, and we’re trying to figure out the most effective approach to handle law and parahumans and how they interact in the new world. A lot of precedent, citing past history, pulling from the law of Earth Bet.”</p>
<p>“It sounds heavy,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We’re deciding the legal fabric of the new world. It is,” my mom said.</p>
<p>“Can you sound some people out?” I asked. “Having someone we could trust to be discreet would be ideal. It wouldn’t be heavy.”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask around. I know we’ve got a few ex-law students who are in limbo,” my mom said. She gave me a look. “They could use the extra funds, and they should have enough knowledge of the system as it stands. They’re even on the ground floor for the legal system we may end up with, if we’re successful here.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. “We’ll discuss and I’ll look at the books, and we’ll see if we can pay them something fair.”</p>
<p><em>Keep it business.</em></p>
<p>“Would you come to dinner tonight?” she asked. “We can talk. If I have a better idea of what you’re doing, I can find you a better fit.”</p>
<p>“I’d really rather not,” I said.</p>
<p>“Communication is key. We should talk.”</p>
<p>“Another time,” I said. <em>Weeks or months from now.</em></p>
<p>“Okay,” she said. “I’d like to invite your sister to a sit-down.”</p>
<p>My dignity and grace were dashed away, just like that. A startling, painful jar from reality to somewhere else. The lights of the brightly lit legal office seemed too bright and the dark shadows and the dimly lit building interior of the Wardens HQ and its lobby seemed too dark.</p>
<p>It was very, very hard, in the moment, to separate my recollection of being outside the house with her inside that house, from this, and to convince myself that she wasn’t here, somewhere nearby.</p>
<p>“Nah,” I said. My voice too soft.</p>
<p>“Victoria&mdash;”</p>
<p>“<em>Mom,</em>” I said, my voice sharp. “Do you want this conversation to go in the same direction as the one at the barbecue?”</p>
<p>“That’s up to you,” she said.</p>
<p>I thought about saying something regrettable.</p>
<p>“Bye mom. Good luck with your thing.”</p>
<p>She looked like she might say something, but she smiled instead, and said, “Good luck with yours.”</p>
<p>I turned to go, and the others followed.</p>
<p>We walked a little way around the circumference of the floor, between the offices to our right and the railing to our left, until we were a distance away from the legal department. I leaned on the railing, and wrapped one of my hands around the other, squeezing it.</p>
<p>Sveta put an arm around me, and then Kenzie walked up to the other side of me and put a hand on my back.</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” I said.</p>
<p>There wasn’t an immediate response.</p>
<p>“She was never my favorite person,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“You seemed to get along with her before.”</p>
<p>Sveta shook her head, hair flying out a little ways. “You were always really down when she was due to visit, and you were down when she missed visits. And you were down after she came.”</p>
<p>“I was down all the time.”</p>
<p>“It was different kinds.”</p>
<p>“Family’s hard,” Tristan said. “It really sucks sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Kenzie said. “Family can be the best and it can be the worst.”</p>
<p>Sveta let her arm slide off my shoulder. It settled on Kenzie’s head with a faint clack.</p>
<p>“Ow,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Sveta’s fingers lifted up, then came down, in a pat.</p>
<p>I stood straighter, and Sveta moved a bit away, her arm reeling in, giving me freedom to stand back. “Hopefully this gets you guys one step closer to being a team with everything you need. We should go talk to Foresight and see if we can get you the rest of the way.”</p>
<p>“What’re we talking about with Foresight?”</p>
<p>“Jurisdiction,” I said. “There might be a few other pieces of ground to cover, finances, selling info.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” he said. “You up to talking about the kind of info you can gather, Kenz?”</p>
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<p>The fifth floor wasn’t built around a hole in the floor like the bottom four were. There wasn’t a view of the lobby, a railing, or anything of the sort. Another security checkpoint was set up at the base of the stairs. With our lanyards and guest IDs, we were clear to go. Our arrival was preceded by a shift in lights visible from the stairwell.</p>
<p><em>Masks on</em>.</p>
<p>The floor plan was closer to a proper office building, with hallways studded with posters and pictures of team members and leaders, teams, and framed news articles. The hallway to the right of us had ‘SHEPHERDS’ and a shepherd’s crook running down the length of it, a burgundy stripe of paint lit up by lights on the underside of the crook. Red-brown colors to the wall, and the articles and pictures were all for the Shepherds.</p>
<p>In the hallway to our left, Foresight, blue and black paint and lights, Foresight members and victories on the wall opposite.</p>
<p>A door opened and a few Shepherds stepped out into the hall.</p>
<p>“Holy shit,” one said.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Tristan said, under his breath.</p>
<p>It was the moon girl, from my job interview with Attendant. She was the one who had urged me away from the Fallen. I was hardly enthused to see her either.</p>
<p>“Tristan,” she said. “Tell me you’re not interviewing for a team.”</p>
<p>“I’m not,” he said. “I’ve got the team already.”</p>
<p>She pursed her lips together.</p>
<p>“History, Moonsong?” someone asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Moonsong said. “Tribute knows.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the guy who was apparently ‘Tribute’ said. He wore what looked like a hypermodernized version of the suit of armor with the cape over one shoulder. It wasn’t old fashioned armor, though. It was panels on a bodysuit, and the cape was cut to cling close to his body, angular for flowing cloth, with glowing lines where the sharp angles were. “History is putting it lightly.”</p>
<p>“We’re late for an appointment,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You’re the guys who are talking to Foresight,” someone else said. “They mentioned something like that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. Then, aware of the opening in the conversation, I elaborated with, “Hello again, Moonsong.”</p>
<p>“Hello,” she said. “What was your name again?”</p>
<p>“Victoria.”</p>
<p>“You seemed cool, Victoria. What are you doing with this bastard?”</p>
<p>“Wow,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Just helping out,” I said.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t need it, and he doesn’t deserve it.”</p>
<p>“Whatever’s in the past, he gets his second chance, like anyone. He wants to help people, and I’m going to help him do that.”</p>
<p>“He’s one of the monsters you help save people <em>from</em>,” Moonsong said. “You get that, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>She stopped as Tristan put one hand out in front of her, keeping her from jumping forward in his defense.</p>
<p>“Tribute and I arrested him,” Moonsong said. “You know that, right?”</p>
<p>I could see the lines in Tristan’s jaw standing out. He said, “I know. I remember.”</p>
<p>“I want to see Byron,” Moonsong said.</p>
<p>“Not your call. His turn isn’t until later.”</p>
<p>There was a shudder, and then my hair started to move.  The light further down the hallway seemed to grow darker, and my stomach lurched in a sensation that I connected to a lot of aerial acrobatics.</p>
<p>“You want to pick a fight <em>here?</em>” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Tribute shifted his footing, stepping forward a little, and clasped his hands in front of his groin. With his head bowed slightly, he was faintly reminiscent of the Wardens’ emblem.</p>
<p>I stepped forward, ready to put myself between them, and I felt the stomach-lurching sensation again. My leg buckled, and I nearly fell.</p>
<p>My hair was floating now, and my legs were straining, almost locked in position with the stress of keeping me upright.</p>
<p>Gravity manipulation, but somehow a mix of zero-grav and enhanced gravity.</p>
<p>I flew instead of walking, and it was hard to keep my position. I stopped when I was between Tristan and the other two. “This isn’t helpful.”</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Moonsong said. “I’m going to tell you how this goes.”</p>
<p>I felt the gravity shift again, an attempt to put me down against the floor, and threw up my forcefield to avoid twisting my ankle or hitting the ground too hard. I was glad my skirt wasn’t the kind that could flip up, as it hugged my thighs, but my midriff was exposed now.</p>
<p>“Tristan joins the team, and he charms the pants off of everyone he meets. He’s good at the stuff he does in front of the camera, he’s good at the hero stuff, he’s <em>strong</em>. He gets decent grades, he makes friends, he finds allies and he works on them. Because that’s what sociopaths do. He doesn’t actually care about them.”</p>
<p>“Sociopath?” Tristan asked. “You’re as deluded as ever.”</p>
<p>“He jokes and acts all cute about how he’s competitive, he likes to win, and he tends to win so you don’t really see how sore of a loser he is when things go bad. He sets his sights on something he wants, he gets it. Sets his sights on something else, he gets it. Until he doesn’t get what he wants. Like being team leader or getting a key role in an event that’s coming up. That’s when he starts <em>using</em> the people he’s been working on. They’re usually desperate people. Vulnerable ones.”</p>
<p>I thought of Rain, who Tristan had called a friend. Or did the whole team count?</p>
<p>“It’s called leaning on people when you’re struggling.”</p>
<p>“It’s called manipulation. And you’re good at it,” Tribute said.</p>
<p>“Fuck off,” Tristan said. “Drop the power use and let us go. We’ve got things to do.”</p>
<p>“Moonsong,” Sveta said. “I don’t think you know Tristan as well as you think.”</p>
<p>“Same,” Moonsong said. “I feel really sorry for you if he’s already got into your good graces. Because that bastard is the kind of guy who hires someone who kills people by looking at them to cover his ass, and uses them against teammates. He likes to win and he wins at any cost.”</p>
<p>“We know the story,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I doubt you know the entirety of it. Have you split the discussion fifty-fifty between listening to him and Byron?” Moonsong asked. She didn’t even wait for a response before deciding, “No. Because it doesn’t work that way.”</p>
<p>“I gave Byron the opportunity,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Moonsong said. “I know how that goes. Like with Team Reach’s therapist, right? You get your turn, Byron gets his, you go in for extra advice, you take over, and somehow the team’s therapist gets weird ideas in his head about Byron. You suggest things and then when Byron gets his turn he’s having to play defense, get rid of these preconceived ideas. He gets no time of his own with the therapist, because he’s stuck trying to undo the damage Tristan did during his time.”</p>
<p>“All I did,” Tristan said, lines standing out as his neck, “Was try to figure shit out. There’s a lot to figure out with the situation being what it is, and somehow I end up doing the legwork.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of work to manipulate everyone around you, isn’t it?” Moonsong asked.</p>
<p>“Stop,” I said. “Stop this. <em>Now</em>.”</p>
<p>I pushed out with a faint hit of aura.</p>
<p>“Please,” Sveta said, adding her voice to mine.</p>
<p>“I want to hear that Byron is okay, from Byron’s mouth. I don’t give a shit about Tristan’s time.”</p>
<p>“Fuck this,” Tristan said. “Fine.”</p>
<p>He blurred, his eyes becoming crimson points, then transitioning to become teal.</p>
<p>Byron, wearing a sweatshirt and jeans.</p>
<p>The gravity effect dropped away.</p>
<p>“Hi Byron,” Kenzie said, her voice small.</p>
<p>“Hi Kenzie.”</p>
<p>“You okay?” Moonsong asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve had better weeks, but things with my brother are as tolerable as they get,” Byron said. He slouched, sticking his hands in the pocket of the sweatshirt. “You kind of went overboard.”</p>
<p>“I had to check.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Byron said.</p>
<p>There was a noise behind us, and I turned to look.</p>
<p>Foresight. Anelace and someone I hadn’t met.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you come on in? Step into the office,” Anelace asked. “Moonsong? Can I have a word?”</p>
<p>Foresight’s administrative office wasn’t the same office I’d been in when I’d interviewed with them. Their headquarters was situated elsewhere, and this was something else, a space set up for meetings, for paperwork, interactions with other teams and more. Much like the hallways had, it looked like an office.</p>
<p>Right away, Moonsong, Tribute, and the member of Foresight stepped into an office, closing the doors. The blinds were at an angle where I could see where they stood, but not their expressions or what they might be saying.</p>
<p>Anelace stepped into the back, then came back to the sitting area. He looked at us, then at the other members of Moonsong’s group. “Come on. Let’s keep everyone separate until things are settled.”</p>
<p>Our group walked into a back room, a single table and some nice chairs in a room with a coffee maker and microwave.</p>
<p>“I was looking forward to seeing you again, Victoria,” Anelace said. “Sorry it’s not under better circumstances.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go talk to the others. There won’t be a problem if I leave you guys here?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I said.</p>
<p>Anelace left us in the room. Kenzie flopped forward, forehead hitting the table, arms extended all the way in front of her.</p>
<p>Byron changed back to Tristan.</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said, quiet. “So long as I’m here, Moonsong is going to be frothing at the mouth. I’m trading out until she’s good and gone.”</p>
<p>They swapped back. Byron slouched into his seat.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that about the therapy, Byron,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Byron shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s why you don’t want to sit in for Mrs. Yamada’s?”</p>
<p>“It’s part of it,” he said. “Look, I don’t want to demonize Tristan or anything, like Moon is so good at doing. He has his good side, but a lot of the time, I’ve got to conserve my strength for dealing with the rougher patches. Minor, basic stuff.”</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s a sociopath?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Byron said. “But I think… he’s got to be the worst possible person to end up sharing a body with.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything I or we can do to make it easier?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m working on a camera that looks inside Tristan to find Byron, or vice-versa,” Kenzie said, without raising her head. “It’s not going so well but I’m going to figure it out.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Kenz. No, nothing makes it easier. You can… tackle the broad strokes, you can be careful not to talk past my face to say something to Tristan and never do the opposite when Tristan’s the one in front. It doesn’t make a difference with the stuff that really matters. That’s my stuff to deal with.”</p>
<p>“What stuff?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He’s… stubborn, destructively stubborn, he holds this idea of what should happen in his head, and if that doesn’t work for you then you’re probably going to be pretty unhappy, because you aren’t going to change anything about it.”</p>
<p>“Reminds me a bit of my mom when you describe it that way,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you can walk away from your mom, can’t you?” Byron asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I sighed.</p>
<p>“I really appreciate that sigh. Maybe you get it,” he said, leaning his head back until it rested against the wall, his face turned skyward. “He thrives on competition, you know. He’ll be a terrific hero, probably. Put a challenge in front of him, and he’ll give his all to kick its ass.”</p>
<p>“But?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s him. That’s who he is, intrinsically. I don’t know if there’s a but. It’s reality, and it’s reality that I’m the challenge and he’s energized when it comes to the tug of war over this one body we share. He thrives on it in a way, and I’m… drained, beaten down.”</p>
<p>“We have your back,” Sveta said. “Not just Tristan’s. We’re backing Capricorn, and we’re invested in finding answers for both of you.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that. But I don’t like this. At best, it’s… more draining. More of me being beaten down and left more exhausted. At worst… Moonsong <em>might</em> be right.”</p>
<p>“At best,” I said, “It’s Tristan doing what he’s good at doing. What happens if he doesn’t have that outlet?”</p>
<p>I didn’t get a response.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door. Anelace, the dagger-themed member of Foresight.</p>
<p>“Can you join us?” he asked.</p>
<p>We migrated from the team’s lunch room to the office where the team leader, Moonsong and Tribute were seated.</p>
<p>The leader stood by his desk, one foot on his chair. He looked larger of frame, and had Foresight’s symbol on an eye patch. A bit of a corsair look, with a jacket and lots of belts, and long black hair tied back into a sailor’s ponytail. Veins of gold decorated his costume.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the hassle,” Tribute said. “History. Things never really resolved so much as we all walked away with the situation left halfway through a disaster.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been having a conversation with the Shepherds,” the leader of Foresight said. “They’ve explained some of the history. It muddies the waters.”</p>
<p>“We understand,” Sveta said. “Sorry about this.”</p>
<p>“They had the suggestion that we make sure <em>both</em> of the Capricorn twins are on board with this plan of yours.”</p>
<p>“Why’d you have to drag me into this, Moonsong? This doesn’t help. I don’t want to own any part of this, whatever they do.”</p>
<p>“I will always fight to give you your voice.”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>want</em> to speak,” Byron said. “I want to ignore this side of my reality and conserve my strength for the fights that need it.”</p>
<p>“Is that a no, then?” the leader of Foresight asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Byron said. He seemed to flounder for a moment. He looked at me. “Fuck.”</p>
<p>He didn’t break that eye contact with me as he said it. My eyebrow went up.</p>
<p>“Don’t let me get in the way of you giving these guys their chance,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“You’re vouching for them?” the Foresight leader asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Byron punctuated the sentence by changing into Tristan.</p>
<p>“I’m good with this,” Tristan said, shifting his posture to avoid looking at Moonsong.</p>
<p>“Good,” the Foresight leader said. “Thank you for your time, Shepherds.”</p>
<p>Tribute and Moonsong left the office. Just Anlace, the leader, Kenzie, Byron, Sveta and I, now.</p>
<p>I looked around the office and saw an article. The leader was on the cover, with the name ‘Brio’.</p>
<p>“You really want to do this?” Brio asked.</p>
<p>“They’re suited for it,” I said. “They have the ability to gather the information and figure out how to crack the toughest nuts. Tinker devices and people on the ground who won’t get a second look hanging around Hollow Point. They get the info, they sell it to you guys, and if you want it, they work with you on the actual cracking of the nut. Joint operation, or it can be solo, one way or the other.”</p>
<p>“Are you participating?” he asked.</p>
<p>“If I’m wanted, I’ll add my strength to theirs for the big plays.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, there’s a lot about this that could work,” Brio said. “When the Wardens gathered us all together, they assigned territories by lottery. We’ve got other things we’re focusing on, and Hollow Point is in a bad way.”</p>
<p>“If you’ll pay a modest fee, enough to cover their lawyer, buy the info, keep them supplied, they’ll bring you in for the actual arrests. It’s a win for you guys, while these guys do the leg work.”</p>
<p>“If it works,” Brio said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re hard workers,” Kenzie said. “We’re really good at what we do.”</p>
<p>“I don’t doubt that,” Brio said. His voice had a tone shift that suggested he was used to talking to kids in a certain context. “You have a lot of hurdles.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been doing our initial research,” Anelace said. “Figuring out how we might fix Hollow Point. They’re tied into some bigger-picture stuff.”</p>
<p>“Tattletale,” I said.</p>
<p>“Her on one end,” Anelace said. “But she’s more the kind of person you have to deal with further down the road. Once you scare them, they’ll call her. They already called her once about us, and she reached out to try to convince us to leave the area alone.”</p>
<p>“And?” I asked.</p>
<p>“And we’re leaving it alone, or we were, until you sent your proposal,” Brio said.</p>
<p>I nodded. Not good to hear, but understandable. I wondered what played into that decision.</p>
<p>“On the front end, you’ve got some others to deal with. You’ll have to get past them before you can even start on the project.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Speedrunners,” Anelace said. He turned around, reached for a file, and put it on the desk, pushing it in our direction.</p>
<p>“I know them,” I said. I left the file for Sveta, Tristan and Kenzie to look at.</p>
<p>“A couple of times a day, they use their time powers. Sweep the area, search every nook and cranny. You won’t be able to set up shop.”</p>
<p>“That’d be Secondhand,” I said.</p>
<p>“They use Final Hour to cover other business. Even if you avoid being caught in the sweeps, you won’t be able to look or listen in if they’re conducting meetings in banked timestreams.”</p>
<p>“And Last Minute is still with the group?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>Fucking time manipulators.</em> “Something to work out in advance then.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got two thinkers, Braindead and Birdbrain, working as a team. You won’t be able to have undercover agents if they’re checking things. You will be tracked and your agents will be thoroughly investigated.”</p>
<p>More folders hit the table.</p>
<p>“Powers complicate things, and they’ve got a lot of powers there,” Anelace said.</p>
<p>“Bitter Pill, tinker,” Brio said. “A <em>lot</em> of the people in Hollow Point are expected to partake, and that means truth serums, just to start with.”</p>
<p>I looked at the other members of the group.</p>
<p>“You really think you’re up for this?” Brio asked.</p>
<p>“Just speaking for myself, I’m more excited to do this than I was before you started talking about what we’re up against,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I already have some ideas,” Kenzie said. “Not about the time guys, but I have ideas.”</p>
<p>“We knock the time guys down first,” Tristan said. “Without a question. We’ll have to. We can do this.”</p>
<p>I looked at Sveta, who had been quiet.</p>
<p>“I want to do this,” she said, meeting Brio’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll give you our files as starting points. You guys own this if it ends up being a disaster, you keep us informed, and&mdash;”</p>
<p>“In exchange,” I interrupted, “You guys give us access to your costume sourcing.”</p>
<p>“I can do costumes,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Without battery lives?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Give us access to your costume manufacturing. I know you have it and I know you’re branching out to share it.”</p>
<p>Anelace and Brio exchanged a look. Brio nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“And you give us your blessing to operate in this territory,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I like what I saw earlier,” Brio said. “Blessing might be a strong word.”</p>
<p>“All parahumans have their issues,” I said.</p>
<p>Brio seemed to consider for a moment.</p>
<p>He extended his hand to shake.</p>
<p>We shook it, each of us in turn.</p>
<p>No name yet, costumes to be decided, codenames to be determined.</p>
<p>But we were a team with a mission. We were doing this.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap33">Glare &mdash; Interlude 3</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Dot moved slowly and carefully through the store. She placed a hand on the floor for the added balance and weight distribution, then slid the hand left to right and back again, pushing it through a layer of dust that gathered and tumbled onto the back of her hand.</p>
<p>She was glad for the fingerless glove she wore, because it let her feel the finer details while keeping it clean and warm. The floor was cool and moist. The exterior wall of the store was letting the rain in, and the rain traced a path through one portion of the store, cutting thin rivers through the dust. Wet in places, dry in places, but persistently clammy and dirty. Perpetually colorless.</p>
<p>It was the lack of color that got to her the most.</p>
<p>It was one of the big stores, where everything was gathered together into tall stacks and piles beneath and on metal racks. The lights were fluorescent, and they flickered. The buzzing sounds the lights made were more constant than the light.</p>
<p>A menacing sound. Menacing, glaring lights.</p>
<p>It was safer to climb on the stacks of cardboard boxes than it was to walk on the floor or to make contact with the wood and metal of the shelves.</p>
<p>She paused as she climbed to a higher shelf, figuring out how best to ascend while minimizing dangerous contact. Finally, she decided to take a risk by grabbing a metal cross-bar, hauling herself up, and setting her feet on a series of plastic bottles in cardboard trays, stacked higher than a man was tall.</p>
<p>She couldn’t read well, but she could recognize the labels. Pills. Vitamins, probably. If these were here, then there might be better offerings close by. She searched the nearby piles until she found cardboard boxes with cartoon characters on the front. Pictures of cartoon character heads were beside not-cartoon images in shiny monocolor shapes.</p>
<p>Dot opened a box, careful not to make noise, and fished inside. A plastic bottle within, and inside the plastic bottle… a colorful assortment of gummy vitamins.</p>
<p>She fished out the contents and pushed them into her mouth until she could barely close her jaw. The artificial taste overpowered her nose and mouth. Her eyes rolled back into her head with the effort of chewing.</p>
<p>A loud noise made her freeze.</p>
<p>The doors had been opened. She heard loud footsteps.</p>
<p>She climbed deeper into the stacks of vitamins, listening and watching.</p>
<p>“Hellooooo!” the call was drawn out. Dot tensed, listening as the greeting bounced around the building interior.</p>
<p>Dot waited.</p>
<p>“Anyone here!?”</p>
<p>She waited, silent, peering through the gaps between the cardboard boxes and plastic bottles.</p>
<p>Another voice could be heard saying, “Lights are on and nobody’s home?”</p>
<p>“They could be out, or a group of refugees might have stopped in on their way to the portal. They could have set up power and scavenged before leaving things behind for others.”</p>
<p>Dot winced with every tromp of boot on tiled floor. She could hear people rummaging, pulling down boxes and tearing into the contents. Things fell to the ground.</p>
<p>She changed locations, putting some distance between herself and them. It didn’t help; their explorations meant they drew nearer to her as she lurked on a high shelf.</p>
<p>“…names you can’t pronounce, grab that first.”</p>
<p>“Why? Preservatives?”</p>
<p>“Preservatives, yep. Keep a close eye out for the products with the wrong names.”</p>
<p>“Wrong names?”</p>
<p>“If it’s not called soap, but a ‘cleansing bar’ that means it’s so loaded with crud that they weren’t legally allowed to call it soap. That shit is gold to us, because the chemicals in it mean it <em>lasts</em>. If it lasts, it can be resold back home.”</p>
<p>“Soap goes bad?”</p>
<p>“It can. I’d rather take the misnamed shit that lasts than take something more legit home and find out it went bad.”</p>
<p>“Good point.”</p>
<p>“We’ll teach you all the tricks. It’s a good gig, believe me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Hey, are those fridges?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I wouldn’t get your hopes up. Power was probably out for months to a year before someone got this building back on line.”</p>
<p>“You think they have ice cream? Or those push-freezes?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want ice cream, remember? You want&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Frozen dairy-like desserts or something.”</p>
<p>“Now you get it.”</p>
<p>Dot watched as the younger man jogged across the floor to what was almost certainly his imminent demise. He opened the glass door to the fridge display and began picking his way through cardboard boxes.</p>
<p>She could see the green lights appearing in the background of the display, flicking on one by one, apparently at random.</p>
<p>The older man noticed, stopping in his tracks.</p>
<p>“Jackson!” he screamed the word.</p>
<p>The machine rammed through the wall. Six feet tall, six feet wide, with two legs, it slammed past metal racks, past food in cardboard boxes, through the glass doors, through the metal that the doors were attached to, and into Jackson.</p>
<p>Both legs broken. From the way he hit the ground, his arm might have been broken too.</p>
<p>One mechanical leg thrust out, then dragged Jackson back into the hole in the wall. Another reached out and began depositing a thin white fluid on the bloodstain.</p>
<p>Jackson’s mentor was running and the machine was just starting to clean up the blood when two more belatedly thrust their way out through the walls. They paused where they were, seemed to decide what they were doing, and then used wheels on their underbellies to roll along the floor, the two forelimbs out and ready.</p>
<p>Gaps appeared in the face of each machine as they drew closer. Jackson’s mentor shouted to friends elsewhere in the building as he rounded a corner in the shelves and stacks.</p>
<p>He made the mistake of grabbing onto a metal strut at the edge of one set of shelves. The face of the strut moved, changing in angle, and jerked upward. A machine had taken a blade and camouflaged it to look like the red-painted metal surface, and it managed to carve deep into Jackson’s mentor’s hand. The machine that controlled the blade moved. It wore a cardboard box.</p>
<p>Dot made a mental note of that as she remained frozen, watching.</p>
<p>The people were running, gathering together. They narrowly evaded the machines, using corners and their small size to stay clear as the machines from the fridge wall careened down the wide aisles.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter. They were already dead.</p>
<p>She could hear the gasps and shrieks. Here and there, weapons were deployed. Sprays of darts, more blades from innocuous surfaces, wire.</p>
<p>The gasps became more numerous, the sounds strained, and the activity of the scavengers slowed. The ones who realized what was happening didn’t have the words to report it to the others.</p>
<p>Gas. Invisible, odorless. They gasped and used everything they had to try to draw air into their lungs, but the machines were putting something heavier than oxygen on the ground floor of the store. Now they drowned.</p>
<p>Dot had lost family to this very same thing. She had seen how painful it was, and she had known how painful it was to watch someone she cared about die that way.</p>
<p>She took her time picking through the boxes of vitamins, putting them in her bag. It was nice that the gummy vitamins didn’t rattle. She picked up other things as she navigated the shelves, including bandages and some random bottles.</p>
<p>An explosion drew her attention.</p>
<p>Someone in a costume.</p>
<p>Another explosion, followed by two more, and one of the big machines from the fridge wall collapsed.</p>
<p>Apparently alerted by one of the dying, the woman in costume climbed up onto the shelving units, to get to higher ground where there was air. She threw a blue light out of her hand, and it detonated on impact with the next machine.</p>
<p>Back at the fridges, some of the fridges and surrounding wall had already been reconstructed. Two more of the large cube-shaped machines squeezed through the gaps in the wall that were still there, before getting their wheels under them and hurrying in the direction of the woman in costume.</p>
<p>Dot moved closer to the ground to get a look. It was important to know just how far gone this building was.</p>
<p>The entire area behind the fridges was gone. Green flashing lights, wires, computers and metal twisted into shapes that helped it to provide a framework. Machines were working slowly and steadily to refine and develop things.</p>
<p>In the opposite corner of the building, the hero climbed behind a stack of cans. A spray of flechettes punctured the paper with no resistance&mdash; there was no tin to the cans, only the labels and the haphazardly perched tops. The machines had already collected everything and then put things back so it looked like it hadn’t been touched.</p>
<p>The heroine fell and hit the floor. She had been darted, punctured across the face and shoulder.</p>
<p><em>You die too</em>, Dot observed.</p>
<p>Against all odds, though, the heroine had managed to hold her breath. She got to her feet and she ran.</p>
<p>Dot climbed carefully, avoiding suspicious surfaces as she navigated the piles. She kept one eye out for things she could use and one eye on the heroine.</p>
<p>A box cutter, left on the surface by a past employee. Useful. Dot grabbed it.</p>
<p>One of the machines shifted position. Two legs on the ground in front of it, backside resting on the ground. Its face opened wide, and a salvo of missiles fired forth. Ten, twelve, metal canisters with streams of vapor painting the air in their wake as they flew in lazy arcs or even tumbled through the air before getting their bearings.</p>
<p>However haphazard they looked, they didn’t hit anything they weren’t supposed to. They traced courses between stacks of pasta and boxes of cereal, through the struts of metal shelves, and through the two-inch gaps between shelf and the floor below.</p>
<p>The heroine shot at shelves, bringing down the contents in showers that might block the missiles. Some missiles detonated. Others navigated the falling debris, and the heroine shot at those next.</p>
<p>Some missiles didn’t detonate, but they weren’t missiles in actuality. They were <em>tricks</em>.</p>
<p>The heroine backed up, then saw the two new arrivals, two more of the big ‘soldier’ machines. She ran for the door.</p>
<p>But the machines had had her since she had let them know she existed.</p>
<p>The heroine made it to the door, and then a metal skewer harpooned her hand.</p>
<p><em>Blow it up. Lose the hand</em>, Dot thought. She realized she was rooting for the heroine despite herself.</p>
<p>The heroine fought, and she’d had to stop running to fight. More skewers impaled her forearm, then her other hand.</p>
<p>She used her power, she shot at shelves, but she lacked the angle. The machines reeled in, using the wires attached to the skewers, and the heroine was hauled into the air, arms out to either side, legs dangling.</p>
<p>Dot sat, and she waited. She ate more gummy multivitamins and she observed the machines. She watched as the mess was slowly cleaned up, boxes pulled back into position, products lined up, and sections of floor that had been shattered by missiles were fit together like jigsaw pieces.</p>
<p>Here and there, deep in the craters and crevices, the ‘trick’ missiles had delivered payloads that weren’t explosive. They looked like veins of metal in rock. In weeks and months, they would ‘hatch’, revealing the machinery that had built itself within. For now, they were paved over. Smaller machines filled in cracks with something white that would harden, with daubs of black for the speckles in the tile. A blade scraped away the excess, and a small nozzle provided a covering of dust to match surrounding floor.</p>
<p>A close eye would notice where the floor was different, but it would have to be close and careful.</p>
<p>The machines weren’t too challenging to destroy. Dot’s groups had sometimes destroyed them. The trick was that they set in roots wherever they went. Each time they reached a new place, they would keep emerging from that place, from walls and floor and rock and tree. It took care and attention to get the machine out of each of those things, and while that care was being taken, machines elsewhere would emerge, march, and make inroads along the flanks.</p>
<p>Green lights here and there went dark, the machines hibernating. Dot deemed herself safe to move.</p>
<p>She stuck to the high ground, while the still-active machines continued their work below. She eased herself closer to the heroine, and paused, observing. Here and there, the woman kicked or struggled, and the machines didn’t respond. Blood streamed down and dripped from her toes to her floor. Each time blood accumulated enough to drip and make a small splash on the floor, a machine zoomed out to spray at it and then wiped it away before returning to its hiding place beneath a shelf.</p>
<p>Dot leaped. She landed on the woman’s shoulder, and the woman’s face twisted, contorting into a wordless scream at the sudden, added weight on her injured arms and hands.</p>
<p>Then the woman looked at Dot, and her expression changed again. Fear, alarm.</p>
<p>Dot was small, only about as large as the woman’s head, and she was colorful. Her clothes had been stolen from dolls and pieced together with diligent care. Her tail with its fur tuft on the end swished with the box-cutter it held..</p>
<p>“Help me.”</p>
<p>Dot shook her head.</p>
<p>“I have people who are counting on me. I have a sick sibling, they need me to bring in the money from this work.”</p>
<p>“I have people too,” Dot whispered. She stuck her tongue up to pick her nose, then drew it back into her mouth. “Some sick too.”</p>
<p>The heroine made a small sound, bowing her head. “I’ll help you, I’ll&mdash; I’ll convince people to give you medical care. We can trade.”</p>
<p>Dot reached out with one hand, and she pushed the tab that extended the blade from the box-cutter.</p>
<p>“I’ll do anything,” the heroine said.</p>
<p>Dot paused.</p>
<p>“Anything,” the heroine said, seizing on the pause.</p>
<p>“My king,” Dot said. “Where?”</p>
<p>“Your king?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I can take you.”</p>
<p>“No you can’t,” Dot said. She hugged the box cutter against her chest with two spotted arms, red spots on yellow-white flesh. “You die here. I’m not big or strong. Machines are. If I go for help then you dead before I’m back.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>“Tell me where my king is and I’ll be fast. Merciful.”</p>
<p>“I don’t&mdash; this isn’t about me. Can you&mdash; can you let them know the Machine Army is this far north? They shouldn’t be on this side of the Raleigh chasm.”</p>
<p>“They kill me on sight.”</p>
<p>“Find a way? Please? I’ll tell you where your king is, I help you, but you need to tell them. We need the Wardens to stop them before they get their roots in.”</p>
<p><em>Too late,</em> Dot thought to herself.</p>
<p>The woman seemed to take it as assent, when it wasn’t. “The Wardens’ headquarters, probably. It’s&mdash; it’s on Gimel, where a lot of the trains go. The train nearest here goes there. You’ll want to look for a building with a statue of a knight with a sword at the front.”</p>
<p>Dot took a two-handed grip on her box cutter.</p>
<p>“Tell the Wardens. Let them know, so they can take measures. Tell them Burnish said it. It might save your King’s life.”</p>
<p>Dot paused.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>Then she cut into the woman’s throat, until blood sprayed from the artery. She opened her mouth wide, until the teeth on the upper half of her mouth pointed in the same direction as the teeth on the lower jaw, and bit in deep, locking her mouth in place. She swallowed the blood, gorging herself.</p>
<p>Vitamins, protein, nourishment. She would fill herself here, then visit her brothers and sisters. Then she would set out on her quest.</p>
<p>A distance below them, machines washed away the blood. After the heroine had been kept up and out of the way long enough to ensure her power wouldn’t be a problem, she would be cleaned up too.</p>
<p>Dot felt energized, her focus as sharp as the box-cutter. She knew where their king was.</p>
<p>King Rinke. Nilbog.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>She clung to the underside of the train. The ground was a blur beneath her, periodically studded with rocks and branches.</p>
<p>Those of her kind who ventured into the human’s civilization didn’t tend to return. She knew it was a risk. She knew she had a one percent chance when it came to this. She’d said her goodbyes accordingly.</p>
<p>Blackspot would be left in charge. He’d been unwell lately, and he might be too unwell to lead their group. He was thirteen and that made him old, and after their discussion, her communicating in broken English and gesture and him communicating in chirp, he’d agreed. She suspected he’d made the decision because he hoped she would bring their king back somehow. It was Blackspot’s only chance at being recycled and made into new life.</p>
<p>Lump would be second in command. Lump had been injured a year ago, after running into humans. He barely moved now. When he died, the group would be more free to move, but they wouldn’t leave him behind until then.</p>
<p>Lump was one of the only big ones that were left.</p>
<p>Dot used her tail to fish out a gummy vitamin from inside her tunic where it sat close to her belly. It stuck to her skin and had to be peeled away. She chewed it slowly and carefully.</p>
<p>She was thirsty. She hadn’t anticipated how dehydrated she would get. The chewing got her saliva flowing, though some unfortunately flowed out through the corners of her wide mouth.</p>
<p>There was a hole that smelled like shit, leading into the train interior, but she didn’t want to climb up into there. Shit didn’t bother her, but the smell would hurt her ability to stay undetected.</p>
<p>She was a scout and a spy, a messenger to a king in captivity.</p>
<p>She would endure. She clung to the bolts and bars, arching her back when she saw a branch or rock that might scrape at her, and she chewed.</p>
<p>The train slowed. She shifted her position, ears reorienting to catch more sound. Every detail she could pick up would matter, now. She was in hostile territory.</p>
<p>The train rolled to a stop. Doors hissed as they opened, and the crowd began to make their way out. Dot peered between the wheels and up, to see the refugees and the scavengers, as well as the men and women and boys and girls in uniforms who came and went.</p>
<p>She dropped to the tracks, and she moved to the dark corner, crawling through the dust and grime to help cover up the color of her spots and outfit.</p>
<p>Too many for her to slip across the platform. Would she have an opening? She crept along, looking for vents, for cracks, or anything where she could slip through.</p>
<p>Too new a building, too maintained. This was nothing like the kingdom or the ruins she had known during her five years of existence.</p>
<p>The only time she had seen this many humans was when their kingdom had been invaded. She had been aware as each set of humans boarded at different stops, but for all of them to get off here, for there to be no more tracks? This had to be the end. Their destination and hers.</p>
<p>She trembled with anticipation as the stream of people from the train slowed.</p>
<p>Boots were more serious than shoes. Matching boots were most serious. She associated matching boots with the men with guns that worked with the people in costume. When men with matching boots and people in costume got together, it was often to kill her kind.</p>
<p>She would save her king.</p>
<p>She crept along the underside of the ledge, where the platform jutted toward the train. When the train left, would she be exposed?</p>
<p>She would do anything for her king.</p>
<p>Her weapon was ready. The box cutter. It still smelled like the blood of the heroine. Of Burnish.</p>
<p>Thinking of the blood made her think again about how thirsty she was.</p>
<p>“Christ,” one of the boots said. “Incoming.”</p>
<p>Someone else groaned.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon,” a woman said.</p>
<p>“Afternoon,” was the curt response.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a thtowaway.”</p>
<p>Dot froze.</p>
<p>“A thtowaway?” was the response. There was a sound of an impact, light.</p>
<p>“Thomething thmall.”</p>
<p>“Is this like when you had us stop the train, put the entire city on hold, made us get the bomb disposal bot under the train with a camera, all to show us some squirrel roadkill caught in the machinery?”</p>
<p>“I’m here for a reathon. Thith ith what I do.”</p>
<p>“Every time you jerk our chains you lose trust, and you’ve jerked our chains a lot. You haven’t done much to regain that lost trust.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t jerk your chain, Adam,” the woman said. “I thpecialithe in noticing thmall thingth, and I know how thmall and thort your chain is.”</p>
<p>There was laughter.</p>
<p>Dot wondered if she had any options. There hadn’t been anything she could use to disguise herself as roadkill. What would she do if the train started moving?</p>
<p>“Can you actually see short, uh, chains?” another woman asked.</p>
<p>“No comment.”</p>
<p>“I think we have a camera we can drop to the track. It should be up at the station proper. We can do a quick search. You want to grab it, Adam?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make a call, ask them to keep the train put while we search. Stay close, Rat?”</p>
<p>“The name’th Ratcatcher. I’ll thtay clothe.”</p>
<p>Dot made her way along the car, until she found one of the holes near the shit-hole. This hole didn’t lead up into the car, there was a grate barring her way, catching hair and other gunk, but it was just wide enough for her to squeeze most of the way into.</p>
<p>She waited, listening, until she heard the clatter.</p>
<p>Her role in the community had been a scout, to start with. She had ended up a leader after a while, but she was still a scout at heart. Exploring new places, figuring out ways to deal with traps, with the enemies that lurked out there.</p>
<p>She had dealt with the Machine Army. This little toy wouldn’t stop her.</p>
<p>With clawed toes and the opposable toe on her foot, she clawed some of the hair out of the drain.</p>
<p>Patience. Care. Machines were predictable, once they had revealed their tricks. The challenge was to find the tricks without being discovered or caught.</p>
<p>She watched as the machine passed under her. Dropping from her hiding place, almost noiseless, she landed right behind it. She used all of her strength to tip it over, then wrapped the hair around the wheel and reached up, tying it to a bit of metal at the base of the hole, where a passing rock or branch had made the metal rougher.</p>
<p>Snagged, caught, but in a believable way.</p>
<p>She darted away, as voices commented on the situation, trying to riddle out what had happened. A human dropped down between the platform and the train itself, ducking low to peer between wheels, looking for the little camera drone.</p>
<p>The platforms were mostly empty, and most of the watchful eyes were focused on the little drone and the issue.</p>
<p>She stuck her head up, ears low and close to her body, tail swishing beneath her, and then made a break for a vent.</p>
<p>A human moved, making a run for her. Shoes slid on the smooth floor of the station platform as the human put herself between Dot and the vent.</p>
<p>“Not so fatht,” the woman said, as Dot skidded on the floor, stopping.</p>
<p>The woman was small, as humans went, and she wore a costume that covered most of her body. Her mask was roughly cone-shaped, but the paper or wire that kept the mask pointy had been dented or damaged at one point, and the nose drooped a bit. Rodent-like, with ears sticking out and back at the side, flat against the side of her head. The eyes behind the eye-holes were large, dark, and moist. If Dot unfocused her eyes a bit, it looked like there was nothing behind the eyeholes. Dark hair draped around in front of the ears and down the back of the woman’s head. As pointy as the mask was, she wore a hood or a hat with a point going the opposite direction.</p>
<p>She wore a jacket, denim, with a threadbare collar, a striped shirt beneath, and a thin chain belt with mousetraps dangling from it. Her socks were striped as well, extending high enough that they just barely met her denim cut-off shorts.</p>
<p>Dot was willing to admit that if she was going to die, at least it was at the hands of someone with a good aesthetic.</p>
<p>“You thall not path,” Ratcatcher said.</p>
<p>Dot remained where she was, frozen.</p>
<p>“Can you talk?” Ratcatcher asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Dot said.</p>
<p>“I like your colorth.”</p>
<p>Dot stretched out her hands in front of her, looking at her arms.</p>
<p>“I bet you’re beautiful when clean,” Ratcatcher said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Dot said. She was. She wasn’t interesting looking, but she could talk and she could use her hands, feet, and tail, well, and she had some pretty patterns: her namesake spots.</p>
<p>“I want you to go home,” Ratcatcher said. “If we fight, I’ll win. I thpecialize in dealing with your type.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to deliver message,” Dot said. “That all.”</p>
<p>“What methage?”</p>
<p>“Burnish. She went to a store. Machine Army was there. She wanted me to tell. North of the Raleigh chasm. They were surprised.”</p>
<p>“We thought it was your people,” Ratcatcher said.</p>
<p>“No,” Dot said. “I watched.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t help?”</p>
<p>“Too small, too weak.”</p>
<p>“That’th no ekthuthe. Burnith was a good one. Nice to me. I’ll mith her.”</p>
<p>Dot remained where she was. She looked back. No sign that the men who were investigating under the train even realized she wasn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your methage.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go now,” Dot said. “But can I have water? I’m so thirsty.”</p>
<p>“Come. Vending machine. Have you theen thethe?”</p>
<p>Dot had, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>Ratcatcher held out a hand. Dot was wary, but she ventured closer.</p>
<p>“Thay hello to Raththputin,” Ratcatcher said. “Thtay in my pocket for now.”</p>
<p>In another time, another world, Dot might have stayed.</p>
<p>But she had a king to rescue. A king adored by his people. A truly great man.</p>
<p>As Ratcatcher reached into a pocket, change jingling, Dot saw opportunity. She leaped for the ground, went under the vending machine, and then ran along the wall, darting for the vent.</p>
<p>Big people were often slow. Ratcatcher wasn’t. Fast reflexes. Fast in general.</p>
<p>But Dot was faster. Had the vent not already had a corner peeled away, Dot wouldn’t have been able to make it inside. As it was, she ducked inside, and Ratcatcher’s gloved fingers only managed to seize the ends of the hairs at the end of Dot’s tail. Dot hauled herself free.</p>
<p>Ratcatcher moved her mask aside, fingers going to her mouth, and then whistled. “Trouble!”</p>
<p>But Dot was already in her element.</p>
<p>She ran through dusty vents, navigating the guts of the building. Flashlights periodically shone into the vents, illuminating areas. She avoided most of those beams of lights, going this way and that, until she found another convenient point, where two pieces of metal weren’t flush together. She squeezed through and pulled her bag after her.</p>
<p>It was another minute until she realized two things.</p>
<p>Ratcatcher had friends.</p>
<p>The convenient openings in the vents and leading from vent to the inside of the walls of the station were there because of those friends.</p>
<p>Dot had dealt with rats before, but these rats were the sort that were very ugly and very large. In the right light, they might have been mistaken for very ugly, small dogs. Dot had always liked that story when the King read it from the scary children’s book. The children got the dog and the dog turned out to be a Mexican sewer rat.</p>
<p>These rats were that sort, apparently, and they smelled like Ratcatcher’s pocket had.</p>
<p>She drew her box-cutter, extending the blade, and sized up her opponents.</p>
<p>Three rats against her and her boxcutter.</p>
<p>It might have been an even fight, but she had her devotion to her king on her side.</p>
<p>She would rescue her king.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The building that held her king was fitting for the stories. The statue lacked color, but it had the right atmosphere. She was bleeding but she told herself that this was how things were in those stories. The heroine at the foot of the castle of the evil empire, the king in captivity. She hurt from the battles already fought and faced the greatest challenge yet.</p>
<p>Getting inside wasn’t hard, but getting <em>up</em> was. The vents were barred and had cameras, and people were already on guard when she arrived, keeping a close eye on those same vents.</p>
<p>She could only wait.</p>
<p>Patience was essential to a scout. The fact that every inch of her hurt from her fight with the sewer rats made the patience a little different. She had been hurt before, and she had been hurt in a way that made each breath an effort.</p>
<p>Breathe in, breathe out. If she did that once, she was one step closer to being better and being okay. She knew it was a long journey, but surviving was important.</p>
<p>Surviving was especially important now.</p>
<p>He was close.</p>
<p>She would free him, and he would usher in a new age of greatness for her and her people. She might even have a place at his side, where she could be close to him at all times.</p>
<p>She wasn’t even sure what that would be like. She had been ecstatic when she had seen mere glimpses of him, back in the old Kingdom.</p>
<p>Breathe in, hurt, breathe out, hurt again, feel the scratches and the bites when she shifted position. Breathe in, breathe out, double check she wasn’t anywhere she might be found.</p>
<p>She licked at her wounds, and she licked at the dust and grit, so her colors would be bolder. She licked her hands and ran wet hands over her hair, smoothing it.</p>
<p>She had arrived early in the morning, on the train, and now she waited until the sun was high in the sky. Each breath was a step closer to wellness and moving again.</p>
<p>She dug in her small pack for the bandages. They were the small kind, with sticky sides. She had brought the colorful ones with cartoons on them for luck, and now she placed them over her wounds, along with little bits of cotton and fabric to soak up the blood.</p>
<p>It seemed like there were more people who came and went than there were stars in the sky, but her senses might have been playing tricks on her.</p>
<p>The trickle of people slowed. When some made early returns, they smelled like food. Midday meals, then. She waited until everyone was back and working, sluggish from the food in their bellies, and then she made her move.</p>
<p>Up the underside of the stairs to the second floor. Into a crack between a booth and the wall. Up to the third floor, in a similar way.</p>
<p>There was security guarding the way from the fourth floor to the fifth. A commotion gave her a chance to slip through. It helped that she was small and it helped more that she was experienced.</p>
<p>Now she explored. The fifth floor didn’t seem much like a prison. The sixth was closer, with more security, more computers, more monitors.</p>
<p>She heard a voice, and she caught a familiar name.</p>
<p>“…Rinke.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the point. He’s a broken man.”</p>
<p>Dot clutched at her chest, just over her heart.</p>
<p>“He’s a great man. Him being broken or not broken doesn’t change that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the point, Riley. I don’t think I’d gain anything, and I don’t think the people I care the most about would be very happy about me hanging around with him.”</p>
<p>“You hang around with <em>me</em>.”</p>
<p>“Someone has to check your work.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. I’m going to go talk to him. I think you should join us. You can check my work after, we’ll make it fast.”</p>
<p>The pair started to walk away. Dot checked the coast was clear, then followed.</p>
<p>Up to the seventh floor, then higher. Her body ached, every one of her movements harder than they had been before she had started climbing up to the top of this monstrous building, but she knew she was close.</p>
<p>A dining hall, with lots of tables, and a kitchen off to one side. It smelled like a hundred different foods.</p>
<p>The two girls didn’t talk much as they walked. The younger one was on the cusp of adulthood, but she smelled like blood and sickness. She was blonde, wearing a dress.</p>
<p>The older one had crossed the threshold to adulthood. Her arms were striped or marked somehow, almost completely covered with freckles, and her brown hair was tied back into a ponytail. She wore jeans and a top with spaghetti straps, and had a jacket folded over her arms, which she held close to her body.</p>
<p>“You don’t find it sad? Spending time around him like this?”</p>
<p>“Sad?” Riley asked. “No. It’s… reassuring.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“It’s a crazy, fucked up, upside-down, inside-out world. I think he understands that. He lives in that world. Not in a fantasy version of it.”</p>
<p>“It seems to me like he lives entirely in the fantasy.”</p>
<p>Riley chuckled.</p>
<p>There was another security checkpoint. The two passed through, and Dot was forced to hang back, watching them go through. She couldn’t pass herself. It was sealed off like the old kingdom had been. What was the word?</p>
<p>Quarantined.</p>
<p>She found vents, and she climbed through the vents. The vents, too, were quarantine-sealed.</p>
<p>She hated that she was so close. Her king was in arm’s reach, and she couldn’t touch him. He was talking, right this moment, and she couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p><em>Patience</em>, she told herself.</p>
<p>Patience. A scout had to know patience. She was here to free him, to give him power again, even if it meant him taking her apart and turning her into another kind of life that he could use. Achieving that goal had always been something that would take time.</p>
<p>She searched vents, and she found one that had a gap she could use. She worked at it, wedging her box-cutter into the gap and wiggling it until she could get fingers in the gap. She used strength to widen it further, felt air escape through the rubber seal she’d peeled away, and knew she’d broken through the quarantine protection.</p>
<p>With more work, she was able to get an entire arm through. Screws scraped against metal as she worked them through.</p>
<p>She found her way into the walls, and from the walls, she found her way to a double-layered window with wire mesh between layers. She could see glimpses of the scene from an angle, distorted, by peering through the side of the thick glass pane.</p>
<p>The girl and the woman sitting at a table, separated from King Rinke by another thick glass wall.</p>
<p>Almost frantic, Dot searched the interior of the walls, looking for gaps, anything she could use. Everything was sealed, everything secured.</p>
<p>The answer ended up being the power outlet. She worked at the outlet, clawed at the seal that cemented it to the wall, and moved it enough that sound could get through. Later, when it was quiet, she could get through too.</p>
<p>“…a Red Queen and an Alice, then.”</p>
<p>“Or you could call me by my name.”</p>
<p>“I’m quite fond of Alice. She was a chaotic force in the worlds she visited, you know. She questioned, she challenged. A revolutionary in absurd worlds held captive by their own conventions and riddles.”</p>
<p>“This supposed Red Queen and I are friends, you know,” Alice Riley said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’d go that far,” the Red Queen said.</p>
<p>“They were friends and enemies both in the story,” King Rinke said.</p>
<p>“You know, Jamie, I told the Queen here that you were one of the people who really <em>got it</em>. I drew comparisons to our friend Valkyrie. The Queen and Valkyrie know each other, you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m flattered by the comparison, my Alice. I’m not surprised they know each other. Queens are well-connected.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting sort of sick of being called a Queen.”</p>
<p>“My dear, you have all the power in the world. You can move in any direction you choose.”</p>
<p>“Less than you’d think.”</p>
<p>“You’re here, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’m… I think if I’m here, it’s because I’ve been checkmated by <em>her</em>. She implied she’d waste my time if I didn’t go along with this.”</p>
<p>“It’s very, very easy for even a Queen to be checkmated, if she doesn’t act like a Queen.”</p>
<p>“I’m starting to think I’m not smart enough to keep up with this conversation.”</p>
<p>Riley the Alice laughed.</p>
<p>“You should visit again, Red Queen. Have tea. Keep an old man company.”</p>
<p>“You’re more than an old man,” the Alice said.</p>
<p>“A king without a kingdom,” King Rinke said.</p>
<p>“A fallen king is still a king,” the Alice said.</p>
<p>King Rinke tittered. Dot, hiding in the wall, smiled at the expression of joy.</p>
<p>“Yes, I do remember that,” King Rinke said.</p>
<p>“We should go soon,” the Alice said. “We’ve finished our tea, and we’ve got work to do. The Red Queen needs to check over the, ah, vial I’ve created that says ‘drink me’, and make sure it’s safe.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t make anything like that,” the Queen said. “I’d hate to see it go wrong.”</p>
<p>“My work doesn’t go wrong. Thank you very much. It was wonderful to see you, Goblin King. I’m sorry the visit was short. I mostly wanted to introduce you two.”</p>
<p>“It’s been an experience,” the Queen said.</p>
<p>“What’s next for you, Red Queen? What will you do, once you’ve seen what our Alice has been up to?”</p>
<p>“I’ll… I guess I’ll be at my father’s side while talking to some of the most powerful people in all the known worlds, and I’ll see my parents, trying to say goodbye and yet unable to pull away, or making my greetings and being pushed away, and I’ll continue to feel like I’m in the wrong places every step of the way.”</p>
<p>“You’re a <em>queen</em>. You have such power. You can go anywhere you want, if you’re willing to wield that power. Your struggles are because you’re trying to be something you aren’t. Take that as advice from a king who has lost his kingdom to a Queen who has yet to claim hers.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like what happens when I try to use power to claim anything.”</p>
<p>“Then use <em>position</em>. The fact that you’re a queen affords you power by default. If you stand in the right places, things will change as a result. Use that. Recognize it. Things may start going the way you hope they might.”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“I’ve said similar things,” the Alice said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” the Queen said. “I worry because the only people willing to talk to me say similar things, but I’m not sure they’re people I should listen to.”</p>
<p>“A king without a kingdom,” King Rinke said.</p>
<p>“Let’s go with that,” the Alice said. “That’s probably it.”</p>
<p>There was a slight commotion, chairs moving, dishes clacking against surfaces, as the girl and the woman gathered themselves together and stood from their seats.</p>
<p>“Come again, Red Queen.”</p>
<p>“I can’t make promises, but I’ll be in the building a lot, and it’s not out of the realm of possibility.”</p>
<p>There were more noises, and then doors shut.</p>
<p>Knees pulled to her chest, tail wrapped around her, Dot felt warm and happy, her king’s words wrapped around her, filling her up.</p>
<p>She barely dared to move the outlet, to force her way past it, to break the spell and to try to have more.</p>
<p>But she had to save her king.</p>
<p>The King had a bodyguard, a strong soldier of a man, taller than the King, muscular, and clearly dumb. The bodyguard noticed her before the King did, and reached out to touch the King’s arm.</p>
<p>“Ah,” King Rinke said. He had a sad expression on his face. “They’ve been watching me closer for the better part of the morning. I suppose you’re why.”</p>
<p>Dot wasn’t sure what to say or do.</p>
<p>“Come. Can you talk?” he asked. He seated himself, his bodyguard reaching for the chair to steady it as the King sat. The King stuck one leg straight out in Dot’s direction.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said. She leaped forward in the same way and lurching way her heart leaped into her chest. She ran up and along his leg, up him, to him. Clawed fingers and feet clutched for the fabric of his shirt. His gray-touched beard tickled her head and back.</p>
<p>She could smell him and he smelled like home, like family and love. She felt his hand on her back, and she felt it pet her.</p>
<p>She could have cried, if she weren’t so dehydrated, if so much of her body’s energies and fluids hadn’t gone into bleeding and healing. Every ache and pain, from hours of clinging to a shuddering train to fighting rats and scaling a building interior, prying her way past sealed building fixtures, it became a dull, throbbing reassurance that she’d done right.</p>
<p>“You worked hard to get here.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’re the third to get this far. One of only two that could talk.”</p>
<p>Third? She wanted to ask, but she was worried about the response.</p>
<p>“I didn’t make you, did I? You were birthed. You look like Polka’s get.”</p>
<p>She nodded, hard, head rubbing against his shirt as she clutched tighter. He <em>knew</em> her. He didn’t know her but he knew where she was from and so he knew her.</p>
<p>“Polka the third?”</p>
<p>“Fourth,” she said. “But thank you for thinking I’m like the third. She was the most beautiful and clever.”</p>
<p>“The fourth was clever too,” he said. He stroked her.</p>
<p>“I come to save you,” she said. “You can use me for material.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” he said. “Not for one as beautiful and noble and brave as you. No.”</p>
<p>She felt the tears well up. <em>Noble</em>. Highest of praise.</p>
<p>“No,” he said again. He gave her a stroke, from head and ears to tail, and then he reached down, hands on her arms and shoulders, and he moved her back and away.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, a third time.</p>
<p>With that, she understood what he was saying no <em>to</em>.</p>
<p>“We need you.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“The others get sick and die. They want to be recycled.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “No, daughter of Polka. I’m too old, and I’m watched too closely. They’re watching and listening even now. We had our chance, and as our Kingdom stood on the brink of war, your king chose the wrong allies. The Alice that just visited me was one.”</p>
<p>Tears flowed now, but they weren’t tears of joy.</p>
<p>“We lost. I’m firmly in check.”</p>
<p>“But&mdash;”</p>
<p>“No,” he said. He stroked her, then held her firm with one hand around her shoulders, while he reached for his tea. Gently, carefully, he tipped it to her mouth. “Drink. You’re thirsty. You look exhausted. The caffeine will help.”</p>
<p>Dutifully, she drank.</p>
<p>“And then you should go. Go back. Find the others. Take care of them. Be gentle with humans you meet. So few of them understand power, and so many of them have so much, now.”</p>
<p>He moved the cup again, and she drank again.</p>
<p>She shifted her feet, placing them under her, and then stood, one foot on each of his legs.</p>
<p>She embraced him, arms in his beard, clutching at his shirt. His hand pressed against her back, and her tail wrapped around his wrist.</p>
<p>As quiet as she could manage, she whispered, “You say this because they’re listening. You must want to be free.”</p>
<p>She felt the hand at her back move, pulling her back and away again. She leaned against it, moving back so she could see his face.</p>
<p>She understood now, why the Alice had used the word ‘broken’.</p>
<p>“There are things I’ve talked to my Alice and the Valkyrie about, but reclaiming my kingdom or starting another anew isn’t in any of the many realms of possibility or fancy.”</p>
<p>“But&mdash;”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, one last time, and the look of pain in his eyes was proof to the word.</p>
<p>As she’d jumped to him as her heart had leaped with joy, she jumped away at the pain, both his and hers.</p>
<p>“Your name, child?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Dot.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Fitting, for the daughter of Polka.”</p>
<p>She nodded, but she didn’t feel like smiling.</p>
<p>“Go home, noble dot. Do us all proud. Tell the others whatever they need to hear.”</p>
<p>Her hand clutched at her chest, over her heart, and then she turned to go. Into the wall. Back the way she came. Every ache and cut and scrape felt magnified as hurt radiated through her.</p>
<p>Going down was as hard as going up had been, but this time she didn’t have anything to go <em>to</em>.</p>
<p>Back to Blackspot, with his sickness and his hope of being reborn? Back to Lump, who got weaker every day?</p>
<p>To tell them what?</p>
<p>More rats waiting for her, probably. Other things. More pain. More machines, inching into their territory.</p>
<p>As much as she hated to admit it, the others were dead. She was one of the strongest who were left, that she knew about. There were other tribes and groups, there were armies, but they fought for a kingdom that hadn’t had a king for a very long time.</p>
<p>Hurt and pain turned black and angry inside her.</p>
<p>She thought of the machines and she thought of Burnish’s words. The fact that warning people of the machines might save her king.</p>
<p>By the time she’d reached the sixth floor, moving slowly, the idea had found its root in her head, much like the the machines found root in rocks and metal, seeds of machinery that spun out and made it so a rock could crack like an egg, revealing gears and a thousand moving pieces. Machines that made machines, all hiding and deceiving and inching forward with endless patience.</p>
<p>Small things were capable. She had power of her own.</p>
<p>She needed purpose to drive her forward, and her purpose, the goal in her mind, was to go back to that store, to find a piece of machine, and then to put it on the train.</p>
<p>The machines would hatch in the heart of all the known worlds and the humans would lose their kingdom too.</p>
<p>It was that hate and thirst for vengeance that pushed her forward, now that she didn’t have her king to serve that role. Those feelings boiled up, leaving wet streaks on her cheeks as she crept forward, from hiding place to hiding place, shadow to shadow.</p>
<p>The stairs were tricky. From the sixth floor to the fifth floor, it was open area, trick to navigate. Someone sat on the stairs.</p>
<p>The Red Queen.</p>
<p>Dot settled in, finding a place to sit and wait. She watched the one the King had called a Queen, and she licked her wounds, both real and metaphorical. She wished she was interesting enough in design to lick her own heart.</p>
<p>Something, a huff of pain, a wheezing breath, a scuffle, it made the Queen look.</p>
<p>The pair locked eyes.</p>
<p>“We got a warning about you,” the Red Queen said. “You’re not getting up to trouble, are you?”</p>
<p>Dot shook her head.</p>
<p>“You’re hurt. Come here.”</p>
<p>Dot hesitated. Then she crept closer. She flinched as the Queen moved her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Move your hair aside. I’ll touch the side of your neck.”</p>
<p>Dot pawed at her hair, moving it. She felt the touch at her neck.</p>
<p>The pain around the cuts and the bites faded. The aches and sore joints sang with euphoria as they became normal and the endorphins that had flooded her body to help remained.</p>
<p>She reached out, with arms and tail, and wrapped herself around the Red Queen’s arm. She stared at the tattoos, black and red, tracing one hand along the ray of a sun. Not colorful enough, but… not bad. She had spots, too, but of a very different sort.</p>
<p>“Why are you sad?” the Red Queen whispered.</p>
<p>“My king doesn’t want me,” Dot said.</p>
<p>“Can I?” the Red Queen asked, moving her hand, and Dot saw. Dot nodded, and closed her eyes as the Red Queen stroked her. A different, lighter touch.</p>
<p>“I’m stuck too,” the Red Queen said. “I’ve finished my work for the day, but someone I’m supposed to stay away from is just downstairs. I think I know how it feels.”</p>
<p>“If I could have one thing only, I would have him close.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“As a friend or a master or a King or <em>anything</em>.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t.”</p>
<p>“And that anger of yours? What are we going to do about that?”</p>
<p>Dot might have been surprised, but King Rinke had called this woman a Queen and Queens were supposed to be capable of great things.</p>
<p>She kept her mouth shut. Amazed as she was, she wasn’t dumb.</p>
<p>“How about… in exchange for that healing I just gave you, you keep me company for a little while?”</p>
<p>Carefully, slowly, Dot crawled into the Red Queen’s lap.</p>
<p>The Red Queen stroked her, and each stroke was like the inhalation, the exhalation, the single step toward feeling a little bit better.</p>
<p>Even when the hand stopped moving, and rested on Dot’s shoulder, when Dot stared at the missing fingertips, she felt a little more okay.</p>
<p>They sat there, long after the coast was clear for the Red Queen. It was only when people came up the stairs that they were forced to move. The Red Queen moved Dot closer, putting on her jacket, and closed up the jacket so Dot was held close, and it was good, Dot’s ear pressed down to the Red Queen’s heart.</p>
<p>The Red Queen started down the stairs, one arm helping to keep Dot in position within her jacket.</p>
<p>“I’ll help you with your anger if you help me with mine.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap34">Shade &mdash; 4.1</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Ashley took her time exploring Hollow Point. Much of her attention was on the stores and the people within them. A store with supplies for those living on the fringes and in the tent cities, a used bookstore that was selling books taken from homes in the old world, ten dollars for a cardboard box full, a closed children’s clothing store.</p>
<p>The people that noticed Ashley were quick to avert their eyes or mind their own business.</p>
<p>She paused at a manicurist’s, looking within. There were rows of comfortable looking chairs with small tables beside them and foot baths below each seat. Ads in the window showed a variety of nail art.</p>
<p>Ashley held out her hand in front of her, her black nail polish contrasted with the colorful ‘Chevalier’ pattern, mimicking the delicate gold flourishes on a silver background. She moved her hand to compare to the ‘Alexandria’ image.</p>
<p>She stepped away and walked a little ways down the street. She peered into more closed buildings, passed a bar where the man at the counter pretended not to see her, and then walked by a clothing resale store. She paused at a clothing store, and then entered.</p>
<p>She looked through a series of black dresses and skirts, taking some off the rack and draping them over one arm.</p>
<p>“Ma’am?” the store employee asked. The young woman looked terrified. “Can I help you with anything?”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you know.”</p>
<p>“Please do. I’ll be at the counter.”</p>
<p>Ashley continued browsing, picking out an assortment of dresses, until she had eight gathered. She approached the change room and paused, looking at the sign that said only three articles of clothing could be brought into the changing area.</p>
<p>She entered the area, but didn’t step into any of the booths. Instead, she stood before the mirrors, holding dresses against her front. She paused as the front door opened, the bell jingling. A male voice asked a question, and the cashier said something in response.</p>
<p>She left six of the dresses where they were, and took two with her as she returned to the woman’s side of the store.</p>
<p>“Damsel of Distress,” the man said. He wore a mask with antlers at the corner, forking and extending into the wild locks of hair. He’d used face paint to blend his face into the mask, but the paint mixed multiple colors, with a golden sheen to the paint above his eyes and black on his lower eyelids and lower eye socket. He wore a jacket that wouldn’t have looked out of place in Robin Hood, with a stag’s head and a singular antler in gold, running from the collarbone, along the collar, and over one shoulder. “What brings you to Cedar Point?”</p>
<p>“Is it Cedar Point or Hollow point?”</p>
<p>“That depends on who you ask. Some of the more colorful locals prefer the latter.”</p>
<p>“The capes.”</p>
<p>“The capes. Yes. I’m guessing you’re here for them more than you’re here for the shopping.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to see what’s here,” she said. She turned away from him to pick through some clothes. She lifted the sleeve of a dress that was still on the rack, the dress was opaque, but the sleeve was sheer with a lace pattern worked into it.</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And I’m not impressed so far.”</p>
<p>“What did you expect to find that you’re not seeing?”</p>
<p>“Organization. A timely response to my arrival. I’ve been walking around for nearly half an hour and you’re the first person to show their face.”</p>
<p>“We prefer discretion.”</p>
<p>“It feels toothless. A sanctuary for villains, and you let people walk in here without stopping them?”</p>
<p>“We’ve been keeping a close eye on you.”</p>
<p>“Eyes aren’t teeth.”</p>
<p>“Some are, when you add powers to the mix. Shall we take this discussion outside?”</p>
<p>Ashley looked at the two dresses in her hand. She put one back where it belonged, and then approached the counter.</p>
<p>“Um,” the salesgirl said. “You can have it. It’s on the house.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“Store policy. The owner hopes that you’ll have a positive view of the store, in case of future trouble. Would you like a bag?”</p>
<p>Ashley looked at the dress, then shook her head, slinging the dress over one shoulder. She looked at the villain with the antlers. “We can talk outside.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be right with you.”</p>
<p>She walked out of the store, glancing over one shoulder to see him discreetly passing some bills to the salesgirl, who ducked her head in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The streets were mostly empty, without many cars, parked or otherwise. Some of the stores had tunnels or alleys that led to parking lots, but even those didn’t have many vehicles. Employee parking, when many stores had only one employee on average.</p>
<p>“I’m Prancer, by the by,” Prancer said, as he exited the store.</p>
<p>“The messenger.”</p>
<p>“I’m&mdash; no. Not a messenger,” he said. “If Cedar Point is anyone’s, it’s mine.”</p>
<p>“I was there when you first raised the idea of a gathering place.”</p>
<p>“Then you know what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>“I walked away halfway through your speech.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>A car pulled out of the alley, turned a corner, and then drove through the neighborhood, not slowing as it passed the pair.</p>
<p>“Normally when one villain visits another’s territory, there’s a token show of respect.”</p>
<p>“Normally,” Ashley said, “the person holding the territory does something to earn the respect. Normally, when someone brings up respect, they’re prepared to back up their words. Are you going to back up your words and give me some evidence that you deserve even a token show of respect?”</p>
<p>Prancer didn’t immediately reply. The two stared each other down.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be one of the difficult ones, it seems,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“If you’re relying on convention and expectation then yes, I am. If you show me you deserve my time and respect, I’ll give you it. If you think I’ll give it to you because you run this territory, you’ll be sadly disappointed. I might even supplant you.”</p>
<p>“That’s a dangerous game, Damsel of Distress. Making threats, forcing people to play their hands. You don’t know what cards someone has up their sleeves.”</p>
<p>“I have ideas. You appeared alone, no bodyguard, no backup. You appeared <em>late</em>. You can’t back up your reputation.”</p>
<p>“You might have the wrong ideas about the kind of territory this is.”</p>
<p>“Enlighten me,” Ashley said. It almost sounded like a threat.</p>
<p>“Come. Walk with me,” he said.</p>
<p>They started walking down the sidewalk, in a neighborhood where a third of the businesses were closed.</p>
<p>Prancer did the talking for the first leg of their walk. “Any community of capes will have its rules. Standards and things it does that benefit everyone in it. I’m not a warlord. I manage a very diverse group. If someone causes a problem, if someone <em>tests</em> us, I can and will give that diverse group direction or adjust the rules. I can and will point one of the many, many powers we have at our disposal here at that someone. Some are dangerous, some are devious, and some aren’t even parahuman kinds of powers.”</p>
<p>“Political.”</p>
<p>“Economic. Social,” Prancer said. “I might not be a warlord, I might not even be a warrior, but I have reach. A few words from me, and you might find it very hard to find work with a parahuman group. You might find that people won’t recruit you or do business with you.”</p>
<p>“Am I supposed to be concerned? I’m not looking to join any team, Prancer. I’m not looking to buy or sell petty drugs or prostitutes. When I decide to act, I’ll be <em>leading</em> a team, not joining one, and people will flock to me regardless of what you say. They’ll do business with me because there’s no other choice. I’m ready to call that bluff of yours.”</p>
<p>“And be the first I make an example of? No. I’m something of a schemer, a bit of a politician, and I’m a very good businessman. But if you’re going to deal with me, you should know that above any and all of that, I’m a <em>salesman</em>. If we’re talking about bluffs, I know bluffs when I see them, Damsel of Distress. I know you came here because you want something.”</p>
<p>“I did. I finished some shopping and I have your measure, and I have the measure of your neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“Something drew you away from your cozy apartment in an unassuming neighborhood, away from your regular appointments with therapists and the Wardens. Your years of history before Gold Morning are a pattern of laying low, being quiet, committing crimes to get food and clothes, and then getting restless and bored. That’s when you traditionally start stirring up trouble. Are you restless?”</p>
<p>“You read my files. If you’re expecting that level of access to intimidate me, you’ll be disappointed.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re bored. I know you’ve been hanging around the Cabin, or the Lodge if you want to call it that. I know you like spending time at the tea shop. I know that when you get restless you often look for people to spend time with. The Jewel of Boston, the Slaughterhouse Nine. We know how those stories ended.”</p>
<p>“I’m alive and many of them are dead.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how I would have put it, but alright,” Prancer said. “If you want something here, you should ask.”</p>
<p>“I thought I might want to find a place around here, but if you’re slow to respond to my arrival, you might be slow to stop heroes from getting in my way.”</p>
<p>“You want a place in the community?”</p>
<p>“And security, assurance I won’t be harassed. You know about the appointments. They’re why I’m left free when other ex-members of the Slaughterhouse Nine are still under lock and key. They study me then, I let them, and I want to leave it at that, for those days and those times only. I don’t want to be surveilled or scrutinized when I don’t have to be.”</p>
<p>“We have a variety of security measures in place. If you chose to move here, <em>if</em> we allowed you to, I think you’d be satisfied.”</p>
<p>“Empty assurances.”</p>
<p>“More robust assurances would come only when we knew we could trust you to some degree. Obviously, we’re not about to share particulars with a stranger. You could turn around and join a rival group and share that information with them.”</p>
<p>“And if I became less of a stranger, it would require an investment of time and trust. At that point it would be hard to escape. Sunken cost.”</p>
<p>“Then it seems we’re at an impasse.”</p>
<p>“So it seems.”</p>
<p>“And I can expect you to leave promptly, then.”</p>
<p>“I’ll leave when I’m ready,” Ashley said. She turned to walk in another direction, heading for another clothing store.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Switch to the overhead camera. I want to see what Prancer says and does.”</p>
<p>“I’ll project onto the other wall,” Kenzie said. “I want to keep the main camera on Ashley.”</p>
<p>She struck a few keys. One face of the projector box behind her desk lit up, projecting onto the wall. The image was blurry and badly affected by the light around the room at first, as any projector screen could be, but it swiftly clarified, crystallizing into an image as sharp as any flatscreen television. It was an overhead of the street.</p>
<p>The overhead image split, until that screen showed two camera views of Prancer at the same time, one directly overhead, and another that gave something of a view of his face.</p>
<p>The main camera, on the wall in front of and above Kenzie’s desk, showed Ashley’s point of view. The view bobbed with every step Ashley took, and was periodically obscured when Ashley blinked.</p>
<p>Tristan was bringing things into the room. The team’s temporary accommodation. Rain was in the corner, where a table had been set up, laying out parts of mechanical arms while Chris watched.</p>
<p>In the center of the room, Sveta, Natalie the law student and I watched things on the cameras.</p>
<p>Natalie had her arms folded. Her hair was shorter than most boys wore theirs, with a curl at the forehead, her glasses seemed oversized for her face, and her forehead was wrinkled in worry or concentration. She dressed in clothes that made me think she’d picked clothes out of a magazine without reading the rationale behind those clothes. She wore a blouse that fit her body closely, made of a faintly reflective material, with a black ribbon tied where it drew the collar together. She wore a straight-cut skirt that started at the waist and ended at the knee, and dark hose, with tidy, heel-less business shoes. It was the kind of thing that made a model in a magazine look <em>stunning</em>, but Natalie was five-foot two, she didn’t really have a waist, and the outfit made both of those things very obvious.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I think it would be very hard to explain to a judge why your agent took the free clothes from the store,” Natalie said. “I think you could explain it, but it feels like an implicit protection racket and that’s something that would be thrown in your faces.”</p>
<p>“Hey Tristan. Can I grab one of those whiteboards?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>The whiteboard didn’t have the legs or rollers attached yet, so Sveta held it upright for me. I wrote down the bit about taking the dress ‘on the house’.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the threatening tone, either. Entrapment has a pretty high bar, but if your agent threatens the targets, implicitly or explicitly, to insinuate herself into that environment, it casts a lot of it into jeopardy. They’ll turn around and say they had to do these things because a woman in black who can kill people by pointing at them was telling them to.”</p>
<p>I wrote it down. “We’ll tell her to tone it down. How long until we can communicate with her, Kenzie?”</p>
<p>Kenzie spun around in her computer chair, pulling her legs close to her chest to keep them out of the way of the desk’s edge. She stuck out a foot, kicking one of the boxes to the right of the desk. A bar appeared diagonally across it. “Sixty percent. Ummmm. Fifteen minutes until we can be totally sure they’re not tapped into cell towers or internet.”</p>
<p>“I actually have a lot of concerns about her as an undercover agent.”</p>
<p>“She’s not an undercover agent,” Tristan said. “She’s just there. Keeping an eye on things, keeping an ear out.”</p>
<p>“That’s an undercover agent,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“She isn’t joining any team or participating in anything,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“No espionage, no immediate risk,” Chris added his voice.</p>
<p>“I have concerns,” Natalie said. “I’ll just say that.”</p>
<p>Ashley was investigating a bookstore now, on the main screen. Our testing of the waters.</p>
<p>On the other screen, Prancer was meeting a trio of others.</p>
<p>Kenzie glanced at it and hit a key. Windows popped up, with three-dimensional models of each face, mask included. A young woman with a purple hood with nascent antlers sticking up through it, a skinny woman with rusty nails instead of teeth, and a woman in a white jacket with a doctor’s face mask.</p>
<p>I named them. “Velvet and Nailbiter. That <em>might</em> be Bitter Pill, but she hasn’t shown her face or been photographed any for the files. Is there sound?”</p>
<p>Kenzie hit a key on her keyboard. “It’s going to kill the flying camera’s battery. We get a minute or two and then I need to bring it home. Or we get three minutes and I bring it halfway home, and someone has to go over to pick it up wherever I land it.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“…up to?” Velvet asked, her voice playing from a speaker.</p>
<p>“Looking around. She was thinking of moving in, but she didn’t like how long it took us to turn up,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“She’s aware we were watching her, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“No. And she doesn’t give a shit, either. I outright told her and she was more concerned about the fact we hadn’t shown ourselves sooner. She’ll be a problem if she sticks around.”</p>
<p>“What kind of problem?”</p>
<p>Tristan, Rain, and Chris had stopped what they were doing and drew close, to listen and watch.</p>
<p>“She was quick to talk about supplanting the local leadership. We operate with a soft hand and she seems like the sort that respects only firm ones. There’s more to it, ties into something we’ve heard from… key voices. I’d rather have that conversation somewhere more private than this.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to deal with her?” Nailbiter asked, her words whistling through her teeth.</p>
<p>“No,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Why am I here then?”</p>
<p>“Because I think you and her are similar. You respect strength, you know how power works. You’ve dealt with scary customers. If we end up interacting with her more, and especially if she moves into the neighborhood, I think we want you to be on point, interacting with her more.”</p>
<p>“I can do that. She was Slaughterhouse?”</p>
<p>“Briefly, and you were Birdcage. I think a lot of the same principles apply.”</p>
<p>Nailbiter chuckled, a wheezy, whistling sound. “I never thought of that. Probably.”</p>
<p>“If this visitor of ours winds up being a problem, I don’t want you stepping into the fray against her.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Nailbiter asked.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t know how it would turn out. I’d rather make moves where I know the result in advance.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Nailbiter said.</p>
<p>Velvet made a sound, then drew closer to Prancer, putting her arm around him. He put his arm around her. “Not whatever. I like that kind of thinking.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“I’m curious what that thing is that you don’t want to talk about in the open,” Velvet said. “Can we go inside?”</p>
<p>“We can. You’re free to carry on with your day, Nailbiter. Thanks for coming. Pill, I want to ask you about some import-export work. Can you come?”</p>
<p>There was no sound from Bitter Pill, only a nod that the camera caught.</p>
<p>The group split up, Nailbiter walked away. The trio headed into an alleyway. The airborne camera moved, trying to get a view of the alley interior, and only saw a door close.</p>
<p>The image changed, as Kenzie typed. It showed an overhead map of the area. Kenzie marked the building they’d entered with a red highlight and a little flag icon, then began typing out a note.</p>
<p>“Can you get sound of building interiors?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Kind of not really,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“That’s real clear,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got one camera with good aerial camouflage that I really don’t want to get damaged because it took a whole weekend and a lot of stuff to put it together. I have two more that don’t have special camouflage, they’re just painted to match the sky, and I can only use them if the sky is the right color, or if I don’t mind them being spotted. They could get destroyed and I wouldn’t mind them breaking <em>that</em> much. It would take me something like two days to get more advanced sound built into any of them, and then I’m putting a lot of eggs in one basket or I’m making a disposable camera not so disposable.”</p>
<p>“But you <em>can</em> do it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m better with visuals, but yeah, I can do it.”</p>
<p>“Even if we decided it was worth building, it would take a while before you had that kind of microphone online,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It’s a sound camera, not a microphone,” Kenzie said. “But yeah. And I’m trying to figure out the teleporters and the longer ranged cameras and I’ve got to fix up some old stuff so it’s ready if we need it, and that’s all stuff I really <em>should</em> do, and if I’m doing that I’m not doing any of the fun stuff.”</p>
<p>Ashley, on her screen, paused to write something down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>LEAVING SOON</em></p>
<p>She used a small burst of her power to destroy the paper shortly after writing it down.</p>
<p>Kenzie snapshotted the note, then typed it up, adding it to a log in the sidebar, where it joined two other brief notes that Ashley had written on her way into Cedar Point.</p>
<p>“One thing I’ll say about Ashley?” Tristan said. “She’s provocative. From what I saw of that conversation, she impugned Prancer’s leadership right off, forced him to prove himself, gave us a sense of the power structure. She almost had him talking about anti-surveillance measures, but he’s being smart about keeping that mostly under wraps.”</p>
<p>“He probably has some we haven’t heard or talked about,” I said.</p>
<p>“She didn’t make any friends while she was doing all of that,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“We don’t need her to make friends,” Tristan said. “She’s not going undercover. Not explicitly. She’s just… there. Keeping an eye on things.”</p>
<p>I said, “My instinct is that if she keeps pushing on the level she was, people will get antsy or suspicious. It might be good to have her hang back, wait a bit before making contact or visiting again.”</p>
<p>“I could swing through,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“We should wait until we’re more settled,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“There are actually a few obstacles to figure out,” I said. “Sorry to take over the one whiteboard here.”</p>
<p>“We got a lot of the whiteboards because we thought we’d have one for each member of the team, and one for you, Victoria,” Rain said. “Two for Kenzie and two for me because we’re tinkers and you can never give tinkers too many surfaces to write stuff down on.”</p>
<p>“Yus,” Kenzie said. Her legs were kicking a mile a minute as she focused on her computers, a box to her right and the projector box on the far side of her desk, the camera images playing on the wall. One of the split-screen images showing the overhead of the building Prancer had entered turned red, blacked out, and then disappeared, shrinking down to leave the other image, which was tracking Nailbiter.</p>
<p>“Can you project the faces you had onto one of the whiteboards?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>Kenzie brought up images, then moved the projected image until it overlapped one side of the whiteboard. She had to look over one shoulder as she moved the mouse to make sure the image was in place.</p>
<p>Sveta dropped her hand, and used a tendril-wrapped marker to slowly trace out major facial features, hair, and the outlines of the masks for Prancer.</p>
<p>I looked at Natalie.</p>
<p>Natalie’s forehead, perpetually wrinkled, wrinkled further as she raised her eyebrows, looking from whiteboard to whiteboard, screen to screen. “I recommend moving slowly at first. I’ll give you some general, not-a-lawyer advice on things for free. It’s interesting and it’s relevant to what I want to do in the long run.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “That’s great. I’m not sure how slow the initial moves are going to be, though. The team needs to get some things out of the way before they have more freedom.”</p>
<p>Sveta turned her head. “The stuff Foresight said?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “We’re situated on the very outskirts of Cedar Point, here, and you can’t move into the area until a few hurdles are crossed. You can’t really have Ashley or Chris spend any extended time in the area until the Speedrunners, Birdbrain and Braindead are dealt with, and we can’t move this headquarters into enemy territory if they’re going to find it and trash the place. In an ideal world, you’ll want to do something about Tattletale’s involvement too.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking of Tattletale as an inevitable thing we’ll have to deal with,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“There are things you can do,” I said. “We can discuss those things when Natalie is gone.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Natalie said. “I should probably go. I have a class tomorrow morning and then work at the Wardens’ building tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>A class. I felt a tiny bit of resentment over the fact that she had that.</p>
<p>“Alright. Thank you for coming and saying hi,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting,” she said, forehead wrinkling in that worried way. “I really recommend you be careful.”</p>
<p>“As careful as is possible,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Natalie nodded. “It was nice to meet you all. You have my number if you need it.”</p>
<p>There was a chorus of farewells. I walked Natalie to the side door of the building, where the fire escape was. The way down was steep, and she kept one hand on her little messenger bag and the other on the railing as she made her way down, bringing one foot down to a step, then bringing the other foot down to the same step.</p>
<p>Her entire demeanor made me feel faintly anxious. I didn’t have a great read on her yet, she’d spent ten minutes at the temporary headquarters here, and most of it had been spent observing.</p>
<p>It was something of a relief to have her available if we needed her, and it was a different kind of relief to have her gone. The others, too, seemed to relax a bit.</p>
<p>“Natalie seemed nice enough,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“She did,” I said.</p>
<p>I took a moment to get Natalie’s number off my phone and put it on one corner of the whiteboard I’d been using, the whiteboard leaning against the wall. I then wrote down Gilpatrick’s, with a note beneath it. For emergencies only.</p>
<p>The Patrol was a resource, Gilpatrick was one too. I didn’t want to overuse that card, though. Gilpatrick had already been too kind with being a reference for me while I hunted for work.</p>
<p>With those numbers in the top corner, joined by my own, I wrote down ‘Hurdles’.</p>
<p>We’d already covered the basics of the major players on the scene. Speedrunners, Birdbrain, Braindead, Bitter Pill. There were others that we’d learn about, I was sure. Prancer was the closest thing we had to a kingpin that needed toppling.</p>
<p>In a hypothetical world where everything went <em>perfectly</em>, I wouldn’t have minded getting Tattletale as a part of things. I wasn’t sure my hopes were that high.</p>
<p>I put them down as the people the group needed to knock down before they could fully set up.</p>
<p>I wrote down ‘Team: Needs name &amp; brand.’</p>
<p>“Ooh,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>She was watching me write stuff down, her attention no longer on her computers.</p>
<p>“Here,” Tristan said, approaching my whiteboard. He held it up, and then created the orange sparks. They solidified, becoming the legs that raised the whiteboard up to a convenient level.</p>
<p>“There’s no rush to name ourselves,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“No rush,” I said. “But it needs doing. It’ll be easier to interact with other heroes once you have something. Are you taking a cape name?”</p>
<p>“Probably,” she said. “I’m not sure I want to go the doll route. A little too similar to Mannequin. A lot of the reaching, grabbing names are already taken.”</p>
<p>“Brainstorm, think about it, see what feels comfortable,” I said. “Kenzie and Tristan, you guys too. You probably can’t use your old cape names.”</p>
<p>“I was Optics,” Kenzie said. “I can’t use my old name, I don’t think. PRT owned it.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” I said.</p>
<p>“I think I can use Capricorn,” Tristan said. “When we reached out to the first Capricorn for permission, they signed over the rights to Byron and me, not to Reach.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Ninety-nine percent sure.”</p>
<p>“That simplifies things,” I said.</p>
<p>“Observer, Pupil, Scrutinizer,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Those are terrible,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Um. Watcher. Eyewitness, Gape?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” Chris said. “Gape. That doesn’t have connotations at all.”</p>
<p>“Beholder?” Kenzie asked, her eye on her computer screen. “Spectator. Specs. Voyeur?”</p>
<p>“Voyeur. Perfect,” Chris said, filling his voice with sarcasm. “Little Kenzie watching through the window while you change. We could make that a thing.”</p>
<p>“What kind of thing?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“You could be Groper,” Chris said. “Sveta could be Hentai or Tentacle Love or something.”</p>
<p>“Ew,” Sveta said. “And lame to go there.”</p>
<p>Chris smiled, seemingly not bothered that he’d bothered Sveta. “I could be…”</p>
<p>“Short and curly?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>There were a few chuckles.</p>
<p>“And Victoria, she needs a name and she’s sort of a member of the team,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m shocked, just shocked, at how Chris finally starts participating more when the rude stuff comes up,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Kenzie said. “That seems like it’s one hundred percent Chris.”</p>
<p>I smiled. Chris had given me an in, and if I was going to get along with these guys, I needed to put something out there. “If you want to give me a vaguely rude name, tie it to my attention-grabbing aura, me being hard to crack when my defenses are up?”</p>
<p>“You have an idea?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Pearl,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s… really subtle,” he said. “Kind of wimpy.”</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I like it because Kenzie doesn’t get it, so I don’t feel weird saying it around her,” I said.</p>
<p>“That’s a good line of thinking,” Sveta said. “I approve.”</p>
<p>She’d stuck out her fist, and I stuck out mine to meet it. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I actually agree with Chris,” Kenzie said. She’d turned around and was looking something up online. “Pearl is pretty lame as innuendo goes.”</p>
<p>“But it works,” I said. “It fits. That has to count for something.”</p>
<p>There was a throat-clearing noise, interrupting the back-and-forth. All heads turned toward Tristan.</p>
<p>“I think I have all of you beat,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Of course you do,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Even if you didn’t have us beat, you’d say you had us beat,” Chris said. “And then you’d ruin the joke by insisting you win even when yours is lame.”</p>
<p>“I’m one hundred percent positive I win,” Tristan said. “I have the best rude name. Guarantee you.”</p>
<p>“One hundred percent is pretty confident,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’m one hundred and ten percent confident, even,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Out with it, then,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Tristan straightened, fixed his armor at the front, and cleared his throat, drawing it out.</p>
<p>“You’re setting us up for disappointment,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Tristan cleared his throat again, exaggerated, until everyone from Sveta to Chris was rolling their eyes.</p>
<p>“Wet and Horny Teens,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>It said something that nobody wanted to give him a laugh at that. It was Chris who cracked first, falling out of his seat before the impact let the initial guffaw loose. I chuckled, half at Tristan, and half at how much Chris seemed to be enjoying this.</p>
<p>“That’s atrocious,” Sveta said, but she was smiling.</p>
<p>“Tristan is pretty atrocious, so it makes a lot of sense coming from him,” Rain said. “It says a lot that that’s his idea of subtle.”</p>
<p>“It’s subtle like a brick through a window,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Come on,” Tristan said. “You guys give me <em>so</em> much shit, you don’t give me any credit. I deserve a win for this one. It’s <em>great</em>.”</p>
<p>Chris was on the floor still, pounding one fist on the floorboards while holding in his laughs.</p>
<p>I looked over at Kenzie, who had her back to the group, her face in her hands as she held in her laughs.</p>
<p>Immature, stupid, but so valuable to have the little bonding moment. I had a smile on my face as I returned to the whiteboard.</p>
<p>My eye returned to the people the group needed to take down, the ones who were in the way, or who were set up in such a way as to make the covert information gathering fail from the get-go.</p>
<p>I wrote down ‘Rain’s situation’.</p>
<p>He needed protection. I added the three members of his cluster, and then drew an arrow, looping back to Tattletale.</p>
<p>The smile dropped away from my face as I stared at her name. It kept going back to her. She was a massive obstacle.</p>
<p>Sveta came to stand next to me, looking at my whiteboard. “Distract me from these perverts.”</p>
<p>I stuck out my marker, putting a dot beside Tattletale’s name.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a bit of a grudge,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a lot of a grudge,” I said. “A lot of things would be simpler if we could do something about her. I’m thinking…”</p>
<p>“You have an idea?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. I turned around. “I have an idea. I don’t suppose you have any contacts or favors you can pull in? With capes, specifically?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Sveta said. “Weld, and Weld’s friends. I’m kind of reluctant to go there though.”</p>
<p>I nodded. It made sense that she was reluctant. Sveta wanted to stand on her own. Going that route would be the opposite of what she wanted.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Friends, contacts,” Sveta said. “Capes we could reach out to. Victoria has an idea.”</p>
<p>“I do,” Kenzie said, perking up some as she caught wind of our conversation. “Or I might. I can try. What’s this for?”</p>
<p>“Making a first move, in a way that won’t give the lawyer headaches,” I said. “It’s not going to make us any friends though.”</p>
<p>“Seems to be an emerging pattern, that,” Rain said.</p>
<p><em>If we aren’t in a position to behead the snake, maybe we can de-fang it.</em></p>

</div> <h1 id="chap35">Shade &mdash; 4.2</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“Classify the following angles as obtuse, acute, or right,” Kenzie said. She sighed.</p>
<p>“You know this?” I asked.</p>
<p>She looked up from her homework and rolled her eyes. “Yes, I know this. I didn’t have the words to describe what I knew before taking the class but I get this.”</p>
<p>“Make it interesting,” I said. “Challenge yourself, try to answer as fast as you can, and try to get past where you’re having to think about it and get to where the knowledge is automatic.”</p>
<p>“Acute, acute, obtuse, right, acute, obtuse, acute, right, right,” she said. “I’m really tempted to sit down and make up my own questions to leave on the worksheet for the teacher, except I’d have to look things up to make sure some mathematician didn’t already give it a name. What’s it called when it’s a full circle? Three hundred and sixty degrees of angle?”</p>
<p>I frowned. “You’re asking me to think back about seven years right now. Complete, I think?”</p>
<p>“Full, complete, or perigon,” Chris said.</p>
<p>All heads craned around to look at him. He was sitting in a corner, a table to his left, with so many things piled up that the bag, costume, snacks and notebooks loomed well over the top of his head. He sat on a chair with his feet up on the seat, a comic and phone on his lap. He had his headphones on, but only one was covering an ear.</p>
<p>He realized people were looking and frowned. “What?”</p>
<p>“You actually have a brain?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I studied it a few weeks ago,” Chris said, shrugging, turning his attention back to his comic.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I don’t remember studying that when I was your age,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I self-study. There aren’t enough seats in schools so they gave us the option of doing these workbooks and handing them in. I’ve lost track of how far ahead I got,” Chris said. “It’s why I don’t have homework. My regular schoolwork is the homework and I get that done earlier in the day.”</p>
<p>“Perigon,” Kenzie said to herself, hunched over her worksheet and books, a pen in hand. “That one sounds best. Let’s call this one a… hyper-perigon angle.”</p>
<p>“More complete an angle than a circle?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said. “If you want to get into multidimensional space then you have to get there somehow. So you make a circle that’s more closed than a regular circle and that gives you an in, right? It can be theoretical if you want but obviously this is one of a hundred ways I can start pushing the boundaries.”</p>
<p>“Uh huh.”</p>
<p>She drew on the paper with her pen, drawing out a perfect circle and then scribbling out extra lines and numbers.</p>
<p>“You’re aware you can’t hand that in now, right?” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it’s fine,” Kenzie said. “Once you’re there you can start thinking about lenses positioned to use the excess space you’ve given yourself and play that out. I heard somewhere that images that hit the back of your eye get flipped upside-down, and the brain turns it back upright. So we write something down that lets us toy with that concept…”</p>
<p>Her pen moved as she wrote out a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>“…And from there we get the reflected extra space on the other side of the lens constant. In brief, we start talking about <em>hyper</em>-hyper-perigon angles.”</p>
<p>“Hyper is right,” Chris muttered.</p>
<p>“Shh, leave her alone,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Kenzie looked up at me, “This is where I have to leave you behind, Victoria, because I get stuff that’s hyper-hyper but I can’t help you get it.”</p>
<p>“Frankly, you left me behind a minute ago,” I said. “What are the hearts, stars, and apples you’re writing down?”</p>
<p>“It’s algebra, duh. You don’t have to use X and Y or A and B. You can use anything to represent the variable. I like hearts and stars and apples.”</p>
<p>“I feel like if you autopsied Kenzie, she’d have a bowl of breakfast cereal instead of gray matter.”</p>
<p>Kenzie spun around, sticking out a hand to grab the desk so she didn’t keep spinning. She stared at Chris, “I feel like if we autopsied <em>you</em>, Chris, we’d find you have one of those tumors with teeth, eyes and hair in it instead of a brain.”</p>
<p>“There’s a good chance you actually would,” Chris said. “That’d be cool.”</p>
<p>“Yes it would,” Kenzie said, very seriously. She spun herself around, grabbing the desk, now facing her defaced homework.</p>
<p>Sveta walked over from the whiteboard, where she’d finished tracing the faces that had once been projected onto it. An artist’s sketch of the players we’d seen and been involved with. Another part of the whiteboard had some name ideas.</p>
<p>“You can’t hand that in,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I said that already,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie looked up at me. “People often ask how the tinkering stuff works. It’s real easy. All it takes is closing a circle extra closed and having the right lens to use the wrinkles and bulges that result.”</p>
<p>“Easy,” I said, smiling a little.</p>
<p>She continued drawing out math and lines. She had a steady hand when it came to drawing out the geometry. I idly wondered if her tinker power played into that. She began drawing out a gun, similar to her flash pistol.</p>
<p>The drawing of a woman’s face was comparatively, almost ludicrously crude compared to the gun she’d drawn out. Kenzie scribbled out the eyes, then wrote out ‘I gave boring angle homework and now I’m blind foreverrrr’.</p>
<p>She wrote out a few more ‘r’s and then paused, scribbling out ‘boring’ and writing ‘obtuse’ above the scribble.</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Sveta said, with a truly impressive amount of disappointment in the one word.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned her head slightly, looking up at Sveta with one eye that twinkled with mischief. She looked back at her work, writing down an extra ‘oh no’ by the teacher’s head.</p>
<p>I cocked my head, listening as Kenzie worked with renewed energy.</p>
<p>“You’re getting carried away,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I looked at the boxes near Kenzie, saw the projector box to Kenzie’s right had a face lit up. It was pointed at the whiteboard Sveta had been working on, but no longer projected the camera images of the faces.</p>
<p>Reaching down, I plucked the pen from Kenzie’s hand.</p>
<p>She didn’t protest or stop me, only leaning back as I picked up the paper.</p>
<p>I walked a few paces away, holding up the sheet, glanced back at the projector box, and then walked another two paces.</p>
<p>The projected image of the scribblings, tinker notes and doodles disappeared. I turned it around to show Sveta.</p>
<p>She took the sheet, then experimented with moving it inside and beyond the boundaries of the projector box. Kenzie perched on the edge of her seat, watching, her tongue sticking out between her teeth, where she lightly bit it.</p>
<p>“Well played,” I said.</p>
<p>“I said it was fine,” she said.</p>
<p>“You did.”</p>
<p>“She filled in some of the right answers with real pen marks while scribbling,” Sveta observed. She turned the sheet around, moving it through the air.</p>
<p>The scratched out word with ‘obtuse’ over it had been cover for putting ‘obtuse’ into one of the blanks.</p>
<p>“Very well played,” I said.</p>
<p>Sveta handed the sheet back. Kenzie put it down and moved her hand. The projector moved the image of the scribblings on her whiteboard, leaving the sheet normal. She flipped it over and sighed, head lolling back. Without looking at the sheet, she said, “Acute, right, obtuse, acute, acute, obtuse.”</p>
<p>Sveta approached, putting a hand on Kenzie’s head. “How about instead of doing the math homework you could do in your sleep, you take advantage of having us here to help you with stuff you aren’t as strong with? What do you struggle with?”</p>
<p>“I get As in everything and A pluses in some stuff. But I work on English for the longest and I’m a little less good at gym. Mostly when I get bad marks it’s because I lost marks because my teachers are fed up with me.”</p>
<p>“Fed up?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Beyer docked my grade because I wanted to stay inside at recess to talk with her about a project and she said I couldn’t and she needed a break from me. She said no ifs ands or buts and I said but, so she penalized my grade. Then when I tried to argue she took off a mark for every word I said. Five marks for five words, and one for the but&mdash; don’t even say it, Chris.”</p>
<p>Chris was talking with Tristan and Rain. “You’re so self-important you think I’m listening to you?”</p>
<p>Kenzie smiled, rolling her eyes a bit.</p>
<p>“English, then?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“It takes me the longest,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Sveta looked at me. “How were you in English?”</p>
<p>“B minus or thereabouts,” I said. “I did better with the courses I took at the hospital than I did in high school.”</p>
<p>“How come?”</p>
<p>“I write good papers and I’m good with themes and symbolism, but the classes I took in high school spent so long on each thing I felt like my brain was turning inside out with boredom. I’d start resenting the books and I sabotaged myself by not doing the related work or reading it myself. Don’t do that, Kenzie.”</p>
<p>“I do well in English, even with the parts we sit on forever,” Sveta said. “I’ll take point in helping Kenzie, you help?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” I said.</p>
<p>My role ended up being even more backseat than that. Sveta had read the book, and I hadn’t. I stood back, watching, glanced back at the others, where the three boys were talking video games, which they had been doing since before Kenzie had started on her homework, and I rolled my eyes.</p>
<p>Rain stepped away from the conversation. Grabbing a marker from the packet, he wrote ‘Rain’ at the top corner of his whiteboard.</p>
<p>Below that, he wrote, ‘names’, followed by ‘Bracer’, ‘Clasp’, and ‘Pinch’.</p>
<p>I approached, looking.</p>
<p>“No homework?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I like to do it late. My family mostly leaves me alone while I’m doing it, and I get to tire out my brain and distract myself from what sleeping actually involves. I can go straight from that to bed.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Sounds like you have a system then. If you ever need help with studying, I’m happy to help.”</p>
<p>“I’m a pretty crummy student, but I get by. I think I’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I can’t see myself doing anything that leans too heavily on the school thing anyway.”</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised at how it comes into play,” I said.</p>
<p>“Maybe. But… I dunno if I see myself being alive and well a few years from now. That might be some of it.”</p>
<p>“Because of your cluster?”</p>
<p>“Because capes don’t tend to live that long. Because things were going south well before Gold Morning and it doesn’t feel like anything’s over or stopped. Every day, I think about the fact that there are still Endbringers out there. Broken triggers. Dangerous people with too much power.”</p>
<p>“There’s heroes. People stopping those things. Maybe you’ll be one of them. People die&mdash; it sucks but not all of them die. Not all of us.”</p>
<p>“I guess,” he said. “It might sound like I’m trying to ask for a pep talk, but I’m really not. Right now, I’m focused on things I gotta do. Like a name.”</p>
<p>That was my signal to back off. Fine.</p>
<p>“Clasp is a fairly decent name. Could work with the right costume. I’m not sure it feels right with the blaster power.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of seizing something, as a prelude to something, or unclasping as… it sounded better in my head. Don’t laugh at my terrible names or reasoning, please,” he said. “Making a name that captures all of your powers when you have four is a pain in the ass. I’m just brainstorming.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to make fun,” I said. “I have no idea what I’m going to call myself when I get back to the costumed heroics.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he said. “I was trying to think of names that might sound like they refer to the hands and the set-up, knock-down part of the power. Kind of. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Bracer’s taken, by the way,” I said. “I’m not sure of the others.”</p>
<p>He reached down to the pile of stuff at the foot of his board and picked up one of his tinker arms. It was just a bit thinner than his regular arm, just a bit shorter. Kenzie’s picture of a gun had looked more ‘tinker’ than this. It was wires with sheet metal bent into a crude, hand-like shape around it. He brought the textured plastic pad up to his shoulder and bound the straps around his shoulder, armpit, and upper arm before tapping it twice. He winced, showing his teeth momentarily.</p>
<p>“Hurts?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nervous connection, and a bit of excess energy with the switch-on. I could fine tune it so it doesn’t shock me, but I might break something in the process. Ashley’s hands are made by someone who doesn’t even focus on prosthetics and they’re better than what I make.”</p>
<p>“You might be better than you think.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Yamada thinks I have self esteem problems, but I <em>do</em> suck, so it’s more like I’m too aware of my reality. My blaster power is <em>okay</em>, because it’s mine, but it’s kind of all or nothing, leaning just a bit toward nothing, especially if I’m avoiding trying to kill, which I am.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. I thought of him jumping off the train. I wondered how honest he was about it. “The mover power, it lets you…”</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>He stepped back, then jogged a few steps, stopping mid-run, as if he’d frozen in time. He hadn’t, though. While suspended at an angle someone else would have tipped over, he twisted around and put a foot out to one side. He moved in another direction, back to his board.</p>
<p>“Any limitations? If I used my full strength and threw you, would you only slow down?”</p>
<p>“No. I’d stop. If I timed it right, I could fall from a plane, hit terminal velocity and then stop myself just before hitting the ground. It’s&mdash; it’d be useful then, it’s useful if I want to not fall over or if I want to maneuver a bit. But it’s not that amazing as powers go.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t lying, then. Not about that. There were uses, but it did sound somewhat limited for even a secondary power.</p>
<p>He seemed to read something in my expression, because he had further protests, “It’s <em>really</em> not that amazing. I have to wait between each use of it, and it’s not something I can build a name or identity around. The emotion power has no impact or visual side to it, so it’s out too.”</p>
<p>“A few of the multi-triggers I’m aware of tend to have more… I’m not sure what the word is. Esoteric or abstract names. The one villain in my town was Circus. The solution to a disparate set of powers is to just create something more out there that has its own identity, and then fit your powers to match, instead of trying to fit your identity to a random set of powers.”</p>
<p>“Identity like what?”</p>
<p>“Like… if you’re standing back and using your blaster power, maybe something like a warlock aesthetic. You could have a robe, multiple arms, you’ve got your ‘magic’, both with the blaster power and the emotion one.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, quieter than before. He stared at the board. “Not like that. That’s not me and I don’t want to go there.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. I folded my arms, looking at the names he’d put down. “If you like video games… is there an aesthetic or character or kind of game you could tap into?”</p>
<p>“I’d be worried about choosing something I get tired of a month from now.”</p>
<p>“Just…” I started, trying to think of a good argument. “Just as a starting point, to get you thinking.”</p>
<p>“The space opera game I got from Chris, one of the things he gave me to keep me sane when I’m out in the middle of nowhere and I don’t want to bother Erin. Chris, what’s the Void class I played, the worker one?”</p>
<p>“There are three. Miner, welder, and rigger. You played either of the last two.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded to himself, then looked at the board.</p>
<p>He started to write something down. He got as far as Rig when I said, “Rigger and Rig are taken.”</p>
<p>Rain threw down the marker and he clenched both his tinker and regular hands into fists. “Son of a…”</p>
<p>“Sorry to be the bearer of bad news,” I said.</p>
<p>“What does it matter?” Tristan asked. He was still hanging with Chris at the one end of the room. “Names are taken, so what? It’s not like there’s a system out there enforcing that stuff. Kenzie could call herself Optics, it’s not like there’s a PRT.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to though,” Kenzie said. “It gets complicated.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but for the sake of argument,” Tristan said. “Why couldn’t she if she wanted to?”</p>
<p>“Rigger or Rig could still be alive,” I said. “And we don’t know what’s going to happen in the future with people picking up where the PRT left off. Finding a good name and identity you’re comfortable with is hard, and capes tend to be protective of their names as a result. Mix-ups and headaches used to be common and we don’t want to go there. People travel to your town to literally fight you over a name.”</p>
<p>“I’m still not sold on the PRT issue,” Tristan said. “They’re gone. They aren’t coming back.”</p>
<p>“The remnants of them are. Organizations using their files and methods. A military-esque group following the rules and regulations of the PRT’s code of justice. There are headaches involved.”</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. Sveta started toward it, but Kenzie leaped out of her chair and beat her to it, opening the door.</p>
<p>Kenzie saluted as Ashley entered. Ashley had a plastic bag with books and her dress in it. She moved those things out of the way, holding them while Kenzie fished the two camera drones out of the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>“Good work,” Tristan said. “Lawyer-person left some tips, but I liked a lot about how you handled that.”</p>
<p>“It was very natural,” I said. “You’ll probably like the headaches you gave them, putting them on the spot like you did. Kenzie got some of their conversation after.”</p>
<p>Ashley smiled.</p>
<p>“How was the train ride?” Sveta asked. “You might have to go back and forth a bit, I hope it isn’t too boring.”</p>
<p>“It was fine. I read a book. A baby cried after looking at me and I was amused.”</p>
<p>“A baby cried?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I look intimidating, apparently.”</p>
<p>“Or it cried because it’s a baby,” Chris said. “Babies cry about everything. They’re stupid like that.”</p>
<p>“It cried because of me,” Ashley said. “I’ve made enough people cry to know when it’s because of me.”</p>
<p>Chris shrugged. “I’ll defer to the expert.”</p>
<p>“It could be because you’re different,” Kenzie said. “The first house I was in growing up, there were mostly only black people in my neighborhood, and I remember my aunt had a baby and the baby cried whenever he saw a white person. It might be like that. Except you’ve got the cool eyes and hair.”</p>
<p>“On that topic,” Ashley said. “Eye. Mine’s bothering me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sure, I’ll get it,” Kenzie said. She ran to her desk, then ran back to Ashley, who bent down, one hand on Kenzie’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Sticking a pair of tweezers into Ashley’s eye, Kenzie grabbed and withdrew the camera. It had a flat head like a nail, but the camera’s body more closely resembled a pin in how thin and long it was, with wires encircling its length in a double-helix.</p>
<p>I winced a little, watching it come out. Ashley didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand that,” Sveta said. “Maybe it’s because eyes are one of the only things I have, but eeesh.”</p>
<p>She rattled a bit as she shuddered or mimed a shudder.</p>
<p>“It’s phased out, you wimps,” Kenzie said. “It’s not actually stabbing anything. It treats the eye as a portal and a model and unfolds in non-space using that framework.”</p>
<p>“I felt it moving around,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>mostly</em> not actually stabbing anything,” Kenzie corrected her statement. “One to three percent in reality at most, stabbing at things. Sorry. I’ll fine tune the phase. It might be responding to your power.”</p>
<p>“I have regular appointments with someone who can give me a replacement if you destroy my eye,” Ashley said. “I’m not worried. I trust you.”</p>
<p>“Awesome,” Kenzie said, wiping the camera-pin with a tissue.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure it was ‘awesome’. I knew who that person was. Bonesaw.</p>
<p>“We watched what we could before you left and the flying cameras ran out of battery,” I said. “Then we talked about plans and did some homework.”</p>
<p>“Thinking about names,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Rude jokes about names too,” Chris said. “Tristan had a good one.”</p>
<p>“Glad I missed that,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“You have a board, just so you know,” Kenzie said. “You can make notes.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Ashley said. “What plans were you talking about?”</p>
<p>“We wanted to wait until you were here to do anything,” I said. “Tattletale’s a persistent issue. She’s lurking in the background, and she’s hard to shake. Instead of having her looming, it might be nice to rattle her a bit. It might be possible to do it in a way that doesn’t tip her off about who you guys are or how you’re operating.”</p>
<p>“How?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>I explained, “Kenzie can call her old teammates. We’ll offer an exchange. A favor for a favor. We know that the people in Cedar Point are easily spooked. This is new, untested ground, and thanks to you, we know that Prancer is the closest thing they have to a boss and he’s inexperienced. We can put them on the back foot.”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you the transcript and a recording so you can check it out on your own time,” Kenzie told Ashley.</p>
<p>“Back foot?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“They’re easily spooked and Tattletale gave them free questions they can ask. They’ve used some already, and they might have used them all,” I said. “So… we leverage hero groups and some secondary people. They do a one-loop patrol or light investigation, show their faces.”</p>
<p>“Pressure,” Tristan said. “Part of why you patrol in the first place, but we’re using other people.”</p>
<p>“We can apply pressure on our own,” Ashley said. “We have me, and we have Chris.”</p>
<p>“The law student said you should back off a bit,” Sveta said. “You did a good job of being intimidating and believable. It would be better if we stirred the pot some, let them focus on other things, heat dies down. There’s less of a chance they’ll investigate you if they’re focused on heroes.”</p>
<p>I jumped in, “Seeing how you were in Prancer’s face, I think it might be better to have you keep doing that, than to have you inexplicably be nicer or calmer. We just drop you back into Cedar Point when they’ve already got their hands full, you get to make them miserable and blindside them. They might even turn to you for help.”</p>
<p>“And that gives us power,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“And we have a trump card,” Tristan said. “The recording of the conversation with Tattletale. That’s endgame stuff, but if it turns out she’s digging and she’s on our trail anyway, we can use it to mess with her. We can give them the impression she wanted us to pressure them so they’d use questions and keep buying her services.”</p>
<p>Ashley smiled.</p>
<p>Hm. Maybe not the <em>best</em> thing if Ashley was that pleased with my idea.</p>
<p>I decided I had her on board and I had her playing nice. Time to sell her on the more cautious, moderated part of things. “We play this slow, but we can maintain power, we can put them on the back foot, and we have a way of screwing up one of the major players on the bad guy’s side. That last one is the kind of thing we’ll want to consult outside parties for. Tip off the Wardens or one of the big teams that we’re messing with Tattletale, in case they want that to coincide with something else they’ve got going on.”</p>
<p>“More people involved is more chances a spy gives up the wrong info,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Very true,” I said. “That’s where it’s good to make it so we’re only calling people we know and trust. Former teammates. I think we can reasonably assume the likes of Chevalier are fairly legit. Others, we control the information we give them. We do this smart.”</p>
<p>“I like it,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I can call my old teammates,” Kenzie said, collapsing back into her computer chair. She put the eyeball-pin camera into a jewelry box. “I don’t know if they’ll say yes, but I can try.”</p>
<p>“If everything else falls through, I can call Weld and ask if he knows people,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“There are options,” I said. “I met some people at the community center. They might help me out.”</p>
<p>“I know people too,” Ashley said. “From my appointments. I can try asking when I next run into them.”</p>
<p>“You’re sure? You actually have hero friends?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“No. But they’re heroes other people trust to work with someone like me, we talk, and I can exchange favors with them.”</p>
<p>“That’s awesome,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I’ll call mine, first?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>The others agreed. Chris was still in the corner with his phone and comic, and Tristan walked over to grab him, wheeling him to the center of the room so he’d participate. Chris did crack a smile at that.</p>
<p>“Still feeling that hit of joy from the other day?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Indulgence, not joy. I’m indulging myself or other people if I smile.”</p>
<p>“Shhhh!” Kenzie shushed people. “I’m on the phone.”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“Hi, Houndstooth,” she said.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“I found it online.”</p>
<p>Pause. Sveta used the break in Kenzie speaking to shoot me a worried look.</p>
<p>“It’s technically online. It didn’t take much to figure it out.”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want to bother you. I’m part of a different team now and we’re doing our thing. Yeah. We’re calling people we know and trust and exchanging favors for favors, and I thought I’d ask you, since you seemed like you might be interested based on how the last conversation went.”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“I thought it went okay,” Kenzie said, smiling and rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Really. I’m not&mdash;”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said. She pulled the phone away from her ear. “Houndstooth wants to talk to the person in charge of the group.”</p>
<p>I saw Ashley and Tristan exchange looks.</p>
<p>“I hate phones,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>Tristan reached for the phone.</p>
<p>“Houndstooth. I’m Capricorn. Yeah. Team Reach. Group of six with a coach that’s a partial member, kind of.”</p>
<p>He glanced at me as he said it, and I shrugged.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s here. We’ve got a thing going on, we were thinking of cooperating with other groups. Can I put you on speaker?”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned around, and hit a key on her keyboard.</p>
<p>An image appeared in the center of our group, and most of us backed away.</p>
<p>A still image of a person. He had a sleek, Anubis-like helmet or mask that encapsulated his head. His actual outfit was sleek as well, but Western. Nothing of an actual houndstooth pattern, ironically.</p>
<p>“You’re on speaker, I think,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Hi guys,” Houndstooth said. He sounded more adult than ‘kid’. “I’ve got to admit, I’m wary.”</p>
<p>“Understandable. I get that this comes out of nowhere,” Tristan said. “Listen, this is a take-it-or-leave-it thing, we’re fine if you decide it’s too much of a question mark and pass. Offer is a favor for a favor. There’s an area we’re interested in, and we’re hoping to get some other people showing up there, patrols. Maximizing pressure and seeing what we can shake up.”</p>
<p>“What area?”</p>
<p>“Can’t say until you agree, but it’s not too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I can think of a few places it could be, especially if you’re a new team operating in open jurisdictions. New Brockton, or one of the Fallen camps, big or small.”</p>
<p>Kenzie wrote something down. She held up the paper.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>he’s smart</em></p>
<p>“Less dangerous than that, even,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We show up, we… patrol, make our presences known. What’s the fallout?”</p>
<p>“Twenty percent chance they pick a fight?” Tristan asked. He looked around at the group.</p>
<p>“Ten at most, and only if you stick around. I visited and they took half an hour before showing their faces,” Ashley said. “They won’t go for the jugular, either. Worst case is they bruise your pride.”</p>
<p>“I’m feeling more like this is one of those places the B-listers are moving to, now.”</p>
<p>“No comment,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Houndstooth said. “And we can call in a favor in exchange? What sort? You patrol somewhere or help us pull off a complicated arrest?”</p>
<p>Kenzie pointed to herself.</p>
<p>“We’ve got Optics, who’s not calling herself Optics anymore, for one thing,” Sveta spoke up.</p>
<p>“You’re lucky,” Houndstooth said. Kenzie sat up straighter.</p>
<p>“…but I’m thinking in other directions.” Houndstooth finished. Kenzie slouched in her seat.</p>
<p>“What kind of directions?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking. Capricorn, can I hold onto this favor without naming it?”</p>
<p>Tristan looked around. There were a few nods. Tristan said, “Sure. That was my original take on how this would go. The others seem cool with that. I’ll give you my phone number.”</p>
<p>Tristan gave his number. There was a break while Houndstooth took it down.</p>
<p>“If you’re game, I think we can let you know where we’re thinking of,” I said. The others nodded, so I added, “Cedar Point. Hollow Point in villain vernacular.”</p>
<p>“You know,” Houndstooth said. “It bothered me that it wasn’t being looked after.”</p>
<p>“That was my feeling too,” I said.</p>
<p>“Who’s speaking, can I ask?”</p>
<p>“Victoria Dallon. I used to be Glory Girl, and I’m the coach, so to speak.”</p>
<p>“I know the name. Hi. You’re wanting to rattle these guys?”</p>
<p>“That’s the basic idea,” I said.</p>
<p>“Basic idea? Even before you said that, I had the impression there was a less basic part to the idea. Am I right about there being more to this?”</p>
<p>“Some. Nothing that impacts you negatively,” I said.</p>
<p>Tristan spoke up, “We’re hoping to tap some others, maintain pressure, and hold off on getting personally involved until we know how much reach these guys really have.”</p>
<p>“They’re bit players. This thing happens now and again. It tends to self-combust.”</p>
<p>Tristan looked at me.</p>
<p>Passing the ball to me? I said, “We know how much reach they probably have, and there’s some.”</p>
<p>“Interesting.”</p>
<p>I went on, “Personally speaking, I don’t want this to combust. Some skirmishes are probably inevitable, but these guys aren’t, as was said earlier, going to go for the jugular. I want to keep it limited to that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see any places combusting either. If you think it’s safe and if you want to help save Cedar Point, I think I can sell my team on a patrol or two.”</p>
<p>“That’d be great,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“If something happens and we get in over our heads, you back us up or call the bigger names?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Tristan said. “Probably the latter. We’ve got kids and stuff, and we’ve been urged on multiple fronts to keep on the down-low.”</p>
<p>Ashley looked annoyed at that.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Houndstooth said. “Hm. I know another team that might be okay doing something similar, if you’re wanting to get others on board. I can put you in touch with them, but I’d want a minor favor. One I already have in mind.”</p>
<p>“If they’re trustworthy and won’t spill our role in things or why people are showing interest in Cedar Point. What’s the favor?”</p>
<p>“They are trustworthy. Before I commit my team, I want to meet you guys face to face. Grab a coffee or something. Glory Girl and Capricorn and whoever else is in a leadership position.”</p>
<p>Kenzie sunk further in her seat, so low her head couldn’t roll backward off the back of the chair. Instead, she slid to one side, her head closer to the armrest. She indicated herself, pointing, eyes rolling back so the whites showed.</p>
<p>“I think that should be fine,” Tristan said. He looked at Kenzie, and she nodded, exaggerated. “Yeah. That’s good.”</p>
<p>“Great. The team I’m thinking of is Auzure. Corporate.”</p>
<p>“I know them,” I said. “I’m not sure they’re my top choice.”</p>
<p>“I don’t recommend them lightly,” Houndstooth said. “They’re by-the-book, serious, they’re strong for a small team, they stick to their word, and they’re looking for opportunities to get out there.”</p>
<p>“That last bit is what concerns me,” I said. “They’re looking for exposure and this team wants more subtlety. We want the villains in Cedar Point wondering why heroes are there and tapping their resources.”</p>
<p>“And you get to see what resources they have.”</p>
<p>“Basically,” I said.</p>
<p>“You keep using that word and I keep realizing you’ve really got a plan. Okay. I think I like this. Auzure is out, then? That’s your gut feeling?”</p>
<p>“Can I put you on mute while I confer?” I asked. “I’m just the coach, I don’t want to make decisions.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>Kenzie sat up and hit a key on her keyboard. A red ‘x’ appeared over the mouth and ears of the hologram image of Houndstooth.</p>
<p>Really weird that she had that, I noted.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I interviewed for Auzure. They were just a bit sleazy. Greedy. Their reason for interviewing me was to get at my family, just as one example of a red flag that came up. My feeling is if you guys bring them in, they’ll try to do something flashy or get more involved than you want them.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I’d rather avoid them,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“They sound like the bad kind of corporate team,” Tristan said. “But I might be biased. Okay. Any thoughts? Objections?”</p>
<p>“We could use them in a limited capacity,” I said. “Have them make a phone call, instead of actually showing up.”</p>
<p>“Phone call?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Can I just see what Houndstooth says to this?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Tristan said. “Unmute.”</p>
<p>“Houndstooth,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m here.”</p>
<p>“In the interest of keeping Auzure involved in only a limited capacity, what if we had them call someone and ask about renting space? No commitment, just see if the person reports it to the villains in town. The villains would probably stress over the notion.”</p>
<p>“Stress you want. Yeah. Could work.”</p>
<p>“Ideally, we’d ask Auzure to call when Auzure is busy.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want them in your jurisdiction?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.” I said. I almost said ‘basically’.</p>
<p>“I hear you. Yeah. I think they’ve got something going on right now. Rumors of war on the horizon. Earth C. If you used them in the next week, I don’t think they’d pick up on hints.”</p>
<p>“We’d need to figure out who we want Auzure to call, so that the person called might tip off the villains. It might be tight to get that information in a week, but yeah.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got Kenzie. I think you’ll do just fine on that front.”</p>
<p>I looked at Kenzie, expecting her to perk up. She smiled, but she didn’t really show much more enthusiasm at the praise.</p>
<p>“We’ll have that face to face meeting,” Tristan said. “We can hammer out particulars then.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll call you after I’ve raised the idea with my team, and we’ll figure out a time to meet. I’ll keep quiet on it being Cedar Point until they’re on board.”</p>
<p>“Great,” Tristan said. “I’ll let you go now.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Another day, Capricorn.”</p>
<p>The phone call ended.</p>
<p>“I like him,” I said. I looked at Kenzie. “Good recommendation.”</p>
<p>“Yup,” she said. “He’s going to want to dish out all the super embarrassing dirt on me from two years ago. Uggh.”</p>
<p>“We know the dirt,” Rain said. “Most of us.”</p>
<p>“Uugh,” Kenzie groaned. “It’s like having friends over and your parents bringing out the photo album. Except way, way worse, because I wasn’t a baby when I messed up with Houndstooth around, and it’s so much worse than being in the tub or having food on my face.”</p>
<p>“We know your history, we know you’ve made great strides,” Sveta said. “I can’t speak for the others, but to me, you’re about those strides and those successes. You’re not defined by your worst days.”</p>
<p>“Uuuuuuggh,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Right?” Sveta pressed.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“It didn’t sound like that call was easy to make. If Houndstooth is on the up-and-up, then it was a really, really good recommendation,” I said.</p>
<p>“He is. He’s one of the best true-blue heroes I know,” Kenzie said, smiling a little.</p>
<p>“Two teams we can use to apply some pressure and get Cedar Point to reach out to Tattletale,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Even if they catch on, they’ll be left wondering. Heroes on your turf aren’t something you can ignore. Ignoring that makes you look weak,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>And one way or another, we would strain the relationship with this group and Tattletale, and make them less likely or able to call on her when we made our play.</p>
<p>This worked.</p>
<p>Kenzie stood from her seat, walking over to her board. She began copying down a redacted version of the scribbled-down tinker notes from before.</p>
<p>She was bothered, that much was clear. Now she was stepping away to dwell on the tinker stuff. That didn’t seem like the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p>On one wall, the one operating camera drone was showing a view of Cedar Point. Sunny, largely abandoned, and a little rough around the edges, covered in graffiti with broken things here and there from a riot or protest that hadn’t been cleaned up after.</p>
<p>The group was talking amongst themselves, about what needed to be done and arranged.</p>
<p>“Rain’s thing needs some attention,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We can talk some about that tonight, and talk more tomorrow. Offer for an escort stands, Rain.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” he said. “I don’t want to play that card yet.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie said she could do some of the surveillance from home, but we’ll probably want to meet here if we meet,” Tristan said. “Kenzie will be a regular. I can come once in a blue moon.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be here when I’m not there,” Ashley said. “If I’m holding off, then I’ll be here for the next bit.”</p>
<p>“Cool,” Kenzie said, turning. She’d added something to the board. ‘Name? Look-see / Looksee’.’</p>
<p>“I’ll be here too,” Chris said. He’d stood from his chair and was walking around Kenzie’s desk, peering at the tinker stuff. “Or around here. Sometimes I just sit around outside or find a place to read comics or watch stuff on my phone.”</p>
<p>I saw Kenzie nod to herself, glancing back over one shoulder at Chris.</p>
<p>‘Cool’, she’d said. I wasn’t sure it was. I hadn’t quite anticipated this, but with people being where they were, with the older members helping Rain, Ashley being available for surveillance, it meant Kenzie and Chris and Ashley would be spending more extended periods of time together.</p>
<p>Or, put another way, the ex-Slaughterhouse Nine member and the two ‘kids’ of the team.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop in regularly,” I said. “Keep an eye on things.”</p>
<p>“Yep,” Sveta said. “Rotate or something? With overlap, because you and I need to hang out.”</p>
<p>“Naturally,” I said, smiling. She’d picked up on the same concerns I had.</p>
<p>“A few of us here at any given time,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>There was a bit more conversation, hashing out particulars of schedule, as well as who was available on what days.</p>
<p>“I could stop in at Cedar Point. They know I was poking my head in before, but there’s no reason to let them think I’m gone and dealt with,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’ve got the hero itch,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“It’s not the hero itch,” I said. “It’s that Tattletale told me to go away and it means something if I don’t.”</p>
<p>“It’s the&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Chris!” Kenzie raised her voice.</p>
<p>Chris froze. He was leaning close to her projector box. Stuff was piled on top.</p>
<p>“Do <em>not</em> touch my bag!” she said, way louder and more intense than was necessary.</p>
<p>“Not touching a thing,” he said. “Relax.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to relax! Back off!”</p>
<p>“What, is it going to blow up or something?” he asked, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Kenzie strode forward, through the group, “Step back and leave my stuff alone!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t touch anything. Really.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Sveta said. “He didn’t touch anything.”</p>
<p>“And stop saying my stuff is going to blow up!” Kenzie said, volume still raised. She shot Chris a look and smiled. “Pretty please? It’s really not funny.”</p>
<p>“That was my fault,” I said. “I brought it up first. I’ve dealt with tinkers and hyperdimensional tech makes me nervous.”</p>
<p>“You’re fine,” Kenzie said. “You’ve been cool. I like you. I have more mixed feelings about Chris. And I have very strong feelings about things like my bag being messed with.”</p>
<p>Chris threw his hands up, retreated to the chair that Tristan had initially brought to the edge of where everyone was standing, and kicked at the ground, wheeling himself back to his corner.</p>
<p>I met Sveta’s eyes. We communicated more or less telepathically: more supervision would be needed.</p>
<p>Kenzie was now rummaging, gathering her stuff and getting it organized. She had what looked like a gym bag, white with pink piping as trim, and big plastic zipper tabs. She put stuff in it and then picked it up.</p>
<p>“Want to have a chat, Kenz?” I asked.</p>
<p>She drew in a deep breath and sighed heavily, bag held close. “Fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s not obligatory,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Yes. Chat. You’re cool. Some people aren’t.”</p>
<p>“Referring to yourself?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Not helping, Chris,” Tristan called out.</p>
<p>I led Kenzie out the side door, to the fire escape that was the access to the mostly unfurnished apartment. The air outside was far warmer than the air inside. It was late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Kenzie said. She put her bag down on one corner of the fire escape, then leaned against the railing, looking down as she wound her foot around the strap.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m really glad you’re here,” she said. “And I kind of like that you don’t know all the bad stuff.”</p>
<p>“You’re worried about what Houndstooth is going to say?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like being embarrassed,” she said. “And it’s really, really embarrassing.”</p>
<p>I didn’t like standing over her, so I walked over to where the stairs met the little platform of rusty slats and sat down sideways with my back to the exterior wall of the building. Not facing her directly, but I could comfortably look her way.</p>
<p>“I hear you,” I said. “I said it before, but I’m grateful you were willing to get closer to that territory to help everyone out. I have things I don’t like thinking about or getting into and I know what it takes to go there.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even really think about it so it’s not all that,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” I asked. “Is there anything I can do?”</p>
<p>“Talking is good,” Kenzie said, eyes on where the strap was wound around her ankle and foot. “You ever&mdash; have you ever been so humiliated that you wished the earth would open up and swallow you up?”</p>
<p>“I think everyone has. It’s part of being young, that you fumble your way through things.”</p>
<p>“Urgh,” she said. “I… I once embarrassed myself really, really badly.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And it wasn’t just one earth that split open but a multiverse of them. I was so humiliated an alien actually noticed and reached between those earths and into my head. And now I&mdash; everything’s messy and hard.”</p>
<p>“Sveta and the others seem to think you’re doing better.”</p>
<p>“I am. I’m mostly good. I backslide now and again, but I get a handle on things and I have people who help when I do.”</p>
<p>“That’s good,” I said. “That’s an achievement, especially when you’ve got an alien tied to you. You’re swimming with an anchor around your waist, and you’ve reached the shallow water. That’s incredible.”</p>
<p>Kenzie nodded. She didn’t smile.</p>
<p>“He saw me not long after everything went wrong. And then he saw me a while later when I joined his team and I wasn’t exactly great then either. Even if he saw me at my best now I don’t know if he’d be able to look past all the bad he’s seen before.”</p>
<p>“You might not be giving him enough credit,” I said.</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Kenzie said. “But I might be giving him just enough credit, and I might be really worried that this cool heroine who’s helping us out might see or hear about the bad and then she not be able to see past it, either.”</p>
<p>“The others have heard some of it, haven’t they?”</p>
<p>“From my mouth. That’s different.”</p>
<p>“They’ve heard it and they want you on their team. They respect you. Whatever happens, I don’t think Houndstooth can say anything that’s going to have more weight than what Sveta says, because Sveta’s awesome and I respect her a ton.”</p>
<p>“She’s great,” Kenzie said, staring down at her feet. “She’s the best.”</p>
<p>“And,” I said, pausing. “Whatever he says, I don’t think it should have more weight than what <em>you</em> say, either. Not when people like Sveta trust and respect you and I trust and respect her. Okay?”</p>
<p>Kenzie sniffed. A slightly runny nose, now. She wasn’t crying that I could see, but she might’ve been close.</p>
<p>“Can I give you a hug?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” She said. She stooped down and picked up her bag. She craned her head around, and looked through the window.</p>
<p>The window was opaque, the surface blurred. Kenzie’s tech, I realized.</p>
<p>“Come,” Kenzie said. Bag in her arms, she hauled the door open, and held it for me as I followed.</p>
<p>The others were watching. Sveta was on her way to the door, no doubt to let us know what was going on.</p>
<p>Two people were in the center of the camera’s focus, walking down the streets of Cedar Point.</p>
<p>I recognized one as Snag, and I could guess the other was the woman of Rain’s cluster.</p>
<p>Rain turned his head, looking at me.</p>
<p>I had an idea of what he was going to ask. He couldn’t leave this opportunity to get information alone. He couldn’t afford to.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap36">Shade &mdash; 4.3</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>It was Sveta who said it, not Rain. “If they go inside, we’re going to lose track of what they’re saying.”</p>
<p>“Have they said anything yet?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. “The woman doesn’t talk so it would be a one-sided conversation. If they’re here, they’re here for something. I want to know what.”</p>
<p>“Anything you guys do risks blowing your surveillance,” I said. “You might gain more information if you leave it alone. Just saying.”</p>
<p>“I might miss something vital,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You might,” I said. “It’s really up to you guys. If you need help, I’ll back you up.”</p>
<p>Tristan walked forward, and half-sat on the desk, head turned so he could keep one eye on the image. “Hypothetically, if we did act on this, what would we be doing? Picking a fight?”</p>
<p>“We could,” Ashley said. “Rain said they were injured and needed maintenance. It would be timely, it would keep them injured and out of the picture.”</p>
<p>“On their turf?” Tristan asked. “With who knows how many villains in the immediate area?”</p>
<p>“And it would blow our surveillance, like Victoria said,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“You’ve been quiet on why they’re after you, Rain,” Chris said. “You never talked about your trigger event.”</p>
<p>“As a rule, it’s not good to ask people about their trigger events,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“As a rule,” Chris said, “It’s vital information about who we’re fighting and why they’re doing what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>“Chris,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Sveta,” Chris said. “Detach from your emotions, focus more on <em>their</em> emotions. Are they passionate? Driven? Is it personal? If any or all of the above are true, it changes the rules of how they act. They might act even if they are injured or needing to do some maintenance.”</p>
<p>“People don’t act by rules,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Some people do,” Chris said. “Byron does, or did, based on what you said. They might. But we need more of what Rain knows about who and what they are and where they come from to know that.”</p>
<p>Kenzie turned around in her seat. “I was just telling Victoria I didn’t like the idea of her prying into my past or where I come from. It would feel pretty gross and unfair if we pushed Rain to do it now, when he obviously doesn’t want to.”</p>
<p>“Hypocritical might be the word you’re looking for,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m learning so many words today,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Putting all that aside, is there any way to listen in, if they went inside?” Rain asked. “They’re a block away from where Prancer went before. If they go there, what can we do?”</p>
<p>“I could rig something,” Kenzie said. “But it would be fragile and iffy.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help but notice we’re changing the subject,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Look. Just&mdash; I need this,” Rain said. “I’ve told Tristan everything and I’ve told Sveta some of it. If Tristan thinks it needs to be said, he can say it. He’s more objective. But I really want to know what they might say, I want to start making preparations now.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been keeping my mouth shut,” Tristan said. “I’m in a weird place, knowing what I do, not wanting to betray a friend. I feel like if I said anything at all, even if the reasons were good, it would still be betraying Rain.”</p>
<p>“I can take apart things,” Kenzie said. “Kludge it together for an emergency thing. It won’t take long but we’d need Sveta to hurry over there to plant it and that’ll take a few minutes. If that’s what we’re doing. I don’t want to break my things down if we’re not doing this, though.”</p>
<p>“I’m probably going to regret saying this, but I’ll stand up for Kenzie,” Chris said. “It’s going to be shitty if she starts taking apart good work so she can get it done in time, and then Rain doesn’t hold up his end any. That’s not fair and it’s going to lead to resentment.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about fair,” Kenzie said. “But thank you, Chris.”</p>
<p>“Don’t thank me.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to anyway. It means a lot.”</p>
<p>“No it doesn’t. I just don’t want the headaches,” Chris said. “And Rain is being the biggest headache on the team. Maybe except for me, but I don’t have anyone trying to kill me and I’m not really asking for anything, so I think I can get away with it.”</p>
<p>Rain ran his fingers through his hair, turned and took a step to one side, like he was going to walk away or pace, and then stopped, because he couldn’t take his attention off the screen.</p>
<p>Tristan was in a hard place, knowing what he did but having a friendship on the line, Sveta maybe wasn’t as much of a friend to Rain but she was also more sensitive and kind, and she didn’t know as much. Rain didn’t really have other allies in the group he could turn to. Certainly not Ashley. Not Chris. Kenzie just wanted to know if she should get started building her thing.</p>
<p>Somehow, he ended up looking at me. He looked spooked.</p>
<p>“If Kenzie builds the thing, I can fly over and plant it,” I said. “I don’t mind showing my face there, it fits with the plan, there’s a lower risk of the surveillance operation getting discovered, it works.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded, tense.</p>
<p>“But I do think Chris may be right. If the group is extending a hand to you and you’re not extending trust back, that may not be fair. You should share <em>something</em>.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Kenzie spun around. She grabbed one of her flying eyes and pried open the side, pulling out a black rectangle. She swapped it with a spare.</p>
<p>“It’s personal,” Rain said. “It’s emotional. Not helped by the dreams, by the possible personality bleed across the cluster. Some things I’ve caught lately made me think there might be some.”</p>
<p>I listened, my expression still, arms folded, mostly watching what Kenzie did while Rain talked. I was going to have to deploy this thing.</p>
<p>Kenzie popped open the jewelry case with the camera she’d put in Ashley’s eye, then tore off the section under the lens. She flicked at parts with her fingers to get them spinning and then held onto others, unscrewing them in the process.</p>
<p>“They blame me, for the events around the trigger. I’ve told Sveta all of this. The dreams are biased, selective, cherry picking from my perceptions. They make me out to be more of a bad guy than I am.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re a bad guy at all,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’m not a good guy either. And maybe that’s because of the bleed coming the other way. I feel like a completely different person than I was then. And I know &mdash; I think Snag is too. I’ve seen his perspective and his dreams, and he’s willing to murder now? Maybe the agent took half of my anger from back then and divided it among them, aiming it back at me.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“I fucked up. I had a chance to save them and I didn’t,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I looked away from where Kenzie was spinning things to screw in the eye-camera beneath the major lens of the flying eye, looked at Rain, and saw how miserable he was.</p>
<p>“How does Erin fit in?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t. She knows the story but she hasn’t seen the dreams. I think if she saw the dreams like the three members of the cluster did, she’d hate me too. But she doesn’t.”</p>
<p>“And ‘of 5?'” Chris asked.</p>
<p>I turned my head.</p>
<p>“My username, online,” Rain explained. “I don’t know what happened to the fifth. It’s complicated. I can think of a few people it might be. People that didn’t make it.”</p>
<p>Kenzie turned around. The camera looked worse for wear. I realized it was the nice one, with the adaptive camouflage or whatever it was. Panels were missing and wires exposed. She beckoned me to approach. I did.</p>
<p>“Put the lens side against the wall or the roof. There’s a plunger on the side here, you see?”</p>
<p>In a groove along the side, normally meant to aid in aerodynamics or something, the metal rod ran flush with the body.</p>
<p>“I see,” I said. I looked at the screen. They’d walked past the place where Prancer had gone inside.</p>
<p>“Put it up against the surface, then slowly, <em>super slowly</em> push that in. There’s no resistance built in, so you could push it in in half a second if you weren’t careful.”</p>
<p>“What would happen?”</p>
<p>“We’d lose it. That’s four days worth of work and the eye camera is six days worth of work, and some of those parts were hard to get. Please don’t push it in fast.”</p>
<p>“How slow do I depress it?”</p>
<p>“Um. Take, like, a minute, to get it from here to here, if you can. Be ready to stop if I tell you to.”</p>
<p>“How are we communicating?”</p>
<p>“Phone?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Phone,” I said. “Got it.”</p>
<p>I checked I had my phone with me, that it had battery, and then got my earbuds, plugging them into the phone and then putting one into my ear. I collected the football-sized camera.</p>
<p>“Give me something to eat?” I asked. “Granola bar or something?”</p>
<p>Chris walked over to his bag, fished for something, and then tossed me a bag of chips. I caught it, then caught the paper-wrapped meal he threw my way. I put everything into a bag. My mask, computer and notebook were in the bag already, which was good.</p>
<p>“It’s not kiss-kill,” Rain said. “Or, like Victoria said a few days ago, it’s kiss-kill with good cover. I’m weaker than them, and the dreams give them a reason to hate me.”</p>
<p>“I’m good to go?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I think so. Thanks for doing this,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>I gave her a pat on the shoulder as I passed.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Rain said, with sincerity.</p>
<p>I was at the door when Tristan said, “Might not need the camera after all.”</p>
<p>I looked back.</p>
<p>They hadn’t gone indoors. They were in a parking lot. A group of people was standing around a van. They had masks on.</p>
<p>“I’m still going to go,” I said. “We don’t know where they’ll go or what they’ll do. Patch me in somehow?”</p>
<p>“I’ll video call you,” Kenzie said. “We’ll talk to you and you can look at your phone to see what’s happening.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “That works. That’s going to do a number on my monthly limit. I might have to get an unlimited plan.”</p>
<p>“They don’t have any of those anymore, not after the end of the world,” Kenzie said. “I checked. And they get peeved at me when I borrow anything, so I have to be really careful with my cameras and junk.”</p>
<p>I could have responded, but I didn’t want to get stuck in a conversation. I let myself outside, then flew from the top of the fire escape.</p>
<p><em>Might have to have a conversation with the big hero teams to see if they have any options,</em> I thought. It would be nice to have the fancy earbuds that the Wards used to have, or just a special phone plan that let us handle higher-bandwidth operations.</p>
<p>My phone rang in my ear, startling me even though I’d expected it. I thumbed at my phone to answer it. Rather than any of the others, it was the audio from Kenzie’s camera, observing the interaction between Snag and the group in the parking lot.</p>
<p>“…Snag. This is Love Lost,” Snag said. Recognizable enough. His voice was a deep growl. That was his ordinary voice, it seemed.</p>
<p>“Love Lost? Shouldn’t it be No Love Lost?”</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t talk,” Snag said.</p>
<p>“That might make negotiations hard.”</p>
<p>“We’ll be fine,” Snag said. “I’ll cover things.”</p>
<p>“Your friend isn’t coming? Cradle?”</p>
<p>Cradle was the potential third, then.</p>
<p>“He isn’t. Just me, just her.”</p>
<p>“I’m Secondhand, this is Last Minute, Final Hour, and End of Days.”</p>
<p>Still flying, I pulled my phone from my pocket, being careful not to drop it. I hated using my phone while airborne. It was so easy to let my guard down.</p>
<p>“Your name doesn’t match,” Snag said.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind,” Secondhand said.</p>
<p>I could see the image on my phone. I made the reel gesture to zoom in on the one I wasn’t familiar with. Tall, with an elongated face and head, bald, with an elaborate waxed mustache, and round sunglasses. He wore suspenders over a shirt that was rolled up to the elbows. The arms crossed over his chest were muscled. A bit of a steampunk vibe, even though his clothes weren’t <em>that</em> old fashioned.</p>
<p>The time manipulators had another teammate, then.</p>
<p>“You wanted to meet. Here we are,” Secondhand said.</p>
<p>“We’re similar in how we approach things,” Snag said. “Maybe we can trade, teach each other something.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Secondhand said. “Sounds good.”</p>
<p>“Maybe the deal’s lopsided in your favor, but you give us a hand when we need it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I thought that was coming. We heard you were recruiting.”</p>
<p>“Mm hmm,” Snag made the sound, and it came off more like growl than agreement.</p>
<p>“The more the merrier?” another member of the Speedrunner’s group asked. It might have been End of Days.</p>
<p>“The more the merrier,” Snag repeated, sounding the furthest thing from merry.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take a look and tell us what this means to you?” Secondhand asked.</p>
<p>There was a pause. I looked at my phone. The back door of the van opened. Snag approached, with the woman &mdash;Love Lost?&mdash; hanging a bit back. She had curved claws at her fingertips and thumb, with a thin framework of rods and bands at the back of her hands to keep those claws in place. She had more glittering around her feet and ankle. A mask covered her lower face.</p>
<p>“Victoria?” Sveta asked, through the phone.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” I asked, holding the phone to my ear, so I could use the mouthpiece there.</p>
<p>“Kenzie’s handling the camera and things. I’m hanging back, Tristan’s close. We’ll be your people, mostly. Can you tell us anything about the Speedrunners?”</p>
<p>I was glad I’d checked my books and notes.</p>
<p>“Seattle. B-list villains, but that’s partially because Seattle was setting a really high bar around the time they were active,” I said. “Partially. They’re time manipulators, but complicated by the fact that they have at least one tinker in the group. It could be that they’re all tinkers. A family thing like how forcefields run in my family.”</p>
<p>“They don’t look like family,” I heard a voice. It might have been Chris, or Rain speaking with a funny tone. Probably Chris.</p>
<p>“That’s what they’re talking about sharing, then,” I heard Tristan. “Tinker know-how.”</p>
<p>“Probably. Um. Each of them has a power, but they augment that by having tinker stuff they wear. Secondhand can cover a lot of ground really fast, but can’t affect anyone or do much while he’s doing it. Can’t hurt you, can’t move stuff, can’t set traps. But we already talked briefly about him earlier. He’s the one doing regular sweeps of the area, looking for trouble. The tinker stuff he wears reduces the strain on his body and lets him operate like that for longer. And it means that when he pops out of that mode, he does it with a boom. It gives him some offensive ability.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t feel B-list,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll get to that momentarily. I’m doing these guys out of order. Final Hour, he has a targeted slow. One target at a time, if he’s aware of them, he can slow them, as an ongoing thing. He can swap it with a moment’s notice. Tinker gear applies other effects to slowed targets. Makes it so being slow also crushes you and makes it hard to breathe, or chills you. Makes it so he can target a friend and make it so they fall slow, and reduce the impact of their landings. He had a thing which screwed with&mdash;”</p>
<p>“This works,” Snag’s growl interrupted me. “I could do something with this, if I had time to study it. I could use the engines you’ve got here to make emotion effects I channel through my tech last longer, or prolong battery life.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Secondhand said.</p>
<p>A pause. A metal on metal sound.</p>
<p>“What’s she saying?” Secondhand asked.</p>
<p>“Love Lost likes that. She thinks she could do something with it. Right? Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Doesn’t tell me much,” Secondhand said. “How about you show us something?”</p>
<p>“It’s damaged, but you should get the picture,” Snag said.</p>
<p>I checked the phone. He was using one of his overlong, mechanical arms to pull off his other arm, holding it out by gripping it at the midpoint, the shoulder near End of Days and the hand near Secondhand.</p>
<p>It was my first clean look at the whole group of Speedrunners, as Kenzie zoomed in the camera.</p>
<p>Secondhand was fairly normal in build, with goggles and a flat-top cap. He managed to not look old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Last Minute was shorter, stout, with a lot of muscle and fat both. His gadgets hung from a high-tech belt.</p>
<p>Final Hour was more muscular, with tech wrapped around one of his arms, ending in a blunt design that resembled a brass hairdryer, with red smoke pouring from the fans and vents along its length. Aside from the brass helmet he wore, which covered his entire head the armor covered only half of his body.</p>
<p>End of Days, well, I’d already gotten a look at him. He wore a mask that wrapped around his head in a broad band, from eyebrow to cheekbone, with the black sunglasses on top of that, but it was hard to imagine how he’d be less recognizable when his facial shape, lack of hair, and mustache were all so apparent.</p>
<p>“Keep going,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Where had I been? Final Hour, right. “He could attach an EMP thing to his slow that slightly hampered powers, made machinery grind to a halt. All through this oversized thing he wore that covered his arm and hand.”</p>
<p>“He’s wearing it now,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Okay, right, can’t see while I’ve got the phone to my ear. Foresight said they were using Final Hour to mask their business dealings. He was their heavy hitter and he might still be. I was thinking he might be using the EMP thing or something like it to keep people from looking in.”</p>
<p>“I hope they don’t use it,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Probably wouldn’t work outdoors,” I said. “Last Minute moves things backward in time. Emphasis on <em>things</em>. Not people. Carries an assortment of tinker boomerangs, bombs, weapons. If Secondhand didn’t have the tinker-ish name, and if there wasn’t a chance they were <em>all</em> lesser tinkers, I’d say Last Minute was a contender for the team’s tinker, with his arsenal.”</p>
<p>“What’s the catch, or what’s the tinker component?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“From what little I remember, his gadgets don’t act the same when moving in reverse, or it has added functionality while being reversed.”</p>
<p>“Fuck me,” someone said. I thought I heard someone else groan, too.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Boomerangs fly a different path, or split apart so one version carries forward and one retraces its path,” I said. “That sort of thing.”</p>
<p>I’d slowed while flying, and now I stopped. I didn’t want to enter the territory and draw attention when it wasn’t quite time. I had a sense of what Birdbrain and Braindead did, and there was a risk Secondhand would do a patrol when the meeting concluded, to see what their potential business partners were doing.</p>
<p>I settled on a roof, walking as I landed, then stopping to stand on the corner of the roof. Cedar Point was on the other side of the water, on a peninsula across from me.</p>
<p>“End of Days?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a clue,” I said. “Nothing about name or appearance stands out to me.”</p>
<p>“Fuck,” I heard a voice. Rain, I was guessing.</p>
<p>“Why are they B-list?” Tristan asked. Not the first time he’d touched on that.</p>
<p>“Because the tinker stuff is limited. The batteries take time to charge,” I said. “When they were active in Seattle, they had something like twenty days between the jobs they pulled, and they had weaknesses. The batteries ran out if engagements were prolonged and once that happens they lose a lot of their muscle.”</p>
<p>“They might have recruited End of Days to cover that weakness,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “It’s not out of the question.”</p>
<p>The Speedrunners took longer to examine Snag’s arm than Snag had taken to examine whatever they’d shown him. I watched through my phone, grieved a bit for my monthly limits, and waited.</p>
<p>On the screen, Love Lost stepped away from the meeting, walking down the length of the parking lot. She stood with her back to the group, hands at her sides, fingers and claws spread.</p>
<p>“I like her,” Ashley said. “Good style. It’s going to be a shame to smash her face in.”</p>
<p>“<em>If</em> we engage her,” Sveta said. “If we even go that far.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“What’s she doing?” I asked, more to myself than to the group.</p>
<p>It took a few more seconds, but someone walked down the street. A woman with a purple hood and antlers.</p>
<p>Prancer’s partner.</p>
<p>“Love Lost saw her coming,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Sensed,” I corrected.</p>
<p>“The woman&mdash; Love Lost, she has the emotion aspect of the power,” Rain said. “Maybe it includes some emotion sense. Detecting people.”</p>
<p>“If so, I’m glad I didn’t just drop in nearby,” I said.</p>
<p>Velvet said something. The camera didn’t catch it.</p>
<p>“Sorry!” Kenzie said. “Sorry! I didn’t have the sound camera turned that way. It’s finnicky.”</p>
<p>“Don’t turn it toward those two, stay focused on Snag’s group,” Tristan said. “Velvet’s already walking away.”</p>
<p>“It was brief,” Rain said. “I think she’s just checking on things, making sure it’s all peaceful.”</p>
<p>Love Lost rejoined the group.</p>
<p>“What did the queen of Hollow Point want?” Secondhand asked.</p>
<p>Love Lost was silent.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Are you done with my arm?” Snag asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>“I have a question, and it’s one I’d regret not asking,” Secondhand said. “Who are you with?”</p>
<p>“With?” Snag asked. “Ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I’ll elaborate. We’ve got a few cliques forming already. Bitter Pill in charge of the brains, watching, listening, planning the longer-term plays. Not necessarily here, mind you. Could be jobs elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Mm hmm.”</p>
<p>“Beast of Burden in charge of the hostiles, the ex-cons, ex-birdcage, ex-covert military, ex-cage fighters. The ones who are good or even eager when it comes to hurting people.”</p>
<p>Snag commented, “We’ve had conversations with a few of them already. Beast of Burden included. We’re looking for people who are good or even eager to deliver the hurt.”</p>
<p>“Great. We’ll keep that in mind. Final clique worth talking about, you’ve got Prancer in charge of the organization side of things. The diplomacy, recruitment, and a lot of the lower-key, ongoing business.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And I don’t think we’re going to divide up into factions and end up fighting each other. I say clique because like attracts like and sooner or later, you’ll get pulled into one of the major groups. Each serving a role.”</p>
<p>“We’re our own group,” Snag said. “We don’t care what clique you belong to. You want access to our stuff to study and see what you can learn?”</p>
<p>“We’d have to talk about it among ourselves, but I think we’re leaning that way.”</p>
<p>I looked at the phone, as the Speedrunners exchanged looks.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Secondhand said, after assessing the others. “Let’s assume we’re good to go forward with this, but we won’t set anything in stone until my friends and I have had a conversation.</p>
<p>“Preliminary offer: we pay you fifteen thousand dollars, and we give you access to our tech for study,” Snag said. “You give us access to your tech, and you lend us a hand when the time comes.”</p>
<p>“For this job you’re planning?”</p>
<p>“If you want to discuss it, I can invite others who’ve pledged to help. We’ll discuss in one of Prancer’s venues.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. We’d have to talk it over. What timeline?”</p>
<p>“Soon,” Snag said. “Anything more should wait for the discussion.”</p>
<p>“How difficult?”</p>
<p>“Hard to say. I don’t want to tell you something and have it reach the wrong ears, and there are a lot of wrong ears.”</p>
<p>“Give us some idea.”</p>
<p>“Eight or nine young people with powers, is our best guess. Mostly teenagers. We don’t know who else, or what the exact number of adult capes, allies, or other resources they might have. Teenagers are easiest to track, because they move more.”</p>
<p>Someone spoke, and I had to view my phone to check who it was. Last Minute. “Hard to say? That sounds easy to say. A minimum of eight or nine people with powers is difficult.”</p>
<p>“With the recruitment we’re planning, we’ll outnumber them three to one,” Snag said, in his characteristic growl.</p>
<p>“You’re talking people with powers? Not mooks, not henchmen?”</p>
<p>“People with powers. All going well, we’ll have them outnumbered three to one even if they call in help.”</p>
<p>“Pulled from Cedar Point?”</p>
<p>“Pulled from many places. We have a thinker contact and that contact is calling in friends. This contact and their friends are capes with names you’ve heard of, that<em> everyone</em> has heard of. We have Lord of Loss committed to the job. We have one or two others of similar caliber who may or may not participate, but who will contribute meaningful resources if they don’t show up personally.”</p>
<p>“You don’t do things by half measures,” Secondhand said.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe in half measures,” Snag said. “In the bigger job, or in our deal with you. Tech for tech, fifteen thousand for the job, but I’d like the two things bundled together. We establish a working relationship and even a mutual dependency before the job starts.”</p>
<p>“Mutual dependency?”</p>
<p>“A reason for people to second guess themselves before wondering if they can drop away at the last minute and they won’t be missed because the crowd is big enough. It was known to happen at events like Endbringer fights, before Gold Morning.”</p>
<p>“Speaking for myself, not having consulted the group…”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind that approach. We’d have to discuss the money. Spread across a four person team, it doesn’t amount to that much.”</p>
<p>“When I did the community center job…” Snag started. He paused, letting the statement hang.</p>
<p>“You did it with stipulations and expectations. Stipulations handled, expectations met,” Secondhand said. “We’re aware.”</p>
<p>“That counts for something,” Last Minute said. “It needed doing, and it was done well.”</p>
<p>“Trust that we intend to do this well,” Snag said. “The three of us have spent a year steadily working toward this. If you want more money, we could discuss it. We’d want references to justify it, a guarantee you’ll earn your keep.”</p>
<p>“I think we could manage that. Instead of money, though…”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Cradle. He’s your best tinker?”</p>
<p>“He can be.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you sweeten the pot. Include his work.”</p>
<p>“That can be arranged. You give us your references and recommendations in exchange.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I like the sound of that. We’ll talk.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Snag said.</p>
<p>Secondhand put out a hand. Snag reached out with his giant mechanical hand, enclosing it around Secondhand’s hand and forearm.</p>
<p>They all shook hands. Snag’s giant mechanical hand made for a peculiar image as it met Final Hour’s hair-dryer stub of a limb and the two shook.</p>
<p>When steampunk-ish End of Days gingerly took Love Lost’s clawed hand in his bare hand, he bent down, kissing the back of it. With her back to the camera, it was impossible to see her reaction.</p>
<p>The Speedrunners split up into two groups, two getting into an older car, and two getting into the van with the tech in the back.</p>
<p>Snag and Love Lost walked back the way they came. Love Lost turned her head to watch as the cars pulled out of the parking lot and then drove past the pair of them. The camera that was perched on the edge of the building slowly turned to follow the pair.</p>
<p>As the camera zoomed in, the sound clarifying, the metal noises of Snag’s hands periodically touching the road and Love Lost’s claws clicking were very audible.</p>
<p>Kenzie must have changed something, because the sound faded into the background.</p>
<p>“Good?” Snag asked.</p>
<p>Love Lost gave him a singular nod.</p>
<p>“They’re good to have. Versatile, and it’s good to have that tech. I can think of ten things I could do with that.”</p>
<p>Another nod.</p>
<p>“You’re good for the meeting at the pub?”</p>
<p>A final nod.</p>
<p>“Pub,” I heard Tristan say. “Kenzie? Do we deploy Victoria?”</p>
<p>“I have an address. Only pub in Cedar Point, I think. Across the street from where Prancer went inside.”</p>
<p>I brought the phone up to my face. “Love Lost might be able to sense people, and there’s Birdbrain and Braindead to account for.”</p>
<p>“It’s up to you, Victoria,” Tristan said. “But it would really, <em>really</em> help if we could get more of this kind of exchange.”</p>
<p>I stepped off the roof, realized that someone was standing on the sidewalk on the far side of the street, staring at me, and saw the alarm on their faces. I gave them my best heroic salute as I started flying instead of falling from the roof of the two-story building.</p>
<p>“Ashley and Rain are kind of quiet,” I said, to the phone.</p>
<p>“I don’t like phones, where I can’t see faces or reactions,” Ashley said. “I’m fine. This is good.”</p>
<p>“I’m not so fine,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Understandable.</p>
<p>Right. I’d maybe talk to him after, or encourage him to reach out to Yamada. Even better, he could get around to making that call to the hero teams.</p>
<p>But for now, going into enemy territory, I needed to look after myself and the mission. I now needed to make prompt decisions for things that I’d hoped I’d have a few days or weeks to think about.</p>
<p>“Radio silence unless it’s an emergency, or you need to tell me to stop deploying the camera, Kenzie,” I said.</p>
<p>I heard a faint ‘boop’.</p>
<p>No assistance, now. Just me and my intel. I put the white mask on.</p>
<p>Primary concerns: Braindead and Birdbrain. Clairvoyants both.</p>
<p>Braindead was a tactical thinker, who could designate a set area in three dimensions, setting out a rectangular prism where he sensed everything in the area. He could cover a small town with his power and have a general awareness of everything that happened in that town, but if he designated a smaller area, he got more clarity, more attention of simultaneous things at once, and he was aware of <em>stats</em>. Non-numerical values for abstract things like physical wellness, martial combat capacity, and run speed, for everyone in the area. Smaller area, more and more accurate stats.</p>
<p>The drawback was that he was a twenty-something guy that spent an awful lot of time sitting in a chair with a diaper on, drooling, mumbling, and feeling acutely uncomfortable. When his power was active, and for a time after, he was unable to act on his knowledge himself, or even to effectively defend himself. He had been on the side of the good guys, once, which was why his power information was such common knowledge. Something had changed or snapped.</p>
<p>I flew just over the rooftops. It wasn’t me flying at a height where I could pull my phone out, because there was a very real chance I could fly into something like a power line or chimney.</p>
<p>Braindead’s power operated in three dimensions. X, Y, Z. A set area of north, south, east, west, up, and down. If he wanted all of the stats and information, and if he wanted to minimize the other drawbacks of his power, like the recovery time, up and down were often the variable he could sacrifice. He could cover an area three city blocks wide along the west-east axis and three city blocks long along the north-south axis, while only covering six to ten feet of up and down.</p>
<p>Against Braindead alone, flying high and sticking to rooftops was a really safe bet, to stay out of his realm of awareness.</p>
<p>Against Birdbrain, that was a <em>weakness</em>. Birdbrain was a tactical clairvoyant of a complementary stripe to Braindead. Top-down clairvoyant awareness, much like if Kenzie operated solely through tinker eyes-in-the-sky pointed straight down. She also had thinker powers of another sort, worked into the main clairvoyant power, but she wasn’t an ex-hero, and the information wasn’t in files.</p>
<p>She was <em>really</em> good with a gun, highly mobile, and thus she was very good at defending Braindead while he was incapacitated.</p>
<p>If I stuck to rooftops, Birdbrain would detect me quickly. If I went to the ground, I’d be in Braindead’s realm.</p>
<p>I flew under things when I could, just to try to throw Birdbrain for a loop. It took me a second to orient myself and find the buildings I was looking for, even when I knew they were part of the downtown strip.</p>
<p>No sign of Snag or Love Lost. They were already inside, I hoped. With luck, I would be able to get the camera online shortly.</p>
<p>I set down on the roof, my forcefield down, and put my bag down in the corner of the roof, against the raised lip.</p>
<p>Fully aware that it was <em>very</em> likely that an eye in the sky was watching my every move, I used my body to block the view of the bag’s contents, and pulled the camera out, placing it against the corner, where the bag would shield it. I got my notebook out, opened it to an empty page, and put it across the corner of the roof, before pulling out the chips and what turned out to be curry in a pita wrap.</p>
<p>Curry in a pita was not a mix I’d run into before, but I wasn’t going to complain. I put the wrap on my notebook, weighing it down, and the chips by my bag, against the ledge of the roof.</p>
<p>My backpack shielded most of the camera from view, the notebook’s placement shielded any view of it from above.</p>
<p>I had to take it slow. I sat on the roof, leaning against the ledge, opened the bag, and adjusted the plunger. I reached into the bag, and discovered they weren’t chips, but a salted pork rind thing.</p>
<p>Urg.</p>
<p>I ate a few, penned down some general observations of the neighborhood, and then adjusted the plunger slightly downward, as part of the process of reaching down to fish for another mouthful of overly-salted pork things.</p>
<p>It took maybe a minute and a half to two minutes, because of the regular pauses here and there. I heard the ‘boop’ through my phone, took that as my signal, and pulled my phone out to cancel the call, being sure to keep it at an angle where someone watching from above me couldn’t see the phone’s face or display.</p>
<p>I was nervous, remaining where I was. Every moment I was here, I was guarding the camera, the camera was presumably filming, and we were getting information.</p>
<p>Every moment I was here, I was being watched. My forcefield was down, because having it up risked it damaging the roof, building, or the camera. The locals were getting time to figure out what to do with me.</p>
<p>We <em>wanted</em> to stir the hornet’s nest, to keep it stirred to exhaust resources and keep them from being particularly effective villains. Those same hornets could sting.</p>
<p>I ate some of Chris’ curry in a pita, just to look like I was on a typical stakeout or patrol, and I wished I’d brought a drink. I took notes, with an eye to graffiti and symbols, to names and sayings. Things I could look up later, to see if I could divine any other names or personalities that had settled in Cedar Point.</p>
<p>It was maybe five minutes in total before they decided they were uncomfortable with me being where I was. Across the street, a big guy in costume emerged. Blond haired, a metal mask with fur on it, and a combination of metal and what looked like horn or natural armor plates on a brown costume. His gauntlets looked menacing, with fur, metal, and studs.</p>
<p>He looked pretty B-list, all in all.</p>
<p>He beckoned for me to come. I wondered if I should gather my bag.</p>
<p>I decided to take a risk, leaving it where it was. I flew down to the street below.</p>
<p>“I’m Moose,” he said. “You’re unwelcome.”</p>
<p>“The last time I came, you guys called Tattletale. She told me to get lost.”</p>
<p>“Yup,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“To me, hearing that, I’m inclined to think I should show up <em>more</em>,” I said.</p>
<p>“Ahh, nope,” he said. “No, I think you’ve got the wrong inclination there, Glory Girl.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “What can you do, Moose?”</p>
<p>“What I’m going to do, Glory Girl, is I’m going to tell you how this is going to go down.”</p>
<p>“Do tell,” I said.</p>
<p>“Two brutes, like you and me, heavy hitters, we’re liable to have a brawl. I’ll avoid breaking anything breakable because I have an investment in Hollow Point here. You’ll avoid breaking stuff because you’re one of the good guys. You don’t want that bad PR.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’ll have a really polite knock-down brawl, as such things go, and you’ll trounce me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll trounce you?”</p>
<p>“I said I’d tell you how this was going to go, and I’m pretty sure that’s how it’s going to go.”</p>
<p>“Thinker power?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Only thinker power I got is decently good common sense,” Moose said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“So you’ll trounce me. Thoroughly. You’ll embarrass me, even. Not because you’re a girl and I’m a guy, but because you’re strong and you have more experience, and because fighting someone who flies is a <em>massive</em> bother.”</p>
<p>“You could surrender.”</p>
<p>“Can’t. Invested in this place. But there’s more to it, Glory Girl.”</p>
<p>“Not my name anymore, by the way.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Sorry about that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have another to give you, not yet, but I thought I’d let you know.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to stay, I gotta fight you and I gotta get trounced.”</p>
<p>“That’s a shame,” I said.</p>
<p>“But there’s more to it. I’m pulling from that common sense, now. You’ll trounce me, I’ll be embarrassed, and in the time it takes for that to happen, others are going to show up. They won’t interfere, but they’ll stand around and <em>they’ll</em> be ready to fight you if you’re insistent on staying. You’ll be outnumbered and they won’t be inclined to play fair, except that they’ll let you leave if you’re willing to leave.”</p>
<p>“Which I will.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear. Except… can we just skip straight to the part where you leave? I don’t want to be embarrassed and you don’t want to run scared from a group of menacing looking capes.”</p>
<p>“I’m supposed to run scared from you instead, Moose?”</p>
<p>“You can knock me around as you make your exit, if you’d like.”</p>
<p>“Really?” I asked, a little incredulous.</p>
<p>He shrugged.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a trap?”</p>
<p>“Nope.”</p>
<p>I used my flight, and rose up off the ground. He didn’t react.</p>
<p>I flew at him, forcefield up, fist out.</p>
<p>He met my fist with his, moving faster than I’d expected. The shockwave from the impact knocked me back and up into the air. I righted myself and hovered on the spot, ten or so feet off the ground.</p>
<p>The shockwave was weird. Intense, and focused. There was more to that Brute power.</p>
<p>“I can’t embarrass myself too badly,” he said. “There’s an audience.”</p>
<p>I looked.</p>
<p>In the window of the pub, Snag had risen to his feet. Love Lost was sitting, still, watching through the window. There were a handful of others.</p>
<p>I met Snag’s eyes momentarily, and tried to look a little surprised.</p>
<p>Then I flew at Moose again. I pushed out with my aura.</p>
<p>His reaction to the fear and awe was to strike out, a solid punch, not a reckless one like most would throw reactively. I didn’t follow the awe with an attack, and I was glad I hadn’t, because the chances were good that I would’ve been hit.</p>
<p>Instead, I used his momentary bewilderment to fly over his head, because it was easy to do, it required him to turn around. Better yet, it involved a lot of readjustment of footing and balance, at the same time he was recovering from the emotional hit.</p>
<p>Watching, waiting, feeling more like the warrior monk as I used this approach, I tried to identify the time his footing was still off, his awareness of me imperfect, and I dove, striking him with one foot in the collarbone.</p>
<p>In the process, the wretch decided to strike out too. It hit him across the face, knocking the mask off. I saw blood, and the tracks of fingernails.</p>
<p>He fell, and he sat there, his head turned away from me, one gauntlet-covered hand moving to his face.</p>
<p>“You okay?” I asked, flying up and looking away. I didn’t want to be accused of peering beneath the mask.</p>
<p>“I’ll mend,” he said.</p>
<p>I didn’t wait, and I didn’t look back. Back to my notebook, to my bag and book and Chris’ meal. I packed it up, collecting the camera.</p>
<p>When I’d crossed the water and reached the edge of the neighborhood where the hideout was, I called the others.</p>
<p>“Thanks for that, Victoria,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“How’d we do?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t get the very start and we didn’t get what would’ve been the end, but we got some, and I think everyone’s happy with that,” she said. “You okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m alright.”</p>
<p>“Come back. We’ll talk, and you can see what we got.”</p>
<p>I flew back. I didn’t fly in a straight line, being mindful of any possible pursuers, and I flew lower to the ground as I drew closer to the building where the place we were renting was. I landed at the edge of the lot and walked to the fire escape.</p>
<p>Ashley, Sveta, Kenzie and Chris were all present. They were watching a distorted and monochrome image of the inside of the pub, projected on the wall.</p>
<p>I noted the absence of Tristan and Rain.</p>
<p>“He ran,” Ashley said, her voice low.</p>
<p>“Rain?”</p>
<p>“He got spooked,” she said. “Tristan went after him.”</p>
<p>“To reassure,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Chris reached past Kenzie to hit keys on the keyboard. The image on the projector screen changed.</p>
<p>“You suck at that,” Kenzie said, elbowing him. “Here.”</p>
<p>The image was distorted, as if viewing something underwater, with a film of grime on the lens. The sound, however, was only slightly muted.</p>
<p>“You really want this kid to suffer.”</p>
<p>“We want him to face a fate worse than death,” Snag said. “But we can’t have that and have him dead at the same time, and we need him dead. If he suffers as much as possible along the way to that conclusion, we’ll be satisfied.”</p>
<p>“If you’re paying, we can satisf&mdash;”</p>
<p>The message cut off as Kenzie hit a key. She looked back at me, shooting me what might’ve been an attempt at a reassuring smile. Not so reassuring.</p>
<p>“We’ll figure something out,” I said, to myself as much as them.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap37">Shade &mdash; Interlude 4a</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p><i>It’s his turn tonight.</i></p>
<p>They ran, they pushed forward. A crush of people.</p>
<p>Smoke billowed, and it smelled like burning rubber. For all the chaos, the noises seemed muted, dulled in how the individual elements mixed, the bodies absorbing the sound. Shouts here and there cut through the cries, the noise of people, the sound of something falling down, but people further ahead in the crowd were actively grabbing others and shoving them to the side, dragging them out of the way.</p>
<p>Even with the high ceiling, the haze of smoke made the exit sign above the door hard to see. The point of view blurred, blacked out for an instant as the person blinked.</p>
<p>“Lancaster fire&mdash;” the point of view said, more to himself. His voice soon rose to a bellow. “Don’t&mdash; don’t stampede! Don’t shove! We’ll get crammed at the exit!”</p>
<p>The smoke got to him, and he coughed, hard.</p>
<p>He tried to slow, as if he could influence the crowd. The force of people behind him pushed him forward, as heavy as he was. He was a big guy. Big around the middle, more. Only a bit taller than average. It was enough that he could almost see over the heads of the crowd.</p>
<p>He saw a young girl fall, and very nearly tripped over her. To do so might have killed them both. He fell to his knees beside her, grabbing at the edge of a sign on the wall to brace himself, one arm around the girl. He became a barrier, battered by those behind him. Feet scraped at his back, trying to climb over him.</p>
<p>He watched as the people pushed further down. He knew what was happening as it happened. That the press of bodies was keeping people from being able to get the door open, that by the time people realized there was no way forward, the people behind them would keep them from retreating. There would only be the inexorable, forward pressure.</p>
<p>Straining, every movement made harder by people leaning against him or pushing past him, nearly being knocked over to crush the girl in front of him on three occasions, he rose to his feet. For what seemed like a minute, it was all he could do to hold his position.</p>
<p>He looked back, and there was only smoke, people pushing toward the exit. He looked toward the exit sign, and there was only the press, people crammed together until they were chest-to-back, shoulder-to-shoulder.</p>
<p>He looked around, at the trash cans, at the signs that were built into the wall, frames sticking an inch or two out, locked plexiglass doors protecting the contents from vandalism. He looked up, and he saw the windows and the glass ceiling above the corridor that led out of the mall. There were high windows that let the light in, and there were latches on those windows.</p>
<p>He reached down, and the young girl shied away.</p>
<p>“Up!” he said. He seized her arm, and as he leaned down, someone bumped into him. He nearly fell on her. Only his grip on the side of one of the sign-frames kept him from falling.</p>
<p>He drove an elbow back, striking at the person who had pushed him. With more energy, desperation, he reached down to seize the girl’s arm, lifted her bodily into the air, and shifted his grip, grabbing her body to lift her.</p>
<p>“Grab on and climb!” he called out. “Get to the window!”</p>
<p>She tried. Sneakers slid against the plexiglass. Fingers gripped the ledge, and even with him boosting her, she couldn’t get up. She wasn’t even looking at what she was doing, as she turned her face down and away from the thicker smoke.</p>
<p>Further down the hallway, a group of people fell like dominoes. For those who wanted to get away, get to the exit, people who couldn’t necessarily see past the smoke or the people immediately in front of them, it was an opening, a way to get forward. The mob moved forward. A woman screamed, a multi-note sound.</p>
<p>Seizing the opportunity, only seeing the gap, people pushed past him, bumped into him. He was holding the girl as he stumbled, and he dropped her. He doubled over, coughing, trying to keep from getting dragged forward. He was a big guy and the movement of the crowd was such that his feet left the ground at points, when people pressed closer.</p>
<p>The girl, too, coughed. She looked at him, wide-eyed, until the smoke forced her to close her eyes, and then she ran for the exit, slipping from his reaching fingers, dodging into a gap of bodies, toward the press, where people were barely able to move. People were panicking in places, voices reaching high pitches.</p>
<p>“No!” he bellowed at the girl. His voice was lost in the chaos.</p>
<p>She nearly fell to the ground amid trampling feet as someone stumbled into her. Then she was gone.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sign, and he reached, digging fingers in where the sign and the wall were. He stepped on someone, tried to climb toward the window, eye on the latch, darting over to look at the smoke behind him, then up to where the smoke was thick near the ceiling. The plexiglass front of the sign was a hinge, so it could be opened, and he dug his finger into that gap for the leverage it could afford.</p>
<p>The climb would have been hard on its own, but he was jostled. His hand slipped, and both his fingernail and the tip of his finger tore off as his hand came away from the hinge. A thin streak of blood was drawn on the plexiglass.</p>
<p>Someone slid between him and the wall, and he was no longer able to hold himself up. He landed on the ground, and people walked over him. His efforts to stand were defeated by the feet trampling him. He couldn’t stop coughing, and his vision distorted from the effort.</p>
<p>Behind them, the fire and smoke were getting worse.</p>
<p>He looked up, vision warped to the point that up and down and left and right were no longer clear, he looked at the walls that stretched skyward, the glass ceiling high above, the bodies pressed around him and over him. The view blurred with the tears in his eyes, growing dark as the people closed in above him.</p>
<p>The image distorted, going black, and he saw stars, flying past him, as if he was being buoyed elsewhere.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>A scene faded, unremembered. Points of light became light. Darkness became shadows in a large, dark room.</p>
<p>There was no skylight, no corridor, no crowd or mall. In the center of the room was a spike of twisted metal and glass topped by what looked like a sundial without a marker. Light shone through the glass as if it was coming through the other side, but no source could be seen. The different tints of the red-blue-purple light divided the room into four sections, with a fifth left dark. Each section was littered with debris of different sorts.</p>
<p>Without even needing to look to check the position, Rain reached down for the chair. Always in the same place, the same position. The floor in his section was dilapidated. Uneven floorboards with spaces between them. There were scattered books, tools that looked like they hadn’t been touched in a while, and some assorted branches and dry pine needles, as if it was a space that had been exposed to the elements. He put the chair down on the ground.</p>
<p>“I don’t suppose you guys are willing to talk?” he asked. Again, he didn’t even need to look or check the position of the others. He knew where they would be.</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>The memory had been Snag’s, and Snag was the first to really move. Snag wasn’t as big as he had once been. Still tall, but he had lost a lot of weight. The beard he’d had before was longer now, shaggier. So was his hair. There were streaks of paler hair at the corners of his mouth. The hood of a sweatshirt and the lack of clear lighting masked much of the man’s face, so only the beard was visible. Snag’s area was a store without things. Empty display cabinets, cracked glass, metal shelves, a lacquered floor, and more diffuse light than the other spaces.</p>
<p>Snag reached the table, and slammed one hand down on the surface. He gripped the edges, hunched over.</p>
<p>Someone else spoke, quiet enough he was almost inaudible. It was how he usually talked. “You two should know I’m looking into our situation here. I’ll be experimenting soon, so you should know things might get weird.”</p>
<p>A young man. Nondescript. Boring. Blond hair, average weight, clothes without labels, a bit older than Rain at eighteen or so. The slabs of concrete and tile made his space look like a hall of mirrors after an earthquake, if the glass was opaque concrete instead. Shattered, dark, claustrophobic, devoid of the human touch. The only thing about him that stood out was that his glasses were scratched up, to the point where it wasn’t possible to see his eyes. He held his head at funny angles to see through the less scratched part, chin high, looking down, or head bent, looking up and out.</p>
<p>Rain had taken to thinking of him as the recluse. The guy had talked before about not spending much time around people. He was quiet, weird, and his dreams weirder still.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been including Rain in the ‘you two’.</p>
<p>“What experiment?” Snag asked, his voice hoarse enough to be a growl.</p>
<p>“I’m reaching out to someone. They do interesting things with people and sleep. I have no clue what’s going to happen, but it’s possible I won’t show up, or I’ll have a guest. Tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The woman approached, standing from a sitting position in a squat, small armchair. She stepped over stuffed animals and broken toys.</p>
<p>She was elegant, wearing an ankle-length dress with a slit up one side. Her hair was styled into waves and curls. She wore earrings and a necklace, heels, and her nails were painted. None of her tinker gear was present.</p>
<p>Her lower face was covered in the mask that could have been described as a muzzle, it clung so tightly to her face, covering nose and mouth. It was black leather, and it had real teeth set into it. Fangs.</p>
<p>Her eyes were more vicious than the snarling maw. She stared Rain down until she’d reached the plate of crystal at the center of the room, and turned around to sit with her back to the thing. To Rain. Her head turned toward the recluse, and she tapped one long fingernail to one of the teeth of her mask, her <i>muzzle</i>, before pointing it down, knuckle resting against the mask.</p>
<p>“Yeah, actually,” the recluse said. “You know ‘em?”</p>
<p>The woman offered one, singular nod.</p>
<p>“Any advice?”</p>
<p>“Why ask? She doesn’t talk,” Rain said.</p>
<p>The recluse ignored him.</p>
<p>The woman turned, reaching down to the dias. Rain drew closer to watch as she picked her way through the assorted debris on the table. The wood was burned and as delicate as charcoal, breaking apart at a touch, crumbling into dust as it fell to the five-sided plate. Almost everything on the table was similarly fragile. The glass, the rusty scraps of metal.</p>
<p>She picked out three human teeth, and slid two of them in the recluse’s direction.</p>
<p>“She’s dangerous?” The recluse asked.</p>
<p>Another nod from the muzzled woman. She tapped a finger on the one remaining tooth on her part of the table.</p>
<p>“I really appreciate that,” the recluse said. “I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“I have a suggestion,” Snag said. Growled. He was pacing a little, hand brushing against his edge of the plate as he walked beside it. One of his fingers was still damaged from the event a year ago.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do it tomorrow night,” Snag said, stopping.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>Snag turned his head, staring at the darkness that separated his section from Rain’s. He was almost but not quite looking at Rain, shadows heavy around his eyes as he glared. “Tomorrow is your night. The night after is hers.”</p>
<p>The recluse turned to look at the muzzled woman.</p>
<p>Snag said, “Let’s do it the night after hers. In case something goes wrong.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense,” the recluse said.</p>
<p><i>On my night,</i> Rain thought.</p>
<p>Rain approached the table. He kept a wary eye on the others as he picked up the debris, destroying it in his hands. Almost everything was so old, burned, water damaged or rusty that it disintegrated with firm contact. He cast it aside, letting it litter the floor. The items scraped and cut his hands on contact, but he didn’t mind.</p>
<p>There were only three items he couldn’t destroy. Scraps of metal, too dull and thick to be knives, too flat and featureless to be of any particular use. Like rectangular pieces of a broken glass, but not glass.</p>
<p>The others were sorting themselves out. Five shards of glass for Snag, three coins for the recluse. The muzzled woman stared him down. She’d already handed out two of the teeth that served as her token, keeping one for herself.</p>
<p>Even the others, when they glanced at him, radiated hostility.</p>
<p>“I need to update up one of my arms,” Snag said, his voice low. He glanced at Rain and turned his back, leaning against the table as he leaned closer to the recluse, lowering his voice further. “I made a replacement, I want to make the other match it.”</p>
<p>“Today?” the recluse asked, picking up one of the tarnished coins.</p>
<p>“Hmm. I’m not sure I’ll have time.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine either way, for me. You?” The recluse turned toward the muzzled woman for that last bit.</p>
<p>The muzzled woman nodded.</p>
<p>Snag slid a piece of glass across the table, to the recluse’s side. His fingertips stopped at the boundary, and the recluse reached over to slide the glass the rest of the way.</p>
<p>“I guess I get to be pretty strong today,” the recluse said.</p>
<p>“You won’t need your workshop,” Snag said. “And we could use a better sense of tech, for reasons we discussed on the phone. Give me your share tomorrow, too, and I won’t need it for a while.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind,” the recluse said. He passed the coins over to the others. Two for Snag. One for the muzzled woman.</p>
<p>Rain looked down at his rectangles of metal. They hadn’t asked, and he hadn’t offered. He had, once, trying to curry favor. He’d given them his tokens and he’d never received a thing in return.</p>
<p>He kept the three rectangles of metal in his section of the table.</p>
<p>Rain took a seat in the creaky wooden chair and he waited for dawn, listening and hearing nothing of consequence while the three people talked, or, well, two of them talked and the muzzled woman listened.</p>
<p>He’d tried to reason. He’d tried to talk. He’d tried being angry. There was no use. The only option left was to wait until dawn, and try to listen, to act dumb, and drop comments here and there that could mislead.</p>
<p>He looked over to his left at the dark fifth of the room. No details, no debris, no light. No tokens on the table.</p>
<p>He gripped the three pieces of metal in his hands until the edges cut into his fingers and blood oozed out between them.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Rain. Wake up.”</p>
<p>Rain’s eyes opened. No dreams, not really. Only someone else’s recollections and then the room. He felt more tired than he had when his head had hit the pillow. He had a headache and every part of him felt heavy.</p>
<p>“School,” his aunt said, from the bedroom door, her face peering through the crack.</p>
<p>He sat up.</p>
<p>“Go downstairs to eat before you shower, if you’re going to shower. The girls are making breakfast.”</p>
<p>“I will,” he said, before adding an automatic, “thank you auntie.”</p>
<p>She left the door open as she left. Rain was annoyed, but held his tongue.</p>
<p>Swinging his feet over to the side of the bed, he looked at his hands, turning them over. There was no sign of the dirt, grit. No damage from moving the objects on the five sided table, no cuts on his fingers or blood on the back of his hand.</p>
<p>As he often did, he reached out for his individual powers. His own power was at its ordinary strength. The scythes of shimmering, flickering light appeared in each of his hands. It felt right.</p>
<p>The emotion power&mdash; he reached for it and cast it out over the empty space in the middle of his room. He was aware of it like he’d be aware of a patch of shade. The effectiveness wasn’t much sharper than creating the shade would be.</p>
<p>When he reached for the tinker power, the ideas that came to mind were paltry, barely much better than how he might manage setting up a snare or the steps for forging a knife. He wasn’t even especially good at those things.</p>
<p>That left the mover power. He used it to get to his feet, pushing himself out of bed and using the power rather than his balance to steady himself.</p>
<p>He’d slept in a t-shirt and boxers, and felt exposed as he canceled out the arrested movement of the mover power, stepped over to the door and shut it. He pulled on a dirty pair of jeans and ran his fingers through his shoulder-length hair until it was reasonable.</p>
<p>His family tended to subscribe to the notion that the kitchen was the center of the home. The buildings that had been erected for the settlement were set up in a way that made for large kitchens. Wood was burning at a massive brick stove with room for six frying pans on it, and there were two girls Rain’s age handling food there. He couldn’t quite remember their names. Heather and Lauren, maybe. Or was one of them Jean? He’d seen them around, but they didn’t go to the school and they’d never talked to him.</p>
<p>Rain’s auntie was at the counter, grating potatoes. Her daughter, Rain’s cousin Allie, stood talking to one of the men that was sitting at the table, while she took her time drying a dish.</p>
<p>Rain knew only one of the men at the table&mdash; an uncle, who had said ten words at most in all the time Rain knew him. There was no introduction made for the other two men who sat there.</p>
<p>As good as the food was, as much as the stove was warm and the family close and busy, it wasn’t warm in atmosphere. There was no small talk. There were some glances from Allie, who was washing and drying, and from the girls at the stove. The glances were reserved for when they thought he wasn’t looking.</p>
<p>They weren’t kind looks.</p>
<p>Hash browns, ‘made properly’, his Aunt would say, and french toast cut in thick slices from homemade bread. The bread that wasn’t being used to make french toast was sitting in a basket on the table, with jam and butter sitting nearby. With the production that went into cooking, there was a lot of pressure to eat, to get full. For most, it was necessary, with long days of hard work on the farms.</p>
<p>Not that Rain worked on the farms much.</p>
<p>“Thank you for breakfast,” he said.</p>
<p>The girls didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“You gonna have a shower?” his aunt asked.</p>
<p>“A quick one,” he said.</p>
<p>“Stomp when you’re done,” she said, turning the knob at the base of the sink’s faucet, cutting off the water. The plumbing in the house wasn’t great, and the cold water being turned on meant the shower water would scald.</p>
<p>He gathered his dishes.</p>
<p>“You can leave that for the girls.”</p>
<p>“I already got it,” he said.</p>
<p>He collected a few more things, aware of the looks from the men sitting around the table, and took them to the side of the sink where the dirty pans and dishes were waiting to be washed.</p>
<p>Allie, standing next to him, pulled a knife out of the drying rack. The metal made a sound as it ran against the side of the rack, singing slightly in the wake of it. Between that, the weapon, the hostility he felt from the two girls at the stove, he shivered slightly. He looked out the window.</p>
<p><em>Those people I saw in my dream want me dead.</em></p>
<p>He’d paused too long, lost in thought, being as tired as he was. He was very aware of the stares, of the long looks from the men at the table, his uncle excepted. The girls had paused in their work.</p>
<p>“What?” his aunt asked, her voice sharp. She glanced at the girls. Her voice was sharper as she asked, “What, do you need someone to come up and wash you?”</p>
<p>“Gross,” one of the girls at the stove said.</p>
<p>“Hey!” one of the men barked the word. The girl jumped. A rebuke without any elaboration.</p>
<p>“No, auntie, I was just thinking,” Rain said, feeling his face get hot.</p>
<p>“Then save the thinking for school and get going. We need the sink free to finish the dishes.”</p>
<p>He got going.</p>
<p>The shower was hot, even with the cold water cranked all the way around, and he rushed through the process of getting clean. The soap, spooned out of a jar with a wooden spatula to his hands, then applied to the critical areas, was a gooey mess derived from animal fat and ash. He had no idea what the shampoo was, but it was harsh enough to make his scalp hurt, so he only used it every two or three days.</p>
<p>He had scratches and bruises, only some of them from his time with Victoria and the team. He was ginger with them all, checked for the redness of infection, and dabbed them dry instead of toweling more roughly as he finished showering and started getting dry. He stomped hard on the floor, three times, as he stepped out of the shower. The pipes knocked as the water downstairs was turned on again.</p>
<p>The recluse was planning something for three nights from now. He needed to plan, conserve strength. It was possible he would be incapacitated, if the others found a way to hijack the rotation or interfere with his days.</p>
<p>His thoughts were occupied with the logistics and conversations he’d need to have as he wrapped a towel around his waist, checked for chin scruff, and then crossed the hall to enter his room. Clean clothes, bag, shoes.</p>
<p>He did his best to stay out of sight of the kitchen as he headed downstairs, ducking into the front hall and out the door.</p>
<p>The dirt road cut a zig-zagging line between homes and fields. Things had been situated in a way that had been convenient at the time, but the layout didn’t make for good town planning otherwise. Other students were walking to school, older siblings watching the younger ones, friends meeting to talk. Some parents walked with their children to supervise. Other adults were around to supervise. The notorious and inevitable Mrs. Sims was bitching at a group of the fifth graders, splitting up groups of friends to make the boys and girls walk on different sides of the road.</p>
<p>A truck came down the road, and the students moved to the muddy sides where the ground was far softer. It was Jay, stopping periodically to let friends hop into the back.</p>
<p>A short distance behind Rain, Jay stopped in plain view of Mrs. Sims to ask Brianna and Kaylyn Barr if they wanted to ride in the truck, which was already mostly packed with senior boys.</p>
<p>The sisters climbed into the back of the pickup truck. Mrs. Sims scowled, but she kept her mouth shut.</p>
<p>The truck moved a little bit further down the road and stopped beside Rain. Jay leaned past his girlfriend. He had thin facial hair, a baseball cap, and a sweatshirt with a logo on it. The sweatshirt and cap looked brand new, and they also looked like they were from Bet, with the quality and logos. Expensive.</p>
<p>“You want a ride, rain man?” Jay asked.</p>
<p>“No thanks. Walking with a friend.”</p>
<p>“I know who you’re talking about. You know you don’t have the slightest chance with her, right?”</p>
<p>“Of being her friend?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, right,” Jay said. He rolled his eyes. “Enjoy that walk.”</p>
<p>The wheels spun against the dirt road before finding traction. The pickup truck bucked a little with the uneven transition, nearly tossing Kaylyn Barr out the back as the back end came up. Only a quick grab by one of the older boys saved her from a tumble.</p>
<p>A cloud of dust followed behind it. If it was meant to annoy Rain, it didn’t. He turned his back to the worst of the cloud, looking out at the farmland.</p>
<p>“Rain!” Mrs. Sims called out. Some of the smaller students on the road flinched.</p>
<p>Rain looked more her way.</p>
<p>“Get yourself straight to school. Don’t dawdle,” she said.</p>
<p>He could have said something about that. Jay might have. If he hadn’t had the experiences he had, he might even have called her an evil person, said she deserved it. She was an artifact of a prior era, the kind of person who had lived in every small town and rural community he’d known; she was someone who used morality as a stick to beat others with. He could have asked what she was implying, or challenged her.</p>
<p>He didn’t.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am,” he said. “Just waiting for the dust to settle so I’m not walking face-first into it.”</p>
<p>Someone else might have made a comment, empathized. Mrs. Sims only said, “Go to school. Be a better example for the little ones.”</p>
<p>He walked.</p>
<p>The people like Mrs. Sims and his aunt were easier to deal with than many of the alternatives. He could understand the people who’d reacted to hurt and loss by becoming harder. He wished he’d been able to do the same, a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Erin emerged from her house as he reached the mailbox staked out in front. He waited while she made her way down, her little brother following.</p>
<p>It was hard not to have his eyes linger on her. She wore a plum colored muscle tank with a cross in black on the front, a black choker with a steel buckle, and black jeans. The jewelry in her ears matched the buckle of the choker, a series of rings in her left ear and a single piece of jewelry in the right, glittering in the sun as she steered her brother along the path.</p>
<p>He’d come to dislike the muscle tops with those oversized armholes on principle, after seeing so many girls he couldn’t stand wearing them as a trashy sort of look. Seeing Erin wear it and look so stunning, he found himself doing a one-eighty on the position on the spot.</p>
<p>“Hey, Erin, hey bruiser,” he said. He stuck out his hand, like he might for a handshake, and Bryce slapped it in a high-five. He and Rain reversed the directions their hands were moving to lightly slap the backs of their hands together, and Bryce moved forward to mock-punch Rain in the hip, then thigh. The third punch missed Rain’s groin only because of a timely twist to one side.</p>
<p>“Careful with Rain, Bry. He looks a little battered, he doesn’t need you giving him more bruises,” Erin said, putting one hand on Bryce’s forehead, pulling him back while Bryce continued punching at the air.</p>
<p>“He’s coming to school with us?” Rain asked. “I didn’t think he went to school.”</p>
<p>“Next year,” Bryce said.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to drop him off at church. He’s being punished, and somehow my parents think a sermon is going to give him direction.”</p>
<p>“What did you do, Bry?”</p>
<p>“I said mean things about Elijah,” Bryce said. “Mr. Jean heard and tattled.”</p>
<p>“You need to be careful who you talk about and how,” Erin said. “You don’t want to upset anyone. What if Elijah heard?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” Bryce said.</p>
<p>Erin gave Rain a look, from an angle Bryce wasn’t meant to see. Worried, unsure. “You don’t have to come.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Erin said.</p>
<p>Bryce spotted his friends walking down the road with their older siblings, and started to walk that way. Erin bent down, putting her hands on Bryce’s shoulders to catch him. “Nuh uh, Bry. You’re supposed to be in trouble. You walk with us.”</p>
<p>She steered Bryce in the other direction, toward school and church, and as she turned, bent over, Rain saw through the oversized armhole of her top. Stomach, ribs, lacy black bra strap, bra, and a bit of what the bra was meant to support. The look had been automatic, and the moment he realized what he was looking at, he looked away.</p>
<p>He had very complicated feelings on those tops, now, as he found himself simultaneously trying to memorize every detail of what he’d seen and prepared himself so he wouldn’t be an asshole and look again at what she didn’t necessarily intend to show him. He was well aware of how the two things conflicted.</p>
<p>“Are you doing okay?” she asked him. “You’re a little scraped up.”</p>
<p>“I’m always a little scraped up. I’m used to it.”</p>
<p>They walked, Bryce between the two of them.</p>
<p>“I’ve officially watched the last of the videos from the library. Even the bad ones, like E.T.3,” Erin said. “I’m stuck reading and rewatching stuff until they get more.”</p>
<p>“Reading isn’t so bad,” Rain said. “There were five years where my family didn’t even have power at the place we were staying.”</p>
<p>“Every time you talk about your past my heart hurts a little. No TV? No music?”</p>
<p>“Reading by candlelight. Hobbies. You figure out how to entertain yourself. There was a summer some other kids and I dug a hole and covered it with slats of wood, and we called it our hideout.”</p>
<p>Erin pressed the heel of her hand to her heart.</p>
<p>“It was a good hideout. Really.”</p>
<p>“You were so deprived you couldn’t even build a treehouse.”</p>
<p>“We could’ve. We wanted to dig a hole. We covered it with dirt and sticks so people wouldn’t know it was even there, if they didn’t see the hole.”</p>
<p>“How old were you?”</p>
<p>“Ten? Eleven? About Kenzie’s age, I think.”</p>
<p>“When I was eleven? I think we went to Disneyworld at the start of summer. And I had six weeks of camp with the most irresponsible camp counselors. Tons of food we shouldn’t have been allowed to have, swimming, mud Olympics. One of the boys fell on the mud slide and broke two of his fingers.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to imagine you being eleven.”</p>
<p>“I was the most awesome eleven year old. Man, I really wanted to go back there the next year, but I think our parents all shared notes and realized how dangerous it was.”</p>
<p>“When I was twelve, I think I spent the summer hunting with my dad’s best friend.”</p>
<p>“That sounds neat.”</p>
<p>“It&mdash; no. No, it really wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Aw,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“Dull, wet, buggy. I got to shoot the gun once in three months. I missed.”</p>
<p>“Aww.”</p>
<p>“I was so excited to get back home and see my friends, get back to my routine. Then… no home to go back to. The trip with my dad’s friend was just to buy time for my parents to get everything sorted out for me to go live with my aunt.”</p>
<p>Rain was caught between a yawn and something that might have actually reflected his feelings, and decided to yawn.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Erin said.</p>
<p>Rain shrugged.</p>
<p>“How’d you manage last night?”</p>
<p>She was asking about the dream, as much as she could with Bryce listening in.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t too bad. Pretty usual. I’m tired.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You gonna grab a nap later?”</p>
<p>“I might. Have to get through school first, and I’m already feeling like I’ll doze because I have a full belly. I woke up to three girls around my age cooking breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Barefoot in the kitchen? Not going to school?”</p>
<p>“Pretty much,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Spending time with you, seeing how you stack up?”</p>
<p>“I’m the one that’s supposed to be studying or showing interest in them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Creepy as&mdash;” Erin paused to put her hands over Bryce’s ears, “&mdash;shit.”</p>
<p>Bryce pushed her hands away, nearly hitting her with the stick he held. He was drawing a line in the dirt road as he walked, with an apparent system in mind about how he did it.</p>
<p>“Creepier when one of them’s my cousin. I’m pretty sure she’s my actual cousin, too. It’s hard to keep track.”</p>
<p>“Allie?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“She’s not so bad. She played the guitar at one of the campfires a bit ago, she was good, and she’s nice, she was nice to Bryce when she was helping out the teachers during a nature hike, even though she hates me.”</p>
<p>“She’s my cousin, Erin.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, if you’re going to have cross-eyed underbite babies, you could do worse.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>“It’s better to stick to the ones you aren’t related to,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to stick to anyone,” Rain said. “I’m not interested.”</p>
<p>“They can apply a lot of pressure. You might end up having to choose one of them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even know the names of the other two girls.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like another point in Allie’s favor, then.”</p>
<p>“<i>Stop.</i> Please. Have mercy.”</p>
<p>Erin stretched, fingers knit together, hands turned outward and up over her head. The black band of her bra jumped into Rain’s attention and shook him the same way a wildcat leaping in his direction might. What kept his attention was her profile: the way the sun outlined her face, throat, chest. He looked away, his heart now thudding.</p>
<p>She was so beautiful he couldn’t believe they were talking together. Her and him? What the hell had he been saying before about spending a summer sitting in a hole? What was wrong with him?</p>
<p>She sighed heavily as she stopped stretching.</p>
<p>“My family’s been making those noises,” she said.</p>
<p>Rain glanced at her. For someone who had been joking a moment ago, Erin looked so sad.</p>
<p>“How bad?” he asked. He swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“These days? Bad. It’s all they think about. Every conversation, if it runs for more than a minute or two, turns to how pretty I am, and if I have any suitors.”</p>
<p>“You’re talking about the marriage thing?” Bryce asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Our parents talk about it a lot,” Bryce said. “With Erin, I mean. I’m too young to get married.”</p>
<p>“So are Rain and I,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“Rain?”</p>
<p>“Rain’s getting bugged too,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“I’m getting hints. Girls showing up with chaperones, when they really don’t want to be there, but it’s subtle. Nobody really talks about it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Lucky you,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“Are you managing okay?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been going over to the junkyard to shoot at bottles. That helps,” Erin said. She had a serious look on her face. “Might be good to have the practice if you ever need help.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to get you involved.”</p>
<p>“Getting caught up in your thing would be a relief,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’m not so sure it would,” he said. He glanced at Bryce, to see if the boy was listening.</p>
<p>Nope, drawing wiggly lines in the dirt with his stick.</p>
<p>They were close to the church. There was no parking lot, so the cars and trucks were parked haphazardly. Some were moving at a crawl as they tried to navigate the parked vehicles and the people who were gathering.</p>
<p>Rain glanced at Jay’s truck as they found a path between cars to reach the church. Jay was here, then. Rain was left to wonder whether the Barr sisters had hopped out and headed on their way to school, or if they were attending the morning service, now.</p>
<p>Erin drew looks. She stood out, and not just because she wasn’t a usual for the morning service. It was in moments like this that Rain knew he wasn’t letting feelings color his views on her. He could see the way people acted around her, the way they looked at her.</p>
<p>He was spooked, seeing it. He knew who these people were, he’d grown up with them, and he knew how they functioned. On a level, he was one of them.</p>
<p>Erin took Bryce to one of the moms of one of Bryce’s friends. They exchanged words, and the mom scooted over, having Bryce sit next to her.</p>
<p>Rain was acutely aware of the looks <em>he</em> got too. The opposite of the ones Erin got, really.</p>
<p>Erin joined Rain at the door. People were still filing in.</p>
<p>At the front of the church, a shirtless man climbed up onto the stage and walked back to the sanctuary, where the altar was. The light shone through the stained glass window behind him. He was skinny, long-haired, and tattooed.</p>
<p>“Yo, faithful,” he said, leaning over the altar.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of responses from the congregation.</p>
<p>“I’ve been watching, and I’ve been thinking. You guys have been asking me when I’d speak again, and I think it’s time I say a few things.”</p>
<p>There was a louder murmur, with a few hoots and whistles from certain locations.</p>
<p>“We’ve had some hard days,” he said. “Less jobs, the strikes, the talk of war, it’s getting colder out, and I think that reminds us all of winter. Last winter <em>sucked</em>.”</p>
<p>There were more murmured responses.</p>
<p>“It was cold, there wasn’t enough shelter, there wasn’t enough food. Not everyone made it. We did better than some, but we lost six. We remember them. Jack, Josh, Georgia, Kiara, Christian and Rhys. We remember them, and we remember the cold, hunger, and sickness that took them from us.”</p>
<p>The responses were more animated.</p>
<p>“May they be with the Lord.”</p>
<p>It demanded a response. More of a response than the last.</p>
<p>“We remember the bad days, we remember the <em>end</em>. While I was doing that watching, listening, and thinking, I could tell. People are <em>scared</em>.”</p>
<p>His tanned face was expressive as he emphasized words like ‘end’ and ‘scared’, lines crinkling in around his eyes, betraying him as thirty-something. He gripped the podium as he talked.</p>
<p>“All through the city, through the many worlds, people are scared <em>shitless</em>. Bad days are coming. Everyone knows it. You know it, am I right?”</p>
<p>There was a more vocal response.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you know it,” he said, his chin rising a bit. “You <em>fucking</em> know it. Sorry parents, you can cover your kids’ ears if you’re shy, but this is how I talk. Honest. I’m gonna be honest with you.”</p>
<p>Rain looked at Bryce and the woman he sat with. She wasn’t covering Bryce’s ears.</p>
<p>He looked at Erin, and saw how tense she was.</p>
<p>The speaker continued, “You’re scared and you’re scared with good reason. It’s going to get messy. People are going to die. People are going to deal with <em>worse</em> than death, because that’s where we’re at. That’s how it is in the worlds we dwell in. It’s inevitable.”</p>
<p>He remained where he was, lean muscular arms bristling with sun-bleached hair as he gripped the altar, letting that hang there.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna be okay,” he said, his eyes narrowing. “I memorized a passage. This king Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land.”</p>
<p>He pulled his hand away from the edge of the altar and struck it with his hand.</p>
<p>“You know what that says to me? It says you get in our way, you pick a fight with us? You’d best be prepared for the edge of our fucking swords. You’d best be prepared for us to take possession of your land. Do <em>not</em> get in our way, am I right!?”</p>
<p>There was a vocal response.</p>
<p>He raised his voice to be heard as he preached, “Cover your kids ears if you’re raising pussies, parents, but I’m going to say things that gotta be said, and if your kids haven’t heard this yet, you’re doing something wrong. This is the credo we live by. There are fuckers and there are the fucked, and we are fuckers of the highest order!”</p>
<p>Cheers. Bryce reacted, joining in. Erin started to move, to enter the church, and Rain stopped her. He glanced around to make sure nobody had seen.</p>
<p>“We are right and we are righteous!”</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>“We saw the end, we preached the end, and we <em>survived</em> the end!”</p>
<p>Some people stood from the pews, which forced others to stand if they wanted to see.</p>
<p>“They can shake and sweat and worry about winter and war, but we’re going to fucking <em>thrive</em>!”</p>
<p>Bryce stood on the pew, his high voice joining the crowd’s. He probably didn’t even understand.</p>
<p>Erin didn’t repeat her initial impulse of trying to go in, pulling her little brother away. Rain let his hand drop.</p>
<p>“We don’t get cold, we set our enemies on fire!”</p>
<p>Erin leaned close to Rain to be heard over the roars. “Can we go?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“If we get hungry, we raid, we pillage, and we’ll eat them alive!”</p>
<p>Cheers. The sound of the mob made Rain think of the mall, of Snag’s dream.</p>
<p>“None of that pussy skipping of the impolite parts. We go Old Testament on the asses of our enemies! Slaves, war, and disaster! We’ll go full Revelations with a rod of iron, and dash nations to pieces! Anyone who’s read that far knows, the end ain’t gonna be pretty, it ain’t going to be kind!”</p>
<p>Rain turned to go. He was aware that people were casting glances his way, that they were seeing him leave. It would be remarked on.</p>
<p>But he’d heard variations of this ‘sermon’ for all of his life. If pushed, he could probably write one.</p>
<p>For now, his focus was on Erin, as he saw how deeply unhappy she was, leaving her brother behind. He caught up with her, walked at her side.</p>
<p>She saw him looking at her, and said, “His behavior gets worse after they make him go to church.”</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make sense. It’s idiocy.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about sense. It’s about feeling like they have power.”</p>
<p>“They have it.”</p>
<p>“Some.”</p>
<p>She flinched at that, then looked over her shoulder. She slowed.</p>
<p>“I could go in there, drag him away. But they’d get upset with me, and it’s just…”</p>
<p>“You have to pick your battles,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I don’t get to pick any,” she said. “When do I get to pick a battle and get one I can win?”</p>
<p>He didn’t have an answer for her. The question echoed something he’d felt for some time.</p>
<p>He clenched his fist, feeling the frustration and anger boil up.</p>
<p>In the distance, in the background, he could hear the preacher raising his voice.</p>
<p>“This is the end and the ending has always belonged to us!” The acoustics of the church magnified the voice.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“We are the Fallen!”</p>
<p>The church shook with the furor of the crowd and Rain shook in what felt like equal measure, as he saw the hurt on his friend’s face and clenched his fists with a force that should have seen blood seeping between them, as it had in the room he’d dreamed of.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Thirty-five, forty people?”</p>
<p>“As a rough estimate,” Snag said. “But you’re not a soldier or a team player, from what I heard.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Beast of Burden recommended you as more of an assassin. Thirty five to sixty individuals with powers. Plus armed henchmen, drones, minions. We go to war, we do it with the sanction and assistance of the major names, and we intend to leave <em>no</em> room for any result except the one we need.”</p>
<p>“You want them wiped out?”</p>
<p>“Broken, scattered to the wind, if need be. But this one…”</p>
<p>The distorted image projected on the wall of the headquarters shifted. Snag pushed a piece of paper across the table.</p>
<p>“Seventeen years old, by our best guess. We don’t know his name, but we have an idea about his powers. Breaking things, primarily. Mover ability. Tinker ability. Emotion power. The last three are weak.”</p>
<p>“You’re asking me to kill someone young.”</p>
<p>“That hasn’t been a problem for you before.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Whatever happens in the chaos, whether they’re scattered, broken, arrested, killed, the result we want you to ensure is that this one doesn’t walk away.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense.”</p>
<p>“We could have reached out to someone else. We reached out to you. You should know why.”</p>
<p>“Because you want this kid to suffer.”</p>
<p>A rustling noise, muted.</p>
<p>It was Love Lost who handed the thin slip of paper over, her claws glinting.</p>
<p>The man at the table investigated the check.</p>
<p>“You really want this kid to suffer.”</p>
<p>“We want him to face a fate worse than death,” Snag said. “But we can’t have that and have him dead at the same time, and we need him dead. If he suffers as much as possible along the way to that conclusion, we’ll be satisfied.”</p>
<p>“If you’re paying, we can satisfy.”</p>
<p>“The check will clear.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll get that satisfaction you’re after.”</p>
<p>The conversation paused as something grabbed their attention.</p>
<p>“What in the fuck did you do to them?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Chris,” Sveta said. She gave Rain a worried look, and Rain flinched away from the compassion.</p>
<p>“Victoria’s in a fight,” Kenzie said. “I hope she’s okay.”</p>
<p>Rain pushed his hands through his hair, backing up.</p>
<p>“I hope we’re okay,” Kenzie said. “This is a bit much to deal with just us.”</p>
<p>It’s not to deal with you, Rain thought.</p>
<p>He could see the way Sveta was looking at him. Putting pieces together.</p>
<p>He couldn’t blame her. He was just now realizing what he was up against. For a year, he’d seen them at night. He’d seen them talk, getting everything in order.</p>
<p>For this. To destroy him.</p>
<p>Even hiding among the Fallen wouldn’t protect him. He’d clung to that reassurance and now it was gone.</p>
<p>He turned to go, grabbed his bag.</p>
<p>“Rain,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I gotta go,” Rain said. He collected more things. The key he’d been given. “You look after Victoria. Tell her thanks.”</p>
<p>“Don’t panic,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>How was he not supposed to panic?</p>
<p>“Thanks for everything, Tristan,” Rain said. “I’ll be in touch, but I gotta go. I can’t&mdash;”</p>
<p>He couldn’t. He wasn’t sure what to do. There was no answer. He had three people after him and they were stronger, more capable. He couldn’t do anything. He couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>Choking on the sentence he hadn’t finished, he hauled the door open, stepped out to the fire escape, and made his way down at a run, trusting his power to catch him if needed.</p>
<p>He ran until he couldn’t run anymore. He walked, feeling the full force of dread catch up with him as he slowed down. Then he ran again.</p>
<p>“Rain!”</p>
<p>Rain turned. With the panic firmly set in, his first instinct was fear. Even at a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Tristan. Tristan had run after him, and the guy barely looked winded.</p>
<p>“There you are,” Tristan said. “Oof. I turned down the wrong street back there.”</p>
<p>Rain was silent, except for his hard breaths. He felt like he was going to throw up.</p>
<p>“You can’t run. Don’t panic. Trust me, shitty things happen when you panic.”</p>
<p>“I’m dead,” Rain said. “I’m a dead man walking. Holy shit. They’re going to torture me to death.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got to tell people, Rain. You’ve got to tell Victoria, you’ve got to tell Sveta. Kenzie. Chris. Even Ashley&mdash; she won’t blink either way, but you should tell her.”</p>
<p>Rain shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised you didn’t already say,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I can’t. I can barely admit it to myself.”</p>
<p>“What were you going to do if Snag or Love Lost mentioned the Fallen while negotiating?”</p>
<p>“I don’t&mdash; wouldn’t it be easier?”</p>
<p>“Easier? Yes. Better? No. It’s best if it comes from your mouth first, Rain. The others think this is all lined up against us. But it isn’t. We’re just liable to get hit with the collateral damage.”</p>
<p>Rain wasn’t sure what to say or do. He shook his head.</p>
<p>“No? No what?”</p>
<p>“You tell them.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell them. I’ve been in situations like this before, trying to be an ally, ending up only hurting. Talk to them. Tell them. Write them a letter if you need to put the words in order. I’ll back you and argue on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“I heard that the Fallen attacked Victoria’s hometown. What if they hurt someone she cared about? What if she says she’ll only help the team if I’m not on it?”</p>
<p>“Do you think she would? I’m not so sure.”</p>
<p>“What if?” Rain asked, stressing the question. “They attacked people who were evacuating. There were groups that kidnapped people on the absolute worst day in history, raided them. What if it turns out they hurt people Kenzie cares about? Sveta&mdash; do you know what they say about people like Sveta? What I’ve said about people like Sveta?”</p>
<p>“I know what they’ve said about people like me,” Tristan said, setting his jaw. “What you’ve probably said about people like me.”</p>
<p>Rain flinched, breaking eye contact.</p>
<p>“Look at me, say it, and I’ll tell you it’s okay. Because you’re working on it. You’re better.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re really underestimating how little I want to face that side of me, that said those things. Or how little progress I’ve made from being a sack of shit.”</p>
<p>“Look me in the eye,” Tristan said. “Say something like, ‘hey Tristan, I used to be the kind of guy who’d call you a faggot or look down on you because you really like the dick.'”</p>
<p>“C’mon, man,” Rain said, cringing.</p>
<p>“Then you say you’re sorry, and I say it’s not a problem, I figured as much, and I reaffirm that you’re a friend. Really easy script. Then you say it to Sveta. We’ve talked about so much shit, we’ve worked through so much. You have to know we can be cool with this. All of us.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Rain said. “I get it. Fuck. But&mdash;”</p>
<p>He was interrupted as Tristan’s watch started beeping.</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“&mdash;But I don’t want you to be cool with it. I’m not cool with this,” Rain finished.</p>
<p>“I gotta change.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Look after Rain for me, Byron,” Tristan said, then blurred.</p>
<p>Byron wore a long-sleeved, slate-blue shirt with a snake on the front, and jeans.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?” Byron asked.</p>
<p>“Hide. Figure things out. Think.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Byron said. “I think all three of those things sound pretty reasonable.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell the others? Fill them in?”</p>
<p>“I think if Tristan is saying no, I should say no too. Especially when I’m not part of the group.”</p>
<p>Rain sighed.</p>
<p>“Go. Hide. Think. Spend time with that ridiculously awesome friend of yours,” Byron said.</p>
<p>Rain allowed himself a small smile.</p>
<p>“Maybe call Mrs. Yamada.”</p>
<p>“Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Seems like a big enough emergency to give her a call.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. It helped, knowing he could do that.</p>
<p>It helped, hearing Byron calmly lay things out, agree that it was right to get away and get safe. Tristan understood a lot of the other stuff, the fighting, the struggle, the&mdash; even trying to come back from being a scumbag. But Byron understood other things.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said, without even really realizing he’d intended to say it.</p>
<p>“You have allies,” Byron said. “Friends. Me included.”</p>
<p>“They have thirty-five to sixty people with powers, a hired assassin, and a grudge.”</p>
<p>“And we have a bit of time. We’ll use it.”</p>
<p>“We?”</p>
<p>“Fuck off,” Byron said, without smiling or even sounding like he was amused or annoyed. “You’re a friend. Of course I’m in this.”</p>
<p>Rain swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“Today was valuable. The team has a sense of what they’re up against. Mostly.”</p>
<p>“You think I should tell them,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Byron shrugged. He was Tristan’s inverse, in that he wasn’t one to push, even when he had strong feelings one way or the other.</p>
<p>“I’m going to hide out at the compound for a day or two. I, uh, I’ll think, and maybe I’ll explain when it’s time to come back. When there’s a clearer picture of what’s happening. Make sure they don’t do anything in the meantime?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Tristan heard too, and I think he’d agree.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to hide, you should go before they wrap up that meeting and decide to catch a train heading in the same direction you’re going.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded, swallowing hard again.</p>
<p>He turned to go. Not running, this time, but walking as fast as he could.</p>
<p>To seek sanctuary amid monsters.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap38">Shade &mdash; 4.4</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>I was being watched.</p>
<p>I was being watched at a time when Rain was gone, hiding, when Tattletale was in play. We had enemies, I’d drawn attention. These things, though, weren’t at the forefront of my attention. It said a lot that they weren’t.</p>
<p>The slash on Moose’s face lingered in my mind’s eye, when I wasn’t careful about where that eye was turned.</p>
<p>The train was noisy as it rolled along the tracks. With the longer train journeys, I was primed to expect that the urban would give way to the rural or the buildings on either side would <em>stop</em>. It didn’t. Like a car driving down the highway at night, the streetlights reaching into the vehicle interior and then dropping away, the sun’s light did much the same when it reached in at a low angle, extending between buildings to light up the dark train car.</p>
<p>It was just late enough in the morning that most students had made their way to school, but the students with classes in the afternoon block that had stopped in to check in or change were now leaving the schools. They were heading off to work, to do light construction work, for academic clubs, study halls and to join the patrol block, and many were dressed accordingly. They looked so young.</p>
<p>The train car was packed, and I was glad I’d managed to get a seat, even though it was one of the narrow, tiny ones by the door that flipped up to be flush with the wall, when a wheelchair or baby carriage needed the room.</p>
<p>I’d first noticed the person watching me because her face had a lot of freckles, and out of the corner of my eye, I’d thought she was someone else. On closer look, though, I could see that her hair was jaw length and straighter, her facial structure was different, and she was wearing the clothes of a student athlete, with bare shoulders and arms, gym shorts, and a towel around her neck.</p>
<p>I might have dismissed her then, but she’d been looking at me, looking away when I glanced her way. I found myself looking again a few moments later, because one look wasn’t enough to dismiss the unease I felt in response to a freckle-covered face looming in my peripheral vision, peering past the crowd. The same thing happened the second time I looked at her. I caught her staring, and she looked away.</p>
<p>There had been a time that I would have automatically assumed it was positive. I was recognizable, I’d been a hometown celebrity in a town with a fair number of prominent people, and that had led to me getting recognized by at least one person each time I went out. I’d reveled in it.</p>
<p>Now? Traitorous instincts made that the second or even the third rank option in a list. The first thought in my head on realizing I was being stared at was to go straight to the hospital room, to people staring at wretched me in a vain effort to try to comprehend what they were looking at. They wondered how I even functioned, how I worked, tried to understand the configuration. When I moved automatically, the movements caught the eye.</p>
<p>Even with the most polite and iron-willed of them, they struggled to find which eye or eyes they should look at to make and maintain eye contact, and in the search for that common, natural thing, they ended up staring at the rest of me.</p>
<p>At the rest of the wretch, the sideshow freak, the monster.</p>
<p>How had Byron put it, at the meeting with Foresight? Tristan was nourished by the hardheaded struggle. Byron was recharged by periods of rest. It gave Tristan a natural advantage in their endless struggle over a single body.</p>
<p>I was closer to Byron in that. I was recharged by attention, by adulation, encouragement, worship. It was a natural progression of the fact that I’d been built to be a hero, because I could put on a costume and do great things and get that attention and encouragement.</p>
<p>Had I done things in a different way, it could have even been constructive and healthy. But I’d been a stupid kid. Arrogant. A little worship was good. I’d worshiped Dean. He’d worshiped me. On a level, I’d reached for the wrong things in places, prioritized certain things over others in how I handled the adulation and the public. There were a lot of things I wished I’d done differently.</p>
<p>That wasn’t even the biggest part of why, much like Byron, I couldn’t go to my most natural ways of finding recharge. Like how mental illness obscured the ability of the person in question to even see the problem at hand, my capacity to recover was distorted and damaged. Tainted.</p>
<p>Tristan had remarked on it too, now that I thought about it. Needing <em>people</em>. He wanted to party, to abandon restraint. I wanted… I supposed I wanted not to illogically, automatically, <em>inevitably</em> think of the wretched <em>thing</em> that had occupied that hospital room, anytime someone paid particular attention to me.</p>
<p>I wanted to not feel a deep sadness sinking in when I caught someone staring.</p>
<p>In the places my head went, the wretch loomed in first place, the hero celebrity in second. The third place possibility was that this girl looking at me was something nefarious, and that the young, freckle-faced athlete was an agent of Tattletale or a hire from Cedar Point. Not impossible, but not likely.</p>
<p>Then the fourth place possibility, that she thought I was attractive, not impossible. The fifth place possibility that I had a piece of my breakfast stuck to my cheek or something in my hair. The sixth place possibility, that she was staring off into space and I was somehow always in the way…</p>
<p>My thoughts were mired in something so minor, my heart ached indistinctly, and I was just making myself anxious and upset.</p>
<p>I checked my phone. I could focus on the job. The mission at hand.</p>

I know I said I wouldn’t send you any more messages but I forgot I had these scans on my phone:<br>
[Attachment: costumedoodlewoo_1.i &mdash; Touch to open in a new window]</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>[You have 39 more unread emails. Touch to continue reading]</strong></p>
<p>If they’d been texts I would have been alerted with each one, but I hadn’t, and they’d accumulated. I was prepared to continue browsing, wrapping my head around reading through the emails in reverse order, but the train slowed, brakes squealing.</p>
<p>The signs above the exits changed. <em>Car 3: Blackrock Station.</em></p>
<p>Students departed, then more entered, but the end result was that things were far less crowded. I got a look at the girl who was staring at me, and she glanced away, reflexively.</p>
<p>As people exited, seats here and there were freed up. There was a bit of a shuffle as people hurried to claim seats. A sixteen-ish year old boy claimed the vacated seat next to me.</p>
<p>In that same moment, though, Ashley moved between train cars, entering mine, spotted me, and approached. She wore sunglasses and the black dress she’d picked up at Cedar Point. Strapless, with sheer black fabric enveloping the shoulders and arms, decorated with a lace-like pattern of feathers. The sleeves disappeared into fingerless black gloves. Her little black shoes looked like dancer’s shoes, which fit with the dress she wore.</p>
<p>I raised my hand in a little wave.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d be around,” she said, lifting her sunglasses.</p>
<p>“I messaged you when I boarded,” I said, touching my phone. I saw her expression change. “And you don’t like phones.”</p>
<p>The seat I was sitting in was positioned such that the backs of the actual booth seats were to me. Ashley leaned against the back of one of the other seats, facing me, and the boy just beside me lifted his bag from his lap and used the room she’d given him to vacate the seat.</p>
<p>“Do you want my seat?” I asked him.</p>
<p>He glanced back, looked at me, looked at Ashley, then shook his head. He nearly lost his balance as the train resumed moving.</p>
<p>Ashley took the seat, pulling it down from the side of the train and then sitting on it, crossing one knee over the other and placing her hands on top. Posed, in a very deliberate, conscious way. Even the angle of her head.</p>
<p>I looked past her to the freckled observer, who again looked away. Was it my frame of mind, sitting with Ashley, that made it so the wretch wasn’t as close to the surface, the look not nearly as bothersome?</p>
<p>Or was I overthinking it? Was it that I’d seen the look enough times and seen her reaction enough times that it didn’t feel so heavy, pressing, or potentially hostile? Less about me and more about her, now.</p>
<p>“He’s sensible,” Ashley said. “He’ll go far.”</p>
<p>She might have thought I was looking at the boy who’d run.</p>
<p>“Did you take off your sunglasses just to intimidate him into giving up his seat?” I asked.</p>
<p>She put her sunglasses back into place and gave me a small smile.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t,” I said.</p>
<p>“Why not? If there was a chance I’d see him again, maybe I shouldn’t, but I won’t. The city is too big.”</p>
<p>“The little things ripple out. If you make a positive or negative impression, people mention them to others, those people mention them or carry them forward. You’re not just interacting with him. You’re interacting with everyone he’s potentially going to interact with in the future. To lesser degrees, sure, but I absolutely think it matters.”</p>
<p>“What’s he going to say? I didn’t do anything, and he willingly gave up his seat. Is he going to tell all of his friends and family that he saw a lady with scary eyes and he ran away like a stray with its tail between its legs?”</p>
<p>“I think it matters,” I said.</p>
<p>“I wanted to learn from you all. I’ll have to take that sentiment and think on it&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said.</p>
<p>“&mdash;because you’ve only given me sentiment. Not one good argument yet.”</p>
<p>I turned my head her way, frowning. She smiled a little more.</p>
<p>“Let’s say you entered the scene, you’ve gathered all your info, you have a nice costume, you’ve trained, you’re badass,” I said.</p>
<p>“Mm,” she made a sound.</p>
<p>“You have your first big job. You make a splash, there’s some media attention, video, something like that. It appears on TV briefly, but people talk online. They’re the ones who create your online profile and fill in your info, they apply the labels, describe things, set the tone. What if the guy you scared off ends up being one of them, and he ends up sitting at his keyboard, remembering you as he decides what to write?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do a thing to him.”</p>
<p>“But did he leave with a good impression of you?”</p>
<p>She shrugged.</p>
<p>“What happens if this guy finds himself in that situation, ready to make a call about you or share his thoughts, and he describes his horrible encounter with you on the train, how you intimidated him and said odious things?”</p>
<p>“I said nothing.”</p>
<p>“And he’s a teenager, he’s a guy, you’re a girl, he’ll think about this scene again, he might be bothered, and he’ll want to resolve that feeling. Maybe he lies and badmouths you online.”</p>
<p>Ashley looked like she was the very definition of unimpressed.</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>“I hate the internet,” she said. “Despise it. When I become a villain, I’ll move out to a border world where the internet isn’t established and I’ll take over. I’ll rule as a queen, without any need to concern myself with teenagers who could lie about me without fear of reprisal.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a plan,” I said. It was my turn to shoot her a small smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” she said. She brought her head back, leaning it against the wall behind her. “I’ve been brought low, relying on sentiment over fact. How the tables have turned.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t actually what I was thinking,” I said.</p>
<p>I didn’t get a chance to elaborate. The girl with freckles approached. She looked spooked, arms close to her body as she held a notebook, but the ‘spook’ was aimed more at me.</p>
<p>Too petite to be the person I’d worried I’d seen out of the corner of my eye, earlier. Years younger &mdash; fourteen, if I had to guess. Timid, yes, fidgety, that was similar, but in other ways, she held herself differently. This girl dressed different, sporty and confident.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I said.</p>
<p>“Are you&mdash; you’re Victoria Dallon.”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“I’m a fan. I’ve been a fan for years.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Presley.”</p>
<p>“You know, Presley, I was just thinking about how I missed the days of living in Brockton Bay, when I’d get to make connections with people. I missed that, and you might have just made my day.”</p>
<p>Her smile was tentative at first and then solidified into something more confident.</p>
<p>“I lived in Brockton Bay for a year when I was nine. My family was going through stuff. That doesn’t really matter but it’s why I was there, and I saw this picture of you and I loved it. I didn’t even know you were a real person or what your name was until a month later. I got a poster of the same picture for my birthday.”</p>
<p>“Which poster?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it had a yellow background, and you were flying, and you had your arms out and behind you, like&mdash;”</p>
<p>She took a bit of a pose, chest pushed up and out, arms back with fists clenched near her butt. Well, one fist. She held the notebook, still.</p>
<p>“I know the one,” I said. “That was a magazine cover first, I think.”</p>
<p>“I have the magazine too. And a bunch of other things. Even after I moved to Portland I did everything I could to collect each thing that came out. But the poster was important to me.”</p>
<p>“I’m really glad,” I said.</p>
<p>“It was one of the first things I put on my wall every time we settled into a new place. Later, whenever I was feeling lost I’d look at it. I got into sports because I read you were an athlete before you were a hero, except it’s soccer, not basketball, because I’m too short.”</p>
<p>She looked disappointed as she said it.</p>
<p>“You’re in the athletics block,” I said. “They don’t let just anyone in. I’d bet you’re better at soccer than I was at basketball.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said, with an expression like that was impossible to fathom, even upsetting, eyes wide.</p>
<p>It seemed she needed me as an idol more than she needed me as a connection or someone she could relate to.</p>
<p>“I got a lot of extra flack and attention from the enemy team because I came from a family of heroes and a lot of people knew my name,” I said. “Maybe that was why.”</p>
<p>Presley nodded very quickly. “There’s someone on my team who’s really good, she gets something like that. I really look up to her too.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep hugging that notebook or are you going to hand it over for her to sign?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>Presley looked startled at that, afraid. She’d been working her way up to it, and the issue had been forced.</p>
<p>“Be nice,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m being nice,” Ashley responded. “The way this is going, this girl&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Her name is Presley,” I interjected.</p>
<p>“She’s going to finish telling you how awesome you are, she won’t work up the nerve, and she’ll kick herself for not getting the autograph.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes slightly and turned to Presley. “Do you want me to?”</p>
<p>“Please,” she breathed the word more than she said it.</p>
<p>I took the notebook and I took the pen. It had been a little while since I’d done this.</p>
<p>“When I looked at you in the poster I told myself that was everything I wanted to be, fearless and fair and strong and poised. Every time I entered a new part of my life or moved to a new place, I looked at it in different ways.”</p>
<p>I wrote my message on the inside cover, listening while the pen scratched.</p>
<p>“When we had to evacuate because of Gold Morning, we had to leave everything behind.”</p>
<p>I looked up. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“But we went back, after everything calmed down. We went back to the house and it was mostly intact, except for broken windows and water damage. We could only bring what we could fit in the car, but I made sure to bring that. I wanted it with me for whatever comes next.”</p>
<p>“I can only encourage and inspire, and I’m really glad if I’ve helped with that. The strength, the fairness, the poise, though, that comes from you. Everything you’ve triumphed over, surviving the bad days, getting to here, then doing well enough to be part of the athletics block,” I said. I closed the book, the pen still between the pages. I passed it to her, and put my hands over hers as she took the book. I met her eyes. “That’s you. That’s your power. Pretty much what I wrote, but I wanted to say it too.”</p>
<p>As I moved my hands away from hers, she smiled and hugged the book.</p>
<p>A moment later, she turned to Ashley. She lowered her voice, “Do you have powers?”</p>
<p>Ashley nodded.</p>
<p>“Can you?” Presley held out the notebook.</p>
<p>“No,” Ashley replied.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m sorry,” Presley said, too quickly, too defensive in how she pulled her book back, how she held it. She looked at me. “Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome,” I said.</p>
<p>But as I said it, Presley was already retreating, fleeing back to her spot by the doors, amid all the other students who were standing in the seatless area that would have bikes and prams in it at different stages of the journey.</p>
<p>I could have pressed, even taken issue with how Ashley had handled that.</p>
<p>Instead, I gathered my thoughts. On a level, I did feel refreshed. It had been a really nice moment, the minor issue at the end souring it slightly, but nice all the same.</p>
<p>I was having to get used to having the nice moments be routinely touched with those sour notes.</p>
<p>“I can’t hold a pen,” Ashley murmured.</p>
<p>I looked at her.</p>
<p>She moved her hands from where they rested on her knee. She turned one over, moved a finger. It trembled throughout the small movement. “I’ll have my appointment after we talk to Houndstooth, get tuned up. Until then, it hurts to move my hands and I don’t trust my power. That’s why.”</p>
<p>“You could have explained.”</p>
<p>She gave me a look.</p>
<p>“You could have,” I said.</p>
<p>The look was maintained. Even with the sunglasses she wore, the disdain was clear. “Ripple effects, you said. I wouldn’t be revealing it to her alone. I’d be risking revealing it to everyone she meets from here on out.”</p>
<p>“The good things have a way of rippling out with more strength than the bad things do,” I said.</p>
<p>“So you say,” Ashley said, “while riding on a train through a city in the post-apocalypse. Just one of many shattered, damaged worlds.”</p>
<p>“Cute.”</p>
<p>The train slowed. Presley was at the door, joining the group that was ready to depart.</p>
<p>“I’d like to tell her,” I said, my voice quiet. “Even if we called it an injury, so you weren’t revealing something vital.”</p>
<p>“You really care about this.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I care,” she said. “I don’t want to lie and look weak while you lie to look better.”</p>
<p>I tensed.</p>
<p>“You’re strong, yes,” she said, her voice barely audible. She took off her sunglasses. “Poised? I think it’s an act. An effective act, the kind that becomes reality after enough time. But not enough time has passed. Fair? We’ll see. But fearless?”</p>
<p>She made the smallest of scoffing sounds. The train came to a stop.</p>
<p>I started to respond, but there was a hollow feeling in my mouth and throat, where the words were supposed to be. I closed my mouth, then said, just as quiet, “She needs that lie.”</p>
<p>Ashley stared me down.</p>
<p>“Frankly,” I said, still quiet, angry now, “you come across worse and smaller as a person when you say no to something that costs you nothing than you do by admitting you’re disabled.”</p>
<p>“Temporarily disabled,” she said. “You’re wrong. I can’t think of anything worse than groveling before a <em>child</em> and telling her I’m weak when I’m the very opposite. I could kill everyone on this train if it came down to it. One after the other. By the time I made my way to the next train car, they would be ready for me, and it wouldn’t matter.”</p>
<p>I tensed as heads turned. They weren’t responding to the words. Only the emotion behind them.</p>
<p>Had I just provoked her into another rage on a relatively crowded train?</p>
<p>Would my next words? Would my silence? Would leaving? Staying?</p>
<p>“She doesn’t know that it’s only temporary,” I said. “She just thinks there’s something wrong. With you or with her.”</p>
<p>“Let her,” Ashley said. “Do what you want, but don’t make me regret telling you anything.”</p>
<p>I looked over to the side. The people had departed the train, Presley included, and the ones boarding had mostly filed in.</p>
<p>“It’s too late anyway,” Ashley said. “Another face we’ll never see again, that probably won’t make any ripples.”</p>
<p>I stood from my seat. “I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.”</p>
<p>Glancing back, making sure she wasn’t about to go on a rampage as she had threatened, I ducked and pushed past the crowd, hurrying to the door. Tristan touched my shoulder as I passed him.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back. Can you watch my bag?” I said, turning to face him and walking backward as I said it. I pointed in Ashley’s direction and mouthed ‘and Ashley’.</p>
<p>He gave me a short nod.</p>
<p>The doors closed behind me as I stepped onto the train platform. I took to the air.</p>
<p>Why was this so important to me?</p>
<p>With a bird’s eye view, I could search the crowd, looking for the right hair color, the right height, the clothes, freckle-covered shoulders, chin-length hair.</p>
<p>Was this ego?</p>
<p>Was I just seeking out perverse, self-centered worship, after going without so long? Tantalus finally getting a drink of water after centuries without? A parasitic, sad wretch of a vampire like in those bad Maggie Holt movies, finally with a willing victim?</p>
<p>I’d found her and I hesitated.</p>
<p>But the train was getting away from me. I had to act.</p>
<p>Instinct, rather than action. I wasn’t thinking things through. I wasn’t acting according to the mission I’d planned and set out, was I?</p>
<p>I landed, forward momentum becoming a brisk walk, then a slower one. I saw the surprise on her face. People nearby were startled.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” I said. “I’m in a rush. I don’t suppose I could get your email?”</p>
<p>She looked around, possibly looking for Ashley, or at the crowd.</p>
<p>She still held her notebook, and she opened it, scribbling something down. She tore off the corner of the page, then handed it to me.</p>
<p>“I’ll send you something,” I said.</p>
<p>She nodded, wordless.</p>
<p>I left the ground much as I’d landed. The train was already pulling away. I flew after it.</p>
<p>Had I made a mistake, leaving Ashley, when she was riled up? I had no idea how well she and Tristan got along. Were my perspectives straight?</p>
<p>It wasn’t even nine o’clock in the morning, and I was mired in a week’s worth of doubts and second-guesses. That wasn’t <em>me.</em> It wasn’t supposed to be.</p>
<p>I checked my phone as I flew.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>You have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">52</span> unread emails</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I’d had thirty nine or forty, after browsing the initial selection.</p>
<p>I was here for a reason. Kenzie was one. Ashley another. Tristan, Chris, even Sveta… and Rain in particular. Rain who was taking a day off from everything.</p>
<p>They needed help. That was the job, the mission. Given to me by someone I cared about, involving another someone I cared about and the team and place in the world she so desperately wanted.</p>
<p>I could do that. But I didn’t want to do it at the expense of people like Presley.</p>
<p>The feelings and the ideas took on a different light when I framed things that way.</p>
<p>It played into how I carried myself, after I touched down on the back of the train, on the same kind of little platform at the rear that Rain had used to jump off.</p>
<p>It played into how I walked, how I organized my thoughts.</p>
<p>I could remember going home after my first official arrest. Bad guy beaten, caught, delivered to authorities. Everything official, with my mom attending. I’d walked in the door, and my mother had told my dad that I’d had two firsts. My first arrest, my first war wound&mdash; a cut to my forehead, already stitched up. She’d used her fingers to move my hair, to show my dad.</p>
<p>He’d looked very tired as he bent down, kissed the top of my head.</p>
<p>He’d offered me cookies and milk and I’d rolled my eyes, even though I’d really wanted the cookies.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure at all about why or if the cookies played into things, but I did remember how I’d stood straighter, how I’d felt taller, more focused.</p>
<p>That was the feeling I wanted to capture, as I walked down the train car, entered the next, walked down <em>that</em> train car, and then entered the car I’d been in before going after my fan.</p>
<p>Tristan was in my seat, talking to Ashley. Ashley was tense. She didn’t look as if she’d calmed down in my absence.</p>
<p>Tristan wore a black jacket over a red t-shirt in a material that looked like it was meant to have sweat wick off of it. He’d painted his hair again and the color reached to the roots.</p>
<p>He moved over from the seat as I approached, leaving the one between him and Ashley empty. Ashley didn’t move, her eyes hidden by the sunglasses she wore. A thin beam of light swept through the length of the train car. Not as pronounced an effect as it had been earlier, with the train slightly lower to the ground, the train at a different angle.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to believe you’re more deluded than the rest of us,” Ashley said, as I took the seat. “Thinking any of that matters.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I said. I fiddled with my phone, typing in the email.</p>
<p>“Did you tell her?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I got her email, and I flew after the train. Hi Tristan.”</p>
<p>“From what I gather, you have a fan, and you and Ashley had a disagreement,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, still typing. “Any word on Rain?”</p>
<p>“Scared as shit but safe.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “Is he going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“No idea. But if they go after him, we’re not in a position to do anything. I’d like to ask Houndstooth for advice, see what resources we can tap.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>I paged through the phone, the email entered, and found myself at the home screen for the mail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>You have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">55</span> unread emails</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I checked nobody was in earshot. There were people in the chairs just beside Tristan’s seat, but they had headphones on. I figured we were pretty safe.</p>
<p>“Kenzie might be melting down,” I said. “Or something. I don’t know how to interpret this.”</p>
<p>I showed Ashley. I went to show Tristan, and he was already pulling his phone out of his pocket.</p>
<p>He showed me his.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>26 unread emails</em></span></p>
<p>“She likes you more,” he said.</p>
<p>“I told her I don’t use my phone. She was bothered at first, but she accepted it,” Ashley said. “Now I’m glad.”</p>
<p>“What is this?” I asked. “There’s a part of me that’s weirdly glad for the stream-of-consciousness insight into who she is and how she thinks, even if this isn’t good, but… this isn’t good. It’s not healthy.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t,” Tristan said. “But it could be worse. If anything, it’s a good prelude or warm-up for our discussion with Houndstooth. We’ll talk with him, we’ll send Kenzie a message, if she hasn’t had her phone confiscated, and we’ll see how things go from there.”</p>
<p>“If you’re sure.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure of anything,” he said. “But we all have our weaknesses, and Kenzie’s wrestling with hers. We’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I took my seat between the two. “Can I ask you two a favor?”</p>
<p>“What favor?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Ashley asked. “I made the mistake of going along with an errand with the two most stubborn people I know. I deserve whatever I’m subjected to.”</p>
<p>“Could be we’re the two most stubborn members of the group,” I said. I found myself reaching for that part of me that stood taller, that focused on the mission and the role. “But we’re the <em>three</em> most style-conscious people in this whole exercise. We might be missing Kenzie in that. Three of the four most style conscious.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say Kenzie’s style-conscious,” Tristan said. “But that’s a conversation for another day. What’s this about style?”</p>
<p>“I want to take a picture. Lean in close,” I said. “Please.”</p>
<p>Ashley gave me a look.</p>
<p>“Please,” I said. “And since you don’t have masks, you can use my hand, Ashley. Tristan, cover up a bit with your hand. Look photogenic.”</p>
<p>“I’ve only had my photo taken twice,” Ashley said. “They were basically mugshots.”</p>
<p>“Did you look good for the mugshots?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Then look good for this. Come on. This could be your equivalent to a poster. She thought you were cool enough to ask for an autograph, let’s give her a good picture.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>The two leaned in close, my hand in front of Ashley’s eyes, fingers parted in the middle to reveal one of her eyes. Tristan used one hand, positioning himself so his hair wouldn’t be in the camera’s frame.</p>
<p>I winked and hit the button to take the picture.</p>
<p>“None of this matters,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>I applied a caption to the picture.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thanks for coming and saying hi. Picture <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just for you</span>&mdash; keep an eye out for us in the future.</em></p>
<p>I showed the others the picture and caption. I got an okay from both, and sent it.</p>
<p>I held the phone where everyone could see it. With the first excited response, half of Ashley’s tension seemed to dissipate. With the second and third, she smiled.</p>
<p>Doing this, helping, functioning in my role, I felt less like a vampire. Less like I was serving myself, because the feelings were set aside to where they were secondary.</p>
<p>It felt like a good warrior monk frame of mind for my discussion with Houndstooth.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>We had to walk a little ways to get to where Houndstooth waited. He was in costume, and his appearance at the station would have risked a disruption.</p>
<p>All through the short walk across Greenwich, there were signs of the protests and strikes. Crude posters had been put up, with slogans and rallies to the cause.</p>
<p>It was too early in the day for a real protest, though. Just groups on street corners, some scattered people making a mess and some cleaning up. Stasis.</p>
<p>Houndstooth waited on a hill overlooking the city sprawl. He looked as he had in Kenzie’s projected image. Anubis writ Western, with a shorter, blunter snout and a costume of mixed panels that straddled the line between being a bodysuit and being armor.</p>
<p>“Thank you for making the time,” Tristan said. He shook Houndstooth’s hand.</p>
<p>“It was my request,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I said, as he shook my hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, Victoria.”</p>
<p>He turned to Ashley. She stood with her hands clasped behind her.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you as well,” he said, taking the lack of a handshake in stride.</p>
<p>The conversation hung there.</p>
<p>“This is hard,” he said.</p>
<p>“We appreciate you helping out with Cedar Point,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We can open by talking about that,” Houndstooth said. “You’ve visited?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Two of us. One of us more covert.”</p>
<p>His snout moved more in Ashley’s direction, then he nodded. “How bad is it, once you’re there?”</p>
<p>I answered, “Protection racket in full swing. Villains moved in en masse. People moved away when they could. Those that couldn’t are paralyzed now, helping to maintain the very thin veneer of normalcy while paying what little they can to the villains in control. Prancer and Velvet are some of the most prominent drug distributors right now and they’re in charge, so it’s likely serving as a hub for that.”</p>
<p>“Some very violent capes are active there,” Tristan said. “A few of them we have a tenuous relationship with seem to be gathering soldiers with an intent to go to war. It <em>looks</em> like that might include us, but we don’t know one hundred percent what they’re up to.”</p>
<p>“As expected, then,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>Ashley said, “They have rooms to rent, but they cornered that market. They’re welcoming newcomers, but only capes, only ones who will help them out. The businesses are struggling or closed, and nobody outside of Cedar Point is moronic enough to buy in. Cancer at the roots, the tree will die.”</p>
<p>Houndstooth said, “I remember back on Bet, we had a system we used for the areas where the good guys couldn’t win, or where things were too bad to recover. It was mostly small towns. Evacuating, shutting off all power and water from the outside, closing down and blockading the roads, making living there as difficult as possible, perimeter blockades, regular raids, visits from big name capes. There was serious consideration given to giving Brockton Bay that H.O.S.V. designation.”</p>
<p>I had to assume his attention was on me as he said that last bit.</p>
<p>“They said no in the end,” I said.</p>
<p>“What’s your feeling on that?”</p>
<p>“I think I would have made peace with it if they’d said yes,” I said. “It wouldn’t be what it is now.”</p>
<p>“It’s a pretty mixed thing right now.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I said. “I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer. As it is, it has its positives, it’s meant a lot to some people that it recovered as much as it did, it was a <em>huge</em> part of us rebuilding after the end. But I’m not at peace with it either.”</p>
<p>“What happens to Cedar Point in the end, then?”</p>
<p>“We weaken their hold, we leave room for more established parties to settle in and act as a counterbalance, instead of things all going the wrong way. You mentioned Brockton Bay. We saw what happened when the scale tipped too far one way. Too many heroes out of the picture, myself included, not enough coming in.”</p>
<p>“If we uncover anything particularly bad, and we might have already found something bad, we’ll strike at them as we make our big play,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>Tristan and I looked at her.</p>
<p>She added, “With the help of other groups and forces.”</p>
<p>“We can be one of those other forces,” Houndstooth said. “Kings of the Hill aren’t big or strong, but we’ve got our territory and we’re helping to keep the peace. In exchange, we could use help when it comes to tackling some of the other problems. Ideally, it would be you three. Not…”</p>
<p>“Kenzie?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“I’d prefer to say kids,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to get around to talking about her,” Ashley said. “You can’t dodge the subject forever. I’ll get irritated and walk away if you try.”</p>
<p>He folded his arms, walking over a little. The hill had several trees on it, and his armor panels glinted here and there as dappled light touched it.</p>
<p>“You said this was hard,” I said.</p>
<p>“Did she touch any of you before you came here?” Houndstooth asked.</p>
<p>“She went to school this morning. We came here,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I suspected that would be the way it went. It’s why I wanted to meet when she was in school. Minimizes the chances.”</p>
<p>“Why does it matter?” I asked. “We’re bugged?”</p>
<p>“Trackers, cameras, microphones, or&mdash;” he paused, and his mask meant that if he was making an expression or trying to convey something with the pause, it was more or less lost. “&mdash;Sound cameras.”</p>
<p>“She’s a lot better than she was when you knew her,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“That’s great,” Houndstooth said. “I really do want things to work out for her. It’s just hard. I need to protect myself, my old teammates. I want to protect you. I want people in general to be safe. All that aside, again, I do want positive outcomes for her.”</p>
<p>“But?” I asked.</p>
<p>“But the Kenzie I know didn’t allow for that,” Houndstooth said. “So I had to prepare for this meeting, trying to figure out what to say and how to frame things while not hurting anyone.”</p>
<p>“She’s been in therapy for a little while,” Tristan said. “She’s improved by leaps and bounds from even the first time I met her. I really want to reinforce that.”</p>
<p>“I hear you,” Houndstooth said. “I’m just worried you’re not going to listen, and if that’s the case, then it’s a bad replay of me, our Protectorate leader and our PRT liaison talking to her school. It’s a replay of us having a meeting with her new foster parents. It’s a repeat of us talking to the parents of a new friend she’s made.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We explained, they heard us, but they didn’t listen. They didn’t take it to heart, because she is&mdash; was nine. She’s cute, she’s precocious, and she has a really skewed skillset where she’s really good at getting close to people and she’s really, tragically bad at staying there. Messes follow.”</p>
<p>“She’s moving in a more measured way as she relates to the people around her now,” Tristan said. “She’s more easygoing. And so far, staying close? She’s doing okay. Fingers crossed.”</p>
<p>Houndstooth’s hand moved, thumb tapping against the side of his finger, and it looked like he was going to say something.</p>
<p>“Capricorn, was it?”</p>
<p>“Or Tristan.”</p>
<p>“Tristan. I hear you. I’m listening. She’s in therapy, she’s better. She’s made strides. If you had to give her a number, how much better is she? Throw a number at me. Eighty percent?”</p>
<p>“Ninety five,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Ninety,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Houndstooth said. “Five or ten percent of what I saw? Still pretty <em>fucking</em> bad. I’d like to give you some advice and double check some things. As the person who’s been there and crossed his fingers before.”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair, you’re&mdash;” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Tristan,” I said, cutting him off.</p>
<p>I was focused on Houndstooth. I was pretty sure I’d beaten him by a hair in responding.</p>
<p>“I asked you to have this chat as my side of our mutual agreement,” Houndstooth said. “I’m asking you to let me convey this to you. A lot of it is pretty mild. Give me a chance to say my piece, and you decide what to do with the knowledge.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Tristan.</p>
<p>“I’ll shut up,” he said. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to listen,” Ashley said. “Then I’ll say my piece.”</p>
<p>She had a piece to say? I hadn’t known this when she’d invited herself along as one of the group’s ‘leaders’.</p>
<p>“Please,” I said, to Houndstooth.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you some of the same advice my bosses gave to us and the people who interacted with Kenzie. Minimize the homework she does. That includes work-homework. Cape homework, if you want to call it that.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because she’s so eager to please she’ll hurt herself in the process. She had an art project in fourth grade, it was supposed to be done over the course of a month, following the instructions from regular handouts the teacher gave. Eight or ten handouts, I think it was. She asked kids a grade older than her what they’d done for the same project, and she pulled two consecutive all-nighters to do it. Her foster parents didn’t even realize she was doing it, because it turns out a surveillance-countersurveillance tinker is really good at sneaking out to the garage and being quiet.”</p>
<p>“Surveillance-countersurveillance,” I said.</p>
<p>“She went that far because she wanted to wow her teacher and see the expressions on their face,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t good,” Tristan said. “Their reactions.”</p>
<p>“Shocked, almost horrified,” Houndstooth said. “And Kenzie was devastated to the point of being broken when it didn’t get the reaction she wanted it to. She was so stressed out over it in the days after that that she threw up in class, which&mdash; it didn’t win points with her classmates, and it led to her being transferred to another class. Devastating on both fronts, because she had classmates she liked and she loved her teacher.”</p>
<p>“How do you get ahead of that?” I asked. “What do you do to balance it?”</p>
<p>“Treat it like a full-time job?” Houndstooth asked. “Preventative measures, like the ones I’m recommending. She’ll go the extra mile unless you set up a roadblock to disallow that progress. So you have to stay ahead of that. She’s a headache in that.”</p>
<p>“She mentioned she has a slip for study hall that gets her out of homework. It sounds like they’re letting her use it,” I said.</p>
<p>“Great. I’m glad that’s there. It goes beyond just school. She’s working on this job of yours at Cedar Point?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“What limits did you set on that? On her schedule?”</p>
<p>“She needs to do her schoolwork, she doesn’t let it impact her grades or attendance. Standard rules of conduct for Wards, carried forward.”</p>
<p>“That’s one step, but it’s not enough. She’s ninety-five percent better? That five percent says she’s losing sleep, sitting in her bedroom or bunk in the dark, checking cameras and feeds or searching old footage. She’ll work herself to the bone trying to uncover that gem that she can turn in to earn your affection.”</p>
<p>I looked at Tristan, then Ashley.</p>
<p>I looked at Houndstooth. “You think this is likely? Even with her doing better?”</p>
<p>“I would bet you real money. And I’d be thrilled to, because my team is in a bad spot for funding, and it’d help.”</p>
<p>“Fuck,” Tristan said. “We can narrow the window, set time restrictions.”</p>
<p>“Or we have her keep the majority of the tinker stuff at our place,” I said.</p>
<p>“Do both,” Houndstooth said. “She’ll be working on other projects, possibly surprise projects, very similar to her art project in intent and execution.”</p>
<p>“She’s working on some side projects,” I said. “The eye camera. A teleporter.”</p>
<p>“You do realize she doesn’t build teleporters, right?” Houndstooth asked.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t lie,” Ashley said, stern. “Don’t imply she does.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t implying,” Houndstooth said. His voice softened, “I framed that wrong. I think she <em>can</em> build Teleporters. But she doesn’t. For the same reason she doesn’t build guns, mechs, A.I., chemicals, bio-stuff. She <em>can</em> do that stuff, but she’ll make half a percent of progress in the time it takes her to complete a whole project in her skillset. She’ll spend hundreds of dollars in materials to get that half a percent.”</p>
<p>“And the way you describe this&mdash;” I started. “She’ll actually, genuinely try to complete the teleporter project, even at a glacial pace, at a massive cost to her well-being?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Houndstooth said. “At least as far as I understand it. She’ll try to finish the project, she’ll believe it and make others believe she can do it, but I’d bet she’d self-destruct before getting a fifth of the way.”</p>
<p>“For all this talk of self-destruction and sacrificing health and sleep, she seems to be doing okay,” I said. “Freaked out after her call with you, weirdness, but… nothing that can’t be handled, I don’t think.”</p>
<p>“After the art project thing? When she threw up in class? Didn’t cry before, didn’t cry after. Not that we saw. I saw her cry once, and we were <em>all</em> crying then. Somewhere along the line, she learned that being <em>troubled</em> means people pulling away or pushing her away.”</p>
<p>“She’s gotten better at showing it,” Ashley said. “The bag. That was positive.”</p>
<p>“That’s really, really good, then. Because before? It took the world ending to crack her. Outside of that, you’d have a nine&mdash; she’s eleven now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said. “Thereabouts.”</p>
<p>“You’d have an eleven year old, then, who’s internalizing so much that she loses hair in patches or makes herself sick. She didn’t ever cry, she didn’t signal how upset she was. Even if she’s doing better, you have to pay attention.”</p>
<p>“For ten percent of what you dealt with?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Houndstooth said. “The school stuff, the Wards stuff was <em>structured</em>. There was natural pushback when she stepped over lines. Punishments, rules for the classroom, rules for the Wards, oversight, <em>teams</em> of people having hours-long meetings about her. The art project, moving classes, her being bullied because of her behavior and her visceral reactions to that, the bullying in school, all of that was the <em>easy</em> stuff.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask about the hard stuff?”</p>
<p>“You can ask, but I don’t know if I can summarize it. We had a nine year old girl with no stopping points when it came to anything social. No brakes, a practically nonexistent sense of boundaries, and zero emotional defenses.”</p>
<p>“An acquaintance of ours described her as a bull in a china shop with a profound love for dishware,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Don’t joke,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty apt,” Houndstooth said. “And I don’t think anyone’s laughing.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked.</p>
<p>“One of her classmates’ families moved away, in large part because of her.  One or two other families were seriously considering it. At least one of her teachers from the training camps was being investigated with a job and career on the line. Most people who were involved knew what the reality of Kenzie was, but procedures had to be followed, and when you have someone as vulnerable as she is, you can’t ever be one hundred percent sure. We had a similar thing with our Wards team leader, early on, but we were more proactive in anticipating it, and they were allegations of a different tint. I wish I could convey the trail of destruction.”</p>
<p>“No,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“No?” Houndstooth asked.</p>
<p>“She’s not a bull in a china shop. She’s not a headache, she’s not a bringer of destruction, a tinker, or Ward, a nine year old, or an eleven year old. You keep reducing her down, you make her small, and you make the problem big.”</p>
<p>“The problems <em>wer</em><em>e</em> big,” Houndstooth said. “The problems threatened to end several careers, derailed others, and uprooted a family from their lives and hometown. She likes and falls in love with <em>everyone</em> and it’s only because of us being attentive that she didn’t actively let herself be the prey of a villain group or dangerous lunatic in some desperate hope of finding a connection with them.”</p>
<p>“She’s not prey either,” Ashley said, more heated. “She’s Kenzie Martin. She’s a person. You may have only seen her cry once but I’ve seen her cry more times than I can count.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Tristan asked. “When?”</p>
<p>“During the meetings. After. During private conversations.”</p>
<p>“Crying is good,” Houndstooth said. “It’s a step forward. It’s very possible she’s made a lot of steps forward. It’s clear you guys care about her and believe in her. But I’ve met and interacted with Kenzie Martin, and I have a really hard time envisioning a Kenzie that’s <em>fixed</em>.”</p>
<p>“Like she’s a broken machine,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say <em>better</em> because better can mean partway. What I’m saying is that I can’t see a Kenzie that was <em>that</em> badly off, who’s… normal now. Or ever.”</p>
<p>“I hate that word,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there are any good words for something that hard to encapsulate,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“What do you advise?” I asked. “About the non-school, non-Ward stuff?”</p>
<p>“Pay attention when she talks about new friends or people in particular, get ahead of that, introduce yourself, keep a close eye on things. Talk to her teachers. Talk to her foster parents, or the people at whatever institution she’s at. They’re probably pretty overloaded, but make them pay attention. Get everyone on the same page. Same rules for everyone, boundaries, sticking to those boundaries, limit physical contact and gestures of affection unless okayed by the therapist.”</p>
<p>My eyebrows drew together. I glanced at Tristan, and he gestured, hand moving as if to dismiss, urging me to move on. I was pretty sure Houndstooth saw it too.</p>
<p>He didn’t speak up or act on it, though.</p>
<p>I made a mental note about the emphasis on foster parents. I’d need to have a conversation with others and pay more attention to Julien and his wife.</p>
<p>“Frankly, I’d really lock down the school thing. See if you can have her rotate classes or do something non-classroom. Discourage friendships with classmates, because that’s not going to go well. If she starts showing true <em>romantic</em> interest in anyone, shut it down hard. I wouldn’t advise her being on your team, frankly.”</p>
<p>“That’s extreme,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s dehumanizing and disgusting,” Ashley said. “Until she’s better, no human contact or relationships. Nobody can get close to her, nobody can show kindness, nobody can help her or accept help from her? Just a breath or two away from you saying you don’t ever think she’ll be <em>normal</em>. You’re disgusting.”</p>
<p>She was starting to walk away, toward the path that had led us up the hill.</p>
<p>“Ashley,” I said. “I get what you’re saying, but we did agree to hear him out as a favor.”</p>
<p>“You hear him out then,” she said. “Tell me what you think I need to hear when you tell the others. But I’m not going to stay here and listen to this degenerate imbecile reduce her to a problem that can be solved like that. She’s <em>human</em>.”</p>
<p>“Can I tell an anecdote?”</p>
<p>“Could I stop you without killing you?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“Can you wait for us at the station, Ashley?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>She stalked off, and we were left with Houndstooth.</p>
<p>Houndstooth looked toward me and Tristan. “There was a time, about a year back, where I was talking to a teammate. He said a food addiction was the only addiction that you couldn’t go cold turkey on. You can’t not eat, and that’s hard, when the addiction makes dealing with food in moderation next to impossible. Immediately, I thought of Kenzie. I thought, within a second or two of him saying that, he was wrong, there was another addiction like that. You say she’s human, but she’s a <em>people addict.</em> She’s addicted to humans. You can’t expect a young girl to not interact with people, and you can’t expect her to deal with people in moderation.”</p>
<p>“And you think the way to solve that is to… minimize that interaction to the barest bones?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Over months and years, gradually loosen that belt. If the therapist okays it.”</p>
<p>I sighed.</p>
<p>“She’s doing exceptionally well,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You could hold a gun to my head, and I wouldn’t say she lacked a work ethic,” Houndstooth said. “She’s brilliant for her age, she’s good-hearted in her way, and she doesn’t deserve a thousandth of what she’s gone through. It’s heartbreaking and worrying.”</p>
<p>Kenzie had named Houndstooth’s team as her second big heartbreak.</p>
<p>“Fuck the agents.”</p>
<p>“Powers and agents don’t even really play into this,” Houndstooth said. “If you took away her powers and the influence of her agent today, I’d give you all the same warnings tomorrow.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>We let ourselves into the headquarters.</p>
<p>Sveta was on her way. Chris was taking the day off for more Indulgence, not Wan, and that last part was supposed to be important.</p>
<p>Rain’s absence in particular was very much felt, now that his situation had been painted in stark relief. Everyone was a little bit worried, now.</p>
<p>Ashley had her appointment. Tristan had to give Byron his turn.</p>
<p>Kenzie sat in her chair at the table-turned desk, the projector showing the camera’s image of Cedar Point.</p>
<p>“Did you skip class to get here as quick as you did?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Kenzie said, not turning around. “I went to class, I stopped in at study hall at the start of lunch and asked if I could go early. They said okay. You can call if you need to check.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need to check,” I said. “You’re honest.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for all the emails. Sveta yelled at me. Well, she didn’t yell, but she came close. I sent her almost as many as I sent you.”</p>
<p>“Did you eat lunch?”</p>
<p>“It’s in my bag, in case I get hungry.”</p>
<p>“Too nervous?” I asked.</p>
<p>She turned around in her computer chair and smiled. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Houndstooth wanted to make sure you were okay first. Making sure you weren’t getting too much homework,” I said. “He had some tips about how we should make sure you aren’t tinkering yourself to the bone after hours.”</p>
<p>“It helps sometimes. Distracting myself with it.”</p>
<p>“We should figure out a balance. He was suspicious you were staying up late, watching and rewatching camera feeds.”</p>
<p>“When I can’t sleep it’s nice to be able to watch that stuff with my laptop beside me in the dark room. I doze off.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Did he say the embarrassing stuff?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what qualifies as embarrassing,” I said. “Problems with teachers, school. Tristan and Ashley defended you pretty fiercely.”</p>
<p>“And you?”</p>
<p>“I just want to figure out what needs to be figured out,” I said. “So everyone’s happy and healthy, and the team stays together and positive overall. I shared some of the good stuff I know of.”</p>
<p>“Did he mention the old lady?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>“She was on the internet and she wanted a replacement for her dead daughter and I almost went with her, and then later we started thinking she killed her daughter. Embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“That did come up.”</p>
<p>“And how I fell asleep watching TV on my friend’s couch?”</p>
<p>“That didn’t, I don’t think.”</p>
<p>“Super embarrassing,” she said. “And my foster parents?”</p>
<p>“Very briefly.”</p>
<p>She nodded. She smiled. “Thanks for telling me.”</p>
<p>I put my hand on the back of her chair and spun her in circles, my arm passing over her head on each rotation. “Sveta’s on her way. I think the others are mostly getting sorted out. With Rain hiding out, they’re resting up and getting prepped. Did you get the email?”</p>
<p>“I had my phone taken away. I’m supposed to go to the principal’s office with my mom or dad tomorrow if I want it back.”</p>
<p>“I suspected it was something like that,” I said. I smiled. “Less emails, and no using your phone in school unless it’s an emergency. Houndstooth is going to make a move late this afternoon.”</p>
<p>Kenzie put her hand out and stopped herself from spinning.</p>
<p>“How’s that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t want to see me or say hi?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said.</p>
<p>“He probably had a good excuse. He’s good at those. It took me a while to figure out.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t want to tip off the villains about his relationship to us.”</p>
<p>“It makes sense,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Do you want help with homework while we wait? And you can eat your lunch?” I asked. “If that nervousness has eased up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll eat,” she said. “Help with homework would be a good way to kill the time, too.”</p>
<p>“Perfect,” I said.</p>
<p>I stepped away to look at the whiteboards while Kenzie got ready.</p>
<p>Her voice small and quiet, I heard Kenzie remark, “At least I get to see him on camera.”</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap39">Shade &mdash; 4.5</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>I watched over the group.</p>
<p>We were getting settled in. Tables were moved, whiteboards arranged, and chairs put together. It was starting to look more like a hideout. Sveta was doing her name in a fancy script on her board, Kenzie was doing homework, and I had plugged my laptop in, with my notes up, but it wasn’t my focus in the moment.</p>
<p>Byron had taken his turn. Two hours and fifteen minutes after we’d parted ways, Tristan was back at the hideout. He’d taken off his black jacket and folded it over the back of a chair, and was doing some of the setup stuff, while wearing a red t-shirt, jeans, and chukka boots. He was athletic, and I remembered Byron hadn’t given me that impression when I’d seen him.</p>
<p>“Hey Tristan,” I said.</p>
<p>He’d moved over to his whiteboard, and stepped back and away to look my way.</p>
<p>“Hey, what do you think?” he asked. He extended a hand, indicating his work: he had sketched out a rough floor plan of the room. The area was an open-concept apartment, a bathroom closed off, the rest of it without walls, which gave us our room to maneuver, and it looked like Tristan was trying to figure out where the other things we needed might go. A list of bullet points said ‘cot’, ‘mini fridge’, and ‘team sign’.</p>
<p>I frowned a bit as I saw that last one.</p>
<p>“Team sign?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sure. I figured it would be good for morale. We could have Sveta paint it and put it up on the wall. Something nice to remind ourselves that we’re a team.”</p>
<p>“I could paint something,” Sveta said, looking away from her work. “I’m kind of anxious to have a name, and we’d have to decide that first.”</p>
<p>“That could be neat,” I said. “My take on reading that was that you wanted to hang the sign outside.”</p>
<p>Tristan smiled. “Something nice and big, colorful, with a by-line saying something about how we’re a covert team of heroes.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t sure,” I said.</p>
<p>“Believe it or not, I’m not a dumb guy,” he said. “Stubborn, maybe&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Definitely,” Kenzie called out, sitting at her desk. She was leaning over her homework.</p>
<p>“Most definitely,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Fine. But I’m not dumb. I’m thinking about the things we need to get in terms of things we can fold up or pack away, since we may be moving a lot. We can fold up the cot, I can carry a mini fridge, these tables have legs that can fold up to the underside, and for the sign, I was picturing getting three separate canvases and having us put them up there so it connects or lines up.”</p>
<p>“Could work,” I said.</p>
<p>“Three part name?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“No idea,” Tristan said. “Sorry, Vic, you were going to say something?”</p>
<p>“I was going to ask if you train, or if the extra strength is from the powers. Biokinesis or whichever.”</p>
<p>“I train,” Tristan said. “I was just thinking of setting up a punching bag or something, actually.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I usually end up with restless energy to burn. I lift, I run on the treadmill, and I had a class I took with Reach, but obviously it’s been a while. Works with my enhanced strength.”</p>
<p>“So it does help, then.”</p>
<p>“You look like you do something,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I do,” I said. “Or I did. I don’t have access to my dad’s equipment or the stuff I had while helping out with the Patrol Block.”</p>
<p>“Does it help? Powerwise?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Forcefield derived strength. I’m strong enough to tear apart an engine block with my hands. That wouldn’t change if I didn’t get off the couch and weighed three hundred pounds or if I was a bodybuilder.”</p>
<p>“Why bother if you can tear apart engine blocks?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Why do I walk when I could fly? I’d atrophy, for one thing, and I can’t always use my strength. I don’t have the control to do something more delicate. I&mdash; I honestly don’t trust my power, a lot of the time.”</p>
<p>Sveta came to stand beside me, to get a look at Tristan’s idea of a finished floor plan and join the conversation.</p>
<p>“…There’s a middle ground, and I’d like to be able to function in it,” I finished.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of where I’m at,” Sveta said. “Except I’m not trying to find a middle ground between one hundred miles an hour and a standstill. I’m using this body to bring myself to a point five percent of the way between zero and a thousand miles an hour.”</p>
<p>“Vroom,” Kenzie said, without turning to look at us.</p>
<p>She’d been just a little subdued.</p>
<p>“And it doesn’t change, then. It is what it is?” Tristan asked. “For both of you, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Sveta said. “Or&mdash; I don’t know, but I’m strong enough. I’m not going to go try to figure out what I can do to make these things <em>stronger</em>.”</p>
<p>As Tristan glanced at me, I made a rectangle with my fingers. “It’s complicated. It fluctuates. I could name some terms and things that apply there, but I don’t want to bore you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been bored enough times. I know a lot of the terms. Sechen ranges?”</p>
<p>“That’s one of them. Powers often get stronger with certain influencing factors. You read up on that?”</p>
<p>“We did a ton of testing with Reach, and we saw a lot of parahuman science people while we were trying to figure out a solution. They think it’s a straight multiplier. I have one point three to one point six times the strength and overall fitness.”</p>
<p>“Handy,” I said. “And Byron?”</p>
<p>“A bit of resistance to temperature extremes. He gets a higher percent, he’d probably remember his specific numbers better than I do, but unless it’s winter or we’re dealing with a heat wave, it doesn’t apply as often.”</p>
<p>“On the note of Byron… the second part to my question is, how does the exercise thing work for Byron? Because exercise is monotonous enough when you’re getting something out of it.”</p>
<p>“He commented on that a while ago, actually. We negotiated something. He made a short list of movies, and I watch his movies while I work out. Similar thing with the trips here and back. I sometimes give him extra time, especially if I have something to think about, which is most times these days.”</p>
<p>“That sounds pretty good.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t always good,” Tristan said. “Moonsong had some things right, back at the Wardens’ place. I wasn’t always good at being fair. It went the other way, Byron&mdash;”</p>
<p>Tristan stopped there.</p>
<p>“I won’t finish that thought. Byron is Byron, and I’m me, and I’ve got to own my shit without comparing. I wasn’t always good at being fair,” Tristan said. “I’m good at a lot of things. I can kick ass and look pretty great while doing it, I’m tenacious, I tend to finish what I set my mind to. But fair is hard.”</p>
<p>“It is,” I said.</p>
<p>“It’s hard enough figuring out how to be fair to ourselves,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Too true,” I said. I glanced over at Kenzie.</p>
<p>“Punching bag?” Tristan asked. He pointed at the corner, next to Chris’ whiteboard. “I don’t need to do anything special for you guys?”</p>
<p>“Regular punching bag for me,” I said. “I’ll use it. It’s going to be a chore to move if we change locations, though.”</p>
<p>“Noted,” Tristan said. “Maybe we should all get one pain-in-the-ass contribution to the hideout and this can be mine.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already got mine,” Kenzie said, from the other end of the room. She kicked her box and the images projected on the wall changed.</p>
<p>“Bag’s good,” I said, as I started walking over. “No objection.”</p>
<p>I approached Kenzie. The image was projected onto the wall in front of her, moving between the two cameras. An addition had been made, and as each person walked down the street, stylized crosshairs tracked their faces. Most had logos and names. A lot of them were just things in the vein of ‘[New31]’ with the number changing, not names.</p>
<p>One of the cameras moved. It focused in on a scene where two people wearing aprons were smoking by the back stairs of a restaurant. The little space between four buildings didn’t really qualify as an alley, as it looked like back doors and fire escapes were the only way to get down to the area. An enclave, maybe. The camera moved until it tracked a person in costume. The guy’s mask looked like it covered all but a third of his face, the bottom right of his jaw and the top left of his forehead exposed, with ceramic shards framing each ‘hole’. Curved metal bars reminiscent of piping extended around to the back of his head, holding the mask in place.</p>
<p>The camera seemed to recognize the mask, and labeled him as ‘[Kitchen Sink]’. We’d seen him before, but the label thing was new.</p>
<p>Off to the side, as part of a sidebar with data and labels, there were a series of countdown timers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>HT &amp; Team:</strong> 8:21</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Ashley Train to Station:</strong> 0:45<br>
<strong>Average Ash Walk Time:</strong> 4:10</p>
<p>When I stood behind Kenzie’s chair, I saw that even with a dozen workbooks and pieces of homework strewn in front of her, she wasn’t doing her schoolwork. She had a projected image in front of her, drawn out in three dimensions, with the same image drawn on a paper in front of her in marker. The lines of the three dimensional image looked similar to a marker’s. With gestures and prods of a pen, Kenzie adjusted the particulars.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” she asked. She used her hands, gesturing, and made it bigger. Turning around in her chair, bringing the drawn object with her, she moved her hands and superimposed the image over her head.</p>
<p>A mask, or a helmet. Eyeless, in a way, with a flat pane extending from the eyes, over her nose, down to a pointed chin. Three round lenses were placed along the line of her eyebrows, one round lens was on each cheekbone, and she had two spherical attachments, much like the buns she tended to wear her hair in. Probably intended to fit over the buns.</p>
<p>“I like it better than the one you wore for the training exercise,” I said. “It does make me think of a spider, with all of the eyes.”</p>
<p>“Is that a bad thing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you make me think ‘spider’ at all. It’s a bit too inhuman. What if… can I draw? I don’t want to ruin your drawing.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. Use my pen. Squint one eye when you want it to draw.”</p>
<p>The countdown timers marked Ashley’s departure from the train. The ‘walk time’ timer was highlighted and started counting down.</p>
<p>I tried my hand at drawing little triangles at the side of each of the round lenses. A tiny triangle to represent eyelashes.</p>
<p>“Oh, cute!” Kenzie said. “Can you draw a second, smaller one? And leave off the eyelashes on the cheekbones, because I’m doing something different there, and&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Here,” I said. I passed her the pen.</p>
<p>She began to change things, keeping all but two of the eyelashes I’d drawn.</p>
<p>Someone labeled ‘[Joe]’ walked down the street, a bag slung over his shoulder. He entered the same bar I’d encountered Moose outside of. The one where Snag and Love Lost had gone inside.</p>
<p>I looked at some of the other names.</p>
<p>“Fifi?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Kenzie asked. She looked up, and I pointed at a blonde girl with hair that looked like she’d just about destroyed it with bleaching. Frizzed out to the point I doubted she could get a comb through it. She’d resorted to using a headband and hair tie to try to get it in order. The headband and hair tie didn’t match her outfit.</p>
<p>“Oh. She looked like a Fifi. I named some of the ones I see a lot.”</p>
<p>“She does look vaguely poodle-ish, and Fifi seems like a poodle name to me.”</p>
<p>“<em>Exactly</em>,” Kenzie said, with satisfaction. She returned to writing down something that looked like code and formula, periodically poking her pen at her projected image of her mask.</p>
<p>I looked at ‘Fifi’. “Poor her. When I was a little younger than you are now, I tried dying my hair to be like my cousin, and it went badly. I was so inconsolable.”</p>
<p>“What happened after?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“My mom hired a professional to get me back to normal, and it was mostly fixed. We bought some products to keep my hair from ending up like <em>that</em> after. I can’t imagine the professional or the products were cheap, and we were pretty tight on cash back then. She knew it was important to me.”</p>
<p>My heart hurt a little, thinking of that.</p>
<p>“That’s the way it should be,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>She turned my way, putting on the projected helmet so it was superimposed over her head. When she took her hands away and moved her head, the helmet moved with her head.</p>
<p>Now, though, the eyes of the mask widened and closed, as camera-like shutters closed around the edges. The eyelashes moved up and down a little, and shutters moved in lopsided ways, with only some of the shutters closing. Coming down from the top, curved forward, angry. Coming in from the bottom.</p>
<p>“Are you changing your expression?”</p>
<p>“Yes! It worked. Awesome. Okay, and let’s try this.”</p>
<p>Her eyelashes moved, until one was pointing straight up, one was pointing straight down. The eyes all briefly turned white.</p>
<p>“I think that worked. White eyes and… targeting mode?”</p>
<p>“Not targeting mode. I could build something like the flash gun into it. I can strike a pose and do the eye thing, like they’re crosshairs, and flash. There’d probably only be room for one shot. Okay, colors&mdash;”</p>
<p>She tapped her pen on her desk. The mask changed from shades of gray to pink and sky blue. I winced, and she immediately changed to the next. Seafoam green and black. Through each change, the circles at her cheekbones remained a slightly different shade, more muted.</p>
<p>“Something less garish, maybe?” I asked. “That one looks a little villainous. Cute, but villainous.”</p>
<p>She tapped her pen a few times, then made a mark on the paper.</p>
<p>Lemon-lime and dark gray, with green-gray circles for the cheekbones.</p>
<p>“Better.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, I know a thing. I can do a thing.”</p>
<p>She turned, and she started scribbling. She seemed energized.</p>
<p>But as she turned, the image at one of her cheekbones broke up, becoming transparent, like a few squares had been cut out of the image. It flickered as I moved my head to view it at another angle.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a distortion,” I said. I pointed.</p>
<p>“Silly me,” she said.</p>
<p>The entire helmet disappeared.</p>
<p>“Something similar happened when your picture was taken at the Warden’s HQ,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You’re wearing a projection?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” she said. She scribbled. “I’m wearing tech, and it conflicts with stuff so it can be hard to coordinate. I wouldn’t call it <em>wearing</em>.”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“Wearing makes me think full-body, or covering my head and I mean, I had that costume thing for the training, and that didn’t last that long. How could or would I wear something else and have it last all day or whatever? I mean, I wish I could.”</p>
<p>“I wish <em>I</em> could,” I said. I didn’t want to press or be harsh, but I didn’t want to let this lie either. I went easy, instead. “I’m slightly concerned if you’re using projections like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m not that devious,” Kenzie said. “I wouldn’t bring something and pretend to have a short battery life so I can hide that I have a longer battery life for something else I’m secretly using. That’s not what I do and that’s not how I am.”</p>
<p>“I know,” I said. “I don’t get the impression you’re devious or that you’d go to those lengths.”</p>
<p>Kenzie looked up at the clock.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Average Ash Walk Time:</strong> &mdash;1:13</p>
<p>“She’ll turn up,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know. I just want her here before Houndstooth calls,” Kenzie said. “One second.”</p>
<p>She kicked the cube. It went dark, and the camera image dropped away.</p>
<p>“Victoria!” Tristan called me from the far end of the room.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Can we use your computer?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Tristan and Sveta gathered together at my computer, Tristan’s hands at the keyboard.</p>
<p>“The tech you’re wearing. The distortions. I want to make sure you’re taking care of yourself. That you don’t have dark circles under your eyes, or bruises, or anything like that.”</p>
<p>She turned her head to look at me over her shoulder and smiled. “It’s off. I turned my tech off to synchronize everything across all fields. This is me.”</p>
<p>She showed me her phone, where the progress bar was filling up.</p>
<p>“Gotcha,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know Houndstooth said stuff. I think he said it in a caring way because he’s one of the best guys out there. True blue hero, like Weld. Like you.”</p>
<p>I was reminded of how I’d handled Presley on the train. I’d recognized how she’d needed me to be more than human, because she idolized me, she’d seen me as something to reach for.</p>
<p>I wondered if Kenzie wanted me to be the same thing.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I am. I’m pretty angry about things. I’m… really concerned about a lot of things. Negative emotions drive an awful lot of what I do.”</p>
<p>The lock on the door clicked. Ashley let herself in, then locked it behind her. She smiled at Kenzie and me, then gave the other two a small salute.</p>
<p>Kenzie had visibly brightened at Ashley’s appearance.</p>
<p>“The things you do are good,” Kenzie said. “At least as far as I’ve seen and researched.”</p>
<p><em>She researched me.</em></p>
<p>“And I think that’s what counts,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“It’s nuanced.”</p>
<p>“If Houndstooth sat you down to tell you about me and he didn’t say I’m bad at nuance, he screwed up,” Kenzie said. “And he doesn’t screw up.”</p>
<p>The projector box lit up, and the video image popped back up. Kenzie’s phone changed from the progress bar, and her helmet reappeared, floating just over the paper where it had been drawn.</p>
<p>“Roughly one minute until Houndstooth!” Kenzie reported.</p>
<p>“Got it,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Ashley approached, standing by Kenzie’s chair, and laid a hand on Kenzie’s left shoulder.</p>
<p>“You good?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Working hands. No pain. We’re still working with this cretin?”</p>
<p>“<em>Cretin</em>?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“Houndstooth,” Ashley said. “He didn’t impress me.”</p>
<p>“Okay, wow. Let me start by saying you impress me,” Kenzie said, looking up at Ashley. “I love those videos you’re in, and I loved seeing you train. You’re awesome. And you’re totally, one hundred percent wrong, this once. Because Houndstooth is awesome and impressive too.”</p>
<p>“Houndstooth’s concerns seemed to come from a well-intentioned, good place,” I said, interjecting. Kenzie’s head whipped around to look at me over her other shoulder. I added, “And despite that, he seemed to come to some extreme conclusions. There’s nuance, between where you’re coming from and where you end up. Like we were just talking about.”</p>
<p>“When I called him a cretin I was being gentle. He’s a disgusting, disappointing, <em>subnormal</em> excuse for a hero, cape, or human being.”</p>
<p>“I will fight you over this,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You’d lose.”</p>
<p>“I will <em>go to war</em> with you. Houndstooth was one of the coolest people to me at one of my uncoolest times.”</p>
<p>Tristan and Sveta had noticed things were a little hairy and were approaching at a jog. I interjected, saying, “We might want to drop this. Let the topic lie.”</p>
<p>“No,” Kenzie said. “Not if she’s going to say anything more like what she just said.”</p>
<p>“He talked about you like you were nothing more than a problem.”</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> a problem!” Kenzie said, raising her voice.</p>
<p>“Easy,” I said. Tristan and Sveta joined us.</p>
<p>“I’m a problem,” Kenzie said, quieter. “I <em>was.</em>”</p>
<p>“You’re more than the problem,” Ashley said. “That waste of space didn’t&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Do you want to go to war?” Kenzie asked, rising out of her seat. “I can build an army of camera drones. I have advantage in the air. I have battlefield awareness. And I’ll fight you on this until you explode me all over the place or you say you’re wrong about him. <em>Don’t say bad things about him.</em>  Not when he’s someone that counts. Not when you’re someone that counts. Okay?”</p>
<p>Sveta reached out and pushed Kenzie back down into her seat. Tristan was closer to Ashley, facing her, ready to get between the two.</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Sveta said. “Ashley’s coming from a good place here.”</p>
<p>“I know that,” Kenzie said. “I also know that Houndstooth is.”</p>
<p>“You’re better than he makes you out to be. You can’t put so much faith in the words of someone who so clearly knows so little,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>Kenzie shook her head, smiling like she couldn’t believe the conversation she was a part of.</p>
<p>“He’s weak, and he’s a loser. He’s the lowest of the low.”</p>
<p>The phone trilled with a rising series of beeps. The projected image on the screen showed the person calling: Houndstooth.</p>
<p>Kenzie leaped forward, swatting aside Sveta’s hand and dodging mine. She grabbed the front of Ashley’s top, and hauled it down, making Ashley bend down.</p>
<p>Ashley’s hand moved, and Tristan grabbed her wrist, stopping it from going wherever it was going to go. He grabbed Kenzie with the other hand, ready to pull her away if need be.</p>
<p>“Woah,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I moved closer, putting my hands on Kenzie’s shoulders, freeing Tristan to focus more on Ashley.</p>
<p>So small. Her shoulders were narrow.</p>
<p>Kenzie raised her free hand, and pressed it against Ashley’s mouth, so her fingers were on either side of Ashley’s nose. Had her fingers been longer, the tips and nails might have been near Ashley’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>The phone trilled its beeps again.</p>
<p>“Please don’t say anything. Please.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, silence.</p>
<p>The phone spat out its series of beeps.</p>
<p>“Please let this go okay,” Kenzie said. “That will do more than anything.”</p>
<p>The silence hung. The phone could only ring so many times.</p>
<p>Kenzie started to smile, and the smile faltered. “Please? I’ll do anything.”</p>
<p>Ashley straightened, pulling away from Kenzie’s hands. She turned away, folding her arms.</p>
<p>The rest of us relaxed. Kenzie, too, turned away, stepping away from my hands. She grabbed the phone off the table and tossed it to Tristan.</p>
<p>The phone was mid-ring when Tristan answered.</p>
<p>“Sorry about the delay. Capricorn here. Four of the six members of the team are here, and our coach is here too,” Tristan said. He backed up a few steps, until Ashley was in front of him, facing him. “I think we’re going to put you on speakerphone if that’s okay.”</p>
<p>Ashley nodded once.</p>
<p>“Great,” Tristan said. A response for both Houndstooth and Ashley, it seemed.</p>
<p>Kenzie hit a key.</p>
<p>“Hello again,” Houndstooth said. “I’ve got my team here, and we’re north of Cedar Point. We’re getting sorted out, costumes already on, but there’s other stuff to do. Minions to summon, ammo to load. I’m really hoping that none of it is needed.”</p>
<p>“Same here,” Tristan said. “We’ve been keeping an eye on things and I think it’s pretty quiet right now.”</p>
<p>“Perfect.”</p>
<p>I raised my hand a bit to signal I was going to speak, then stepped forward a bit. “Victoria here. I think there are three villains&mdash;”</p>
<p>Kenzie’s hand went up, four fingers extended.</p>
<p>“Four villains out and about around the city. A few left on a road trip earlier in the afternoon. There are also a couple you’ll want to be aware of.”</p>
<p>“Anything you can give us is great.”</p>
<p>Kenzie hit a key. The camera moved to Kitchen Sink, with his ceramic mask.</p>
<p>“Kitchen Sink. He’s the closest to you, big, minor brute aspect, but his thing is he acts as a blaster. Long and sustained series of junk being thrown at high velocities. Everything but the kitchen sink, as the saying goes.”</p>
<p>“That’s so bad a schtick it’s great,” a voice on the line said. One of Houndstooth’s subordinates, feminine-sounding.</p>
<p>“He’s in the company of Hookline. Minor mover, has a hundred-foot long cable he telekinetically controls. It can’t be broken or damaged, short of some very select powers, and it will shake off or slip free of a lot of things that would snag or impede another weapon. Frost, hands that try to grab it. So don’t try. It moves faster and acts like a whip, so be super careful if a fight happens. There’s a hook on the end, and he’s most dangerous if you’re at or just inside that hundred foot limit of his range where the hook is flying around. Which brings me to my next point.”</p>
<p>“They’re willing to hurt people?” Houndstooth asked.</p>
<p>“Kitchen Sink and Hookline are. They’re part of one clique in Cedar Point that’s more violent than the others. Aggressive, violent, even borderline bloody. They might be acting as enforcers for others.”</p>
<p>“Breaking kneecaps,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Got it,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“Hookline and Sink,” the feminine voice said. “Oh my god.”</p>
<p>“Moose seems to be going around between groups, passing on messages or checking on things. Strong brute, something to do with shockwaves. He hits hard, he moves a lot faster than you’d expect from someone that big, and he has decent combat sense. I wish we could give you more information on him, but all I know is from a brief scrap with him.”</p>
<p>“You said the other two might pick a fight. What about this guy?”</p>
<p>“Low odds the other two pick a fight without checking with the leadership, but if someone <em>was</em> to pick a fight, it’d be people from their group. Moose would sooner negotiate or look to talk than fight, and he’d only really fight if he thought he needed to or if he was certain he could win. I think your worry is going to be having something in mind to tell Moose that passes the sniff test.”</p>
<p>“We’re curious what’s going on, the Hill is a mess, and we’re wondering if these are greener pastures than Greenwich.”</p>
<p>Tristan said, “If others are going to show interest, we want to drop a hint. Something that makes them wonder. You could mention sponsorship and a reshuffling of jurisdictions.”</p>
<p>“There’s talk of war,” Sveta interjected. “I know someone who’s having to spend time away, and they’re bringing people in from other teams to fill holes.”</p>
<p>“I heard about that,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“You could use that. It happened with villain communities in the past. A void appears, villains rush to fill it, there’s upheaval, and then things settle.”</p>
<p>She looked at me as she said that last bit.</p>
<p>I’d said something like that at the group therapy meeting, hadn’t I?</p>
<p>“If Moose challenges us, I’ll say something like that.”</p>
<p>“There’s also a woman that’s collecting protection money right now. Bluestocking. From the brainiac clique.”</p>
<p>“These guys are so lame, I love it,” Houndstooth’s subordinate said.</p>
<p>“There’s something to keep in mind,” I said. “These guys congregated here. <em>If</em> something happens, and I don’t know if Moose would let it unless you forced the issue, then you’ll have a lot more in your hair. They’re banding together and as lame as any individual might be, they’re finding a lot of people who match up with them. Thematically or in style.”</p>
<p>“We’re seeing that more in general,” Houndstooth said. “Lots of capes condensed into a relatively tight geographic area.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to see it in effect here. Two clairvoyants are keeping an eye on the area. One of them is a clairaudient, so they’ll have an ear on the area too. I could go into detail, but I think it’s better and easier to just say that once you enter Cedar Point they’re going to be fully aware of everything you say or do. Be careful what you say, and be aware we can’t communicate with you unless it’s an emergency.”</p>
<p>“That also means no mockery or jokes,” Houndstooth said, his voice quieter, like he didn’t have his mouth near the phone. “And as far as we’re concerned, your team doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>“It would mean a ton if you could be especially careful about that,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We’ll be careful,” Houndstooth said. “I trust my guys. Give us a couple of minutes, and we’ll move through, make our faces known. I want to plan what we do if we run into the guys you talked about.”</p>
<p>“Call us again when it’s time,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Will do. I like this a lot, good briefing, great intelligence. This is great stuff, guys.”</p>
<p>The call ended.</p>
<p>Tristan huffed out a breath, glancing at Ashley.</p>
<p>“Great stuff, and he likes it,” Kenzie said, quiet. Her legs kicked, just barely scuffing the plastic rim that the wheels of the computer chair stuck down from. “Now I get to see Houndstooth on camera. Wooo.”</p>
<p>Her voice was so quiet it might have sounded unenthusiastic, but the speed her legs kicked at doubled with that last utterance.</p>
<p>“We should get people out there in case things go bad and we need to extract,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I can fly out,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’ll go,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I can be there in ten minutes if I need to be, maybe as few as five,” Tristan said. “I’ll hold down the fort here until then. Ashley&mdash; I’d rather keep you in reserve. If <em>everything</em> falls to pieces, we’ll bring you in to great effect.”</p>
<p>She nodded, and then she walked away, approaching the empty whiteboard that was supposed to be hers. Some of her things were in a bag at the base of the board.</p>
<p>Sveta and I stepped out, and I used my flight to lift up off the fire escape.</p>
<p>“I’m worried about them,” Sveta said. “And I wish there was a flagpole or tree close by I could grab.”</p>
<p>“I can help a bit with that last part,” I said. I rose up and away, then extended a hand.</p>
<p>She shot her hand and arm at me, and I caught it. She pulled herself my way, not at her fastest, but fast enough I felt my heart jump in my chest.</p>
<p>I flew back and away, as she hauled herself in, and matched her general direction. It made for a tiny bit more slack.</p>
<p>She let go of me, and she pulled herself to a tree. From there, she moved to a roof.</p>
<p>Like a frog’s tongue, snapping out, seizing something. But the frog went to the fly, rather than the other way around. To the branch, to the railing, to the fence, then to the chimney.</p>
<p>She was faster than me for short distances, and only a bit slower for the sustained movement. We didn’t have far to go, so she did pretty well at getting ahead of me. Only the escape from the fire escape had slowed her down.</p>
<p>“Hold up,” I called out, as she started to move northward. “Here’s good.”</p>
<p>We parked ourselves near where I’d been the day prior, on a rooftop with the water separating us and Cedar Point.</p>
<p>“I’m glad it’s you and me,” she said.</p>
<p>I bumped her shoulder with mine.</p>
<p>The phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket, connected my earbuds, and put one bud in my ear, one in Sveta’s.</p>
<p>“One camera on H.T., one in Moose’s general vicinity,” Kenzie announced. “The valiant H.T. is leading his team in. Five of them.”</p>
<p>I touched the button on the screen to mute my end of the conversation, so we’d only hear, not say anything.</p>
<p>“We tried to get ahold of Rain and we couldn’t. I’m worried,” Sveta said. “I know he’s impossible to get ahold of when he’s with his family, they’re off the grid but I don’t know.”</p>
<p>The phone flicked between a view of Houndstooth and the villains.</p>
<p>“Today’s the third time Chris chose the optimism-indulgence route in five days, I think.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? He’s not balancing it out?”</p>
<p>“I asked what he was doing to balance it out and he said I should mind my own business.”</p>
<p>I could see the thread of what Sveta was getting at.</p>
<p>“You’re worried about things as a whole.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Except maybe worry was the wrong word. It implied hand-wringing. Sweating, nervousness.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that I was afraid or that it was <em>worse</em> than worry, either. I was becoming far more aware of the problems, for things as a whole.</p>
<p>“<em>What the mother-loving hell?</em>” Moose’s voice came through the earbuds. It sounded weird, captured by cameras at a great distance, sent to Kenzie, sent to us, passed through the earbuds. He’d just received the news. The video on the phone showed him sending people away on errands. Fetching others.</p>
<p>“We have movement,” Tristan said. “They’re getting organized.”</p>
<p>We watched. I carried on with my conversation with Sveta. “Ashley has had a couple of serious episodes that I’ve seen now. Many lesser episodes, too.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“There’s a big part of me that was waiting for the other shoes to drop and that part of me feels… not worse, now that those shoes have dropped,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel not worse.”</p>
<p>“I can see flashes and hints of what you’re trying to bring out in Ashley,” I admitted. “She’s not someone I would have spent time with, in another context. I don’t know how to handle things when she casually mentions her capacity to murder people, as if it’s a way to win an argument.”</p>
<p>“The threats are usually empty,” Sveta said. “That’s a plus.”</p>
<p>“I want to figure this out,” I said. “I want to <em>help</em>. It’s like Kenzie is a distillation of every vulnerable person I’ve ever tried to help, and Ashley is a distillation of every really <em>fascinating</em> branding exercise where you take a random villain and try to paint them as a hero and even bring out the hero inside them. Tristan and Byron are this <em>really</em> fascinating problem with powers and I’m a power geek and I really wonder if there’s a solution.”</p>
<p>“How do you parse Rain?” Sveta asked quiet.</p>
<p>“I mean&mdash;” I stopped. “I’m doing exactly what Ashley got so angry at Houndstooth for doing. I’m reducing people down to conveniently sized problems. I get that, you know? They aren’t <em>just</em> that. Kenzie is really complex and intelligent, she’s clearly been through a lot, and I one hundred percent believe Houndstooth when he says she’s good hearted. The fact that she clearly adores Ashley and she fought her <em>that hard</em> on things to stand up for someone else she holds close to her heart? That’s amazing. I could say similar things about Ashley, Tristan, Byron.”</p>
<p>Sveta nodded. “And me?”</p>
<p>“I’m so caught up in everything I…” I tried to find the words, and felt a pang. I tried to make sense of that feeling as I said, “I find myself missing you, even though you’re there.”</p>
<p>“I know. We should have talked like this sooner.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing amazing and my biggest fear with you is that I’m going to be an obstruction, not a help.”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t ever see that.”</p>
<p>“I worry. I don’t want to tamper with something that’s working.”</p>
<p>“I need help. I’m anxious, and there are things I need. Not from a teammate, but&mdash;”</p>
<p>“From a friend?” I asked.</p>
<p>She nodded, something in her rattling slightly with the movement.</p>
<p>“As one part of that, then, I really want to take you shopping, that needs addressing, because this&mdash;”</p>
<p>I touched her top. She was wearing a beige top with a blue anchor on the front. The top was in two pieces, knotted above the shoulder, with smaller bits knotted along her sides.</p>
<p>“This is cute, but I really want to see more sides of you.”</p>
<p>“I want you to take me shopping too,” she said.</p>
<p>I reached for her hand, and I gave it a waggle.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about Rain a lot,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“He has me worried. Not just because of the hit out on his head. But because he’s not telling the truth about everything. The lies make sense, it seems to make sense to hide things when in his situation. But I’m not getting to see that good side of him either. So for now, I want to help him. But my motivations are somewhat selfish. My hometown got wiped out by a seemingly insurmountable, inevitable, unstoppable force. We lost. I&mdash; I don’t think I ever fully came back from those losses.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“And now we have Rain being targeted by a seemingly insurmountable, inevitable, unstoppable force. I’m being selfish, but I want to help him and get a win this time around.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s selfish.”</p>
<p>“My entire hero career before the hospital and the years leading up to that career were a fantasy or exercise in me having powers and being a hero, and I’m not sure I was ever <em>heroic</em> about it. I just see that past me as wholly motivated in selfishness, ego, pride, and a drive to be celebrated.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s selfish,” Sveta said. “You’re not that. You’re here, doing <em>this</em>. You’re helping.”</p>
<p>“The ends justify the… possible justifications?” I asked. “I just had this conversation with Kenzie. I’m not sure it’s a good thing if I’m having it again.”</p>
<p>“It’s where your head and heart are at.”</p>
<p>I shrugged, looking at the video feed.</p>
<p>Moose and Prancer were meeting up. Prancer had two friends with him. On the other feed, the heroes were walking through the neighborhood. Talking to shop owners and residents. Sink and Hookline watched from the sidelines, Houndstooth’s subordinates hanging back and watching them in turn.</p>
<p>“Where are <em>you</em> at?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Weld has been telling me things about what’s going on elsewhere. Things he shouldn’t be telling me, but I think a lot of it is the kind of thing like a husband with a certain position might tell his wife, sometimes, even when those things are confidential.”</p>
<p>“Wife?” I asked. I raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Sveta said, lifting her chin a bit, looking mock-affronted. “Not another word about that.”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who said the word.”</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Sveta said. “I can’t repeat those things, but I worry more than I used to. I get anxious. There’s a part of everyone else in the group in me, and when they struggle it feels like I’m struggling.”</p>
<p>“I can sort of relate to that.”</p>
<p>“I need people and I scare them away. Tristan told me what Houndstooth said. None of it’s too surprising. There are people who know a dangerous amount about me and I think they’d hurt me if they had a chance. I’m a killer. I’m constantly at war with another side of myself. I’m perpetually off balance and I don’t know if I’ll ever have that balance.”</p>
<p>“That kinship might be why you’re able to connect to the others.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it. Don’t sound like Weld.”</p>
<p>“It’s true,” I said. “You’re the team’s mom.”</p>
<p>“Oh no,” Sveta said. “That’s so much worse than what I thought you were going to say. I thought you were going to call me the team’s heart, like Weld does. I can’t be a <em>mother.</em>  No!”</p>
<p>I was about to respond, but Sveta reached up with a hand. Her prosthetic finger tapped the side of the phone.</p>
<p>Moose and Prancer. They’d wrangled three others. I didn’t recognize any of the three. Bluestocking was way off to the side, just barely in earshot. Almost half of Houndstooth’s group had turned around and were keeping an eye on Hookline and Kitchen Sink.</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“Passing through,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“To where? This is a peninsula. It’s why Hollow Point is a <em>point</em>.”</p>
<p>Houndstooth shrugged, radiating <em>smug</em>, a lack of concern.</p>
<p>“The Kings of the Hill. You’re a long way away from where you normally hang out.”</p>
<p>“Changing times. Some other people might be looking to take over the Hill.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t explain why you’re here,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Maybe they want to be Kings of the Point,” Moose said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be gained here,” Prancer said. “It’ll take you twice as long and five times as many fights to get half as far.”</p>
<p>Houndstooth laughed. One or two members of his group were almost simultaneous in laughing as well, but Houndstooth was louder, more confident, and probably the focus of the camera’s microphone, to boot.</p>
<p>The villains shifted their footing. There were no laughs. They didn’t seem impressed.</p>
<p>Houndstooth explained. “You’re aware you just described an uphill battle to a group called Kings of the Hill?”</p>
<p>“Then you should know all the better,” Prancer said. The force of the response was hampered a bit by the fact that Houndstooth’s group was chuckling again.</p>
<p>Points to Houndstooth, he was doing pretty well here. This wasn’t the first time I’d seen him interact with someone and not really have the presence or power to stand up to the people he was facing down.</p>
<p>“What a theme. The hunting hound, nipping at the fleeing deer’s heels,” Houndstooth said.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to nip, I’m going to gore,” Prancer said. “You’re not going to come out ahead in this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Houndstooth asked. “Would you like to have a little skirmish right here? Your eight to our five. Or are you going to let us pass through?”</p>
<p>“You can’t <em>pass through</em>,” Prancer said, exasperated. “Its a peninsula. You can turn around and go back the way you came, though.”</p>
<p>Houndstooth chuckled. He put a hand on a teammate’s shoulder, and turned the guy around. The five members of his group turned to go.</p>
<p>“Faster response,” I said. I touched the button on the phone to unmute myself. “I’d like to keep a camera on Prancer’s group. I want to see their response.”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan,” Tristan’s voice came through.</p>
<p>A few seconds passed, as Houndstooth’s team headed back the way they’d come.</p>
<p>“I’m not a mom,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>There was conversation on the phone.</p>
<p>“I don’t want them in here,” Hookline said. “Fuck that.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know what they’re doing,” Prancer said. “It’s fine. Go easy.”</p>
<p>“They made a mockery of us.”</p>
<p>“They made a mockery of themselves,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“I think you’re the only one that’s dwelling on the peninsula thing,” Velvet said.</p>
<p>“We’re fine,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Were they related to the blonde, Victoria?” Moose asked. “Pretty much the first thing I said to her was that she’d end up outnumbered and having to skedaddle. Someone hears that, they might call friends.”</p>
<p>“They’re still outnumbered,” Velvet pointed out.</p>
<p>Prancer replied, “I don’t know, Moose, but yes, we will always have the numbers advantage. For now I’m content to wait and see what happens. If they move in, we have the resources to answer them. Bluestocking? Can you tell Bitter Pill I want to talk to her about her team? I want to keep a closer eye on things.”</p>
<p>“I can,” the woman with glasses said. The one that had been collecting protection money.</p>
<p>“We’ll be fine,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“What I’m wondering,” Kitchen Sink said, “Could this have to do with the truck of&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Shut up this very second,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>“No,” Prancer said, “I doubt it does, and you shouldn’t talk business unless we’re inside with the Speedrunners or Caveat helping to ensure things are private.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing a lot of talking,” Sink said. “But I’m thinking you’re not doing a lot of <em>doing</em>. Those guys walked in and walked out. They might come back and they’ll be a headache. Speaking as someone who’s been collecting <em>rent</em>&mdash;”</p>
<p>“If you want to talk business, you do it inside,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“&mdash;it’s going to impact that,” Sink said. “We have to explain. <em>You</em> have to explain, really, because I’m saying fuck this conversation.”</p>
<p>He punched Hookline lightly in the shoulder, gestured. The pair of them turned to walk away.</p>
<p>“Cracks and clues,” Tristan’s voice could be heard over the phone.</p>
<p>“And two of the locals following Houndstooth’s group,” Kenzie reported. “They’re aiming to catch up.”</p>
<p>I took off. I paused in the air, hand out.</p>
<p>Sveta sent out her hand. With the wind currents above the water, the hand moved off-course. I flew over to catch it in the same moment she flexed her tendrils and sent the hand to where I’d been.</p>
<p>We coordinated, I caught her hand before it dropped into the water, and she pulled herself to me. She had a silly smile on her face when she drew close.</p>
<p>“We’ll work on that,” I said.</p>
<p>I flew over the water. When we reached the first tall building, I dropped Sveta, before changing course again.</p>
<p>She went low to the ground, pulling herself straight to the street level. I flew high, to the point where Birdbrain shouldn’t have a high enough perspective to see me, much like with Kenzie’s high-flying cameras.</p>
<p>I retrieved my phone. “Do we act?”</p>
<p>“Act,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I drew closer.</p>
<p>Hookline’s hook was out, and Kitchen Sink had a machete in one hand and a gallon tank of probably-kerosene in the other. He kept the large red plastic can, tossed away the machete, tossed away the textbook, tossed away the manhole cover&mdash;</p>
<p>I was guessing, <em>hoping</em> they wanted to count coup, injure and disappear.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem terribly bright. I didn’t want to let them count coup or do worse. We’d made a pledge to Houndstooth’s group.</p>
<p>Sveta’s hands appeared out of nowhere, grabbing Hookline by the ankles. He fell hard on the initial tug, and was then dragged beneath a parked car.</p>
<p>The hook moved, lashing out. It caught on the corner of a building, Hookline’s attempt to haul himself free.</p>
<p>My focus in the moment was on Kitchen Sink.</p>
<p>I landed so I was a foot behind him, pushing out with my aura.</p>
<p>“Run,” I said.</p>
<p>He turned, wheeling around with hand drawn back, a rather large, full bottle of alcohol gripped by the neck&mdash;</p>
<p>I smashed my forehead into his nose. When he didn’t immediately go down, I did it again. I didn’t give him a chance to recover from there. My forcefield was down throughout the process, as I stayed within a foot of him, my aura buzzing with the range pulled closer to me, active and focused on him.</p>
<p>I could fly, so I didn’t need footing. I used it when I had it, to give a little more oomph when I punched him in the stomach, but at the times I would have needed to pause to get my feet in the right places under me, flight drove me forward. Punch, knee to his stomach, a shove against his shoulder, as he drew the connected arm back to swing with the bottle or use his power to throw it point-blank.</p>
<p>He realized he couldn’t draw either weapon back, and dropped the plastic jug, jabbing at me instead. He hit me in the ribs, and it hurt.</p>
<p>I hit him in the nose, and I was willing to bet it hurt more.</p>
<p>He realized what was happening, and compensated with an exaggerated step back, anticipating he’d be pushed away, the foot would arrest that movement.</p>
<p>I brought my hand close to his face as I flew up, and he shielded it.</p>
<p>He was trying not to fall down, but with his feet planted far apart&mdash;</p>
<p>I flew down, my foot striking on his thigh, close to the pelvis. It forced him into awkward almost-splits.</p>
<p>My hand on the back of his head, I pushed his face down toward the road. He didn’t try to stop the movement with his arms out, instead folding his around his face, to shield it.</p>
<p>The impact was hard, elbows striking the road, and from the sound he made, his nose hit the arms that were around his face, and that hurt enough.</p>
<p>Sveta had moved across the street. She stayed low, and her hand snaked out, snatching for Hookline’s ankles, trying to once again drag him beneath the vehicle, forcing him to clamber or squeeze out.</p>
<p>As I landed on a car roof, intentionally making a sound, he glanced back at me. His face was bound in ripcord or something like it, with a gap for his eyes. It pulled his teeth back so they stood out, perpetually bared.</p>
<p>At least he brushed.</p>
<p>The distraction meant Sveta could get a hold on him. He stabbed an engine block with the hook, to try to arrest his movement, hands on the chain.</p>
<p>I walked over to the hook, and slapped it free. By all rights, I should have destroyed it, but his thing was that he made his <em>weapon</em> invincible, untouchable.</p>
<p>He tried to catch me with it, but Sveta had him and the hook didn’t reach out as fast as Sveta pulled him beneath a dusty construction vehicle.</p>
<p>I collected a mailbox and a pallet of construction material, and set to blocking off his exits, so he would be stuck beneath the truck until someone got him out.</p>
<p>There were others approaching already.</p>
<p>The fastest of them arrived. Moose. Love Lost. A mismatched pair.</p>
<p>Sveta put out her hand, not extending her arm, and I caught it, clasping her wrist as she clasped mine.</p>
<p>Braindead and Birdbrain had no doubt clued in the local villains. They would also let people know what Hookline and Sink had been intent on doing.</p>
<p>Others sounded like they were just around the corner.</p>
<p>I glanced at Love Lost. The woman who wanted to kill Rain. Who wanted to torture him to death.</p>
<p>Rage. Anger. Hate.</p>
<p>There was so much I didn’t know about that scenario, but I could see that the sentiment was very much real.</p>
<p>Her claw went to her mask. I had just about no interest in seeing what she could do. I flew skyward and out of reach, bringing Sveta with me.</p>
<p>Hopefully, for just a little bit longer, we would leave them wondering who we were.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap40">Shade &mdash; Interlude 4b</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Rain climbed down from the back of the pickup truck, slinging his bag over his shoulder with the contents rattling. Two older guys departed at the same time. The truck puttered as Rain walked around to the driver’s side door. He handed over some bills. The inside of the truck was choked with the smell of cigarettes, and the man at the wheel was partially obscured in the dark and smoke, his features lit by the changing colors of the radio display.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said. He didn’t sound like himself.</p>
<p>He only got a grunt in response. The driver counted the money before putting it aside.</p>
<p>The two older guys approached the window, one of them with a twenty-four pack of beer that looked badly weathered, as if it had sat out in the rain for a month. It was the other that went to the window to pay.</p>
<p>With the settlement being so off the beaten track, the only way to get in and out was to either have a working vehicle or to pay someone to make the drive. Rain was pretty sure that his comings and goings were being reported to people higher up the food chain.</p>
<p>He didn’t have alternatives, not unless Erin gave him a ride.</p>
<p>He kept his head down and made the walk along the side of the road. Here and there, the packed dirt was loose, not held together by weeds or grass, and his footing slipped. It made the walk a trudge.</p>
<p>It was late, and houses were lit by candle and lamps. Across the field, a tall bonfire blazed. The two guys with the beer were making their way there, climbing over a fence to take the shortest path possible. Were Rain to visit, he’d see people like Jay. Old enough to mess around and get into trouble, but not yet married. There had been a time when he’d wanted to be one of the older boys at those little parties.</p>
<p>Were he to visit, he’d be grudgingly welcomed. He’d be expected to laugh at the jokes, to agree with the things said, to play along. He would be expected to take the ribbing and jokes at his expense, and there would be a lot. He would be expected to keep to the unspoken contract. Adults let those kinds of gatherings happen because the people who attended played along. They didn’t complain <i>too much</i> when it came time to do something with or for the sake of the community. The tribe. The <i>gang</i>.</p>
<p>Rain walked, well aware he’d let the day, afternoon and early evening slip away from him. He’d left the others and caught a train, and he’d been unable to bring himself to come back here. ‘Home’.</p>
<p>Jittery nervousness had transformed into a dull feeling of dread. That dread leeched into and through him like a poison, as if his realization about his high chance of dying had transformed into something that made him feel like he was being eaten alive, being killed by the dread.</p>
<p>He would have thrown up, if he weren’t so tense that he wasn’t sure he could bend over and bring himself to.</p>
<p>He pushed himself forward. Erin’s house was the next one, and there was light in the window. He trudged onward, the earth at the side of the road giving way beneath his feet, as he sank in, pulled himself up and forward, then sank again in a few steps later.</p>
<p>He would have walked in the middle of the road, but Jay’s group was out there at the fire drinking, and Rain didn’t trust them or many of the others to have headlights on and their eyes on the road.</p>
<p>Erin was there, sitting at her window on the second floor. She was keeping an eye out for him, still wearing the shirt with the cross on the front from earlier. The light from her television cast the shadows around her in various shades of green.</p>
<p>She raised a hand in a wave as he drew close enough for the light from the house’s windows to illuminate him. He raised his own hand.</p>
<p>With the house being at the end of a path, and Erin being on the second floor, her voice was almost inaudible as she asked something. She pointed with him as she asked it, then raised her hand in a barely-visible ok sign.</p>
<p>Was he okay?</p>
<p>Rain stood a very real chance of dying.</p>
<p>He was standing there, not responding, his thoughts tearing through his brain. He had options but none of them were options. If he went to the Wardens for help he would become embroiled in something bigger, because he knew things and he’d be expected to share those things. The <em>Fallen</em> would target him and there was no guarantee the Wardens could keep him safe. There was a chance it would push away Erin and pull him away from the group, as he was taken to safe custody and expected to testify. There was a chance the revelation would mean Victoria pushed him away, or Sveta did, or even Chris or Kenzie.</p>
<p>He could share with the group, but for many of the same reasons he couldn’t go to the Wardens, there would be a price. Things would change.</p>
<p>The person online&mdash; no guarantees.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada &mdash; she could offer support, she could help him ask others for help, but there was a limit to what she could do.</p>
<p>Erin repeated the question, calling it across to Rain.</p>
<p>A moment later, she put her book, down, holding her hand out. Telling him to wait.</p>
<p>“I’m okay!” he called out. He wasn’t.</p>
<p>Erin reversed direction and put her head out the window. In the background, one of her parents&mdash; her mom, it looked like, stepped into her room, standing behind her.</p>
<p>Rain raised a hand in a wave, and Erin’s mom waved back.</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to you tomorrow!” Rain called out.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Erin replied.</p>
<p>Rain adjusted his bag at his shoulder, then resumed the trudge. The false normal and the lie that he was okay was something that felt almost real, he could hold to it for a short while.</p>
<p>Not for the entire way back. When he did arrive at the edge of the property, with its hastily constructed house, the fenced in yard, and the stable, with a field stretching out behind it, the dread, at least, seemed less pointed.</p>
<p>The knowledge he might die sat heavily, all the same.</p>
<p>He let himself into the house and put his bag by the stairs. Everyone was in the kitchen. His uncle was looking over the paper from earlier in the day. Allie had a crossword and dictionary, and Rain’s aunt was engaged in what seemed like her neverending stream of tidying-up and tending to the property.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” his aunt said. “Did you eat?”</p>
<p>Rain shook his head.</p>
<p>“Food’s on the stove if you want it. If you don’t, let me know so I can put the leftovers away.”</p>
<p>Rain got a bowl from the cupboard and approached the stove.</p>
<p>“You look like lukewarm shit, Rain,” Allie said.</p>
<p>Rain’s aunt smacked Allie across the back of the head, hard enough that when Allie bent forward, she stayed like that for a few long seconds.</p>
<p>“He does,” Allie said.</p>
<p>“I probably do look like shit,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t mean she needs to say it,” Rain’s aunt said. She gave Allie a lighter slap on the back of the head, while Allie was still bent over her crossword.</p>
<p>Rain hadn’t yet ladled the stew into his bowl.</p>
<p>He couldn’t do nothing. He needed… As horrible as this situation was, as horrible as each new thing he learned seemed to make the situation, he needed to figure something out.</p>
<p>“Uncle,” he said.</p>
<p>He heard the papers rustle.</p>
<p>“Face your uncle if you’re addressing him,” his aunt said.</p>
<p>Rain did. His uncle was of average height, muscular as many of the farmers were, with graying blond hair that Rain’s aunt cut neatly every few days, and very tan, weather-worn skin. The man could have looked so normal and disarming, with a face that might even have looked friendly, but instead he wore a perpetual glower. He never smiled, and he rarely if ever spoke.</p>
<p>There was no light in his uncle. Had Rain not lived with the man for years, he might have said he was a sociopath, just in how he held himself, the look in his eyes, and how joyless his rote existence seemed. If the Fallen needed a job done and wanted able, loyal bodies, Rain’s uncle would go without question or hesitation.</p>
<p>“Would you teach me to fight?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to do that,” Allie said.</p>
<p>“Butt out, Allie,” his aunt said, hand going up but not delivering another smack. “This is between boy and man.”</p>
<p>Rain’s uncle folded his paper, then stood from his chair, putting it back under the table. He made his exit by the side door, entering into the fenced-in yard, the door left open behind him.</p>
<p>“What are you waiting for?” Rain’s aunt asked. “Don’t keep him waiting.”</p>
<p>Rain hurried, going back to the bottom stairs where he’d left his bag. He opened the bag as he reversed direction, heading to the kitchen, fishing in the bag for the things he needed.</p>
<p>He had one mechanical arm out as he passed his aunt and cousin. His aunt was unreadable. Not as dark as his uncle was&mdash; his aunt gave the impression the light had been almost entirely extinguished, but the woman could smile, for the rarest of occasions. She had things she cared about and prioritized. Dim or reduced to dark embers, but not gone.</p>
<p>He pressed the arm to his shoulder blade, and felt the connection flare, burning through his nerves to his brain. A small, tiny window opened in his consciousness, with his awareness of the arm and its position. He was aware of the air against the current that ran along the outside ‘skin’ of the arm and hand.</p>
<p>He used the extra arm to help hold the bag while he got the other arm out, slapping it back against the blade of his other shoulder.</p>
<p>His uncle waited by the wooden fence, the perimeter made up of only three broad wooden slats punctuated by the stout posts.</p>
<p>Standing there, illuminated only by the porchlight, his uncle gave no impression there had ever been a light there at all.</p>
<p>Rain had two more arms to connect, but they were smaller, attached at the elbow, only reaching as far as his wrist. They were older and he’d tuned them back up to working order with the intention of leaving one for Kenzie to study. He’d forgotten, in his haste to leave.</p>
<p>He approached his uncle. When he got within three or so paces, his uncle took a step toward him. No prelude, no intent apparent in his action. With a second long stride, the man reached out to shove Rain’s shoulder hard, pushing him toward the fence.</p>
<p>Rain cast out the emotion power around them, and felt the feedback buzz, the faint response that let him know the power was working.</p>
<p>That done, he reached up. His normal hand grabbed his uncle’s wrist. A mechanical hand grabbed his uncle’s elbow, fingers digging in there, in an attempt to force it to bend. The smallest hand grabbed for two fingers, pulling them backward.</p>
<p>His uncle pulled his hand up and away, and then kicked Rain in the thigh.</p>
<p>Rain fell, his mechanical hands were too slow to let go, and he could see as the two right arms came apart in pieces, wires stretching between wrist and forearm, forearm and elbow, before snapping. The individual parts fell to the shadows and grass.</p>
<p>His uncle kicked him while he was down, boot to ribs.</p>
<p>Rain reached for the pieces, picking them up with two left hands. The forearm, broken at the front, was almost like a broken bottle. He scrambled back, two broken pieces of his arms held in his real hand and his one remaining, full-size mechanical arm.</p>
<p>He dismissed the emotion effect, re-cast it out, just to ensure it was over his uncle. Not that it seemed to do much. He’d tried letting it sit on people and some of the farm animals before. It didn’t work. He could only hope there was some nuance he could use.</p>
<p><em>Fuck,</em> his ribs and leg hurt where he’d been kicked.</p>
<p>His uncle walked away, his back to Rain. He approached the fence, then reached over it. Allie wasn’t far away. She’d gone through the gate and was leaning against the outside of the fence, watching.</p>
<p>A shovel. Rain’s uncle had picked up the shovel that had been leaning against the fence, almost as long as Rain was tall, with a spade-shaped head. There was an implicit ‘if you’re going to wield a weapon, so am I’ to the act.</p>
<p>“Don’t kill him,” Rain’s aunt said, from the stairs to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Rain’s uncle turned, and gave Rain’s aunt a long, slow look.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to have to explain it to the leadership,” she said.</p>
<p>Rain’s uncle reversed his grip on the shovel, holding it near the spade-end with both hands.</p>
<p>Rain backed away a little as his uncle approached.</p>
<p>The first swing of the shovel was preliminary, measuring distance. Swung like a baseball bat, it made the ‘whoosh’ sound as it sliced through the air. If Rain hadn’t leaned back, it might have connected with his nose.</p>
<p>Rain lunged forward. He had smaller weapons.</p>
<p>His uncle didn’t swing the shovel back the other way. Instead, moving his hand up to grip it at the middle, he swung it so the upper end caught Rain’s mechanical arm, the lower end caught his wrist.</p>
<p>The mechanical arm broke with the impact, the shattered forearm dropping from its grip.</p>
<p>Rain felt the pain of the impact against his wrist as something that extended along his entire forearm, through his hand, tingling in his fingers.</p>
<p>He knew how to throw a punch, and with his uncle holding nothing back, he had no reason to do so either. He closed the distance, his chest connecting with his uncle’s as he punched low, aiming for the stomach, just beneath the ribs. Repeated blows, strikes with fist sharp against muscle and fat.</p>
<p>Fingers tangled in his hair, gripped tighter until Rain’s scalp hurt. He was pulled away, then without the hand letting go, he was flung into the fence, cheekbone and shoulder crashing into the broad plank closer to the top.</p>
<p>He was pulled away, not allowed to get his balance, and then thrust toward the fence again.</p>
<p>He used his mover power to arrest the push, to make himself stop. He drove his elbow into his uncle’s arm, where only the connection pad and the shattered remnants of the arm remained, raking the damaged metal and wire against flesh.</p>
<p>His uncle pulled away, and Rain was there, suspended for another second.</p>
<p>Rain couldn’t cancel out his mover power before his uncle got his footing and came back at him, driving a knee into his middle. He crashed into the fence and landed hard.</p>
<p>He hauled himself to his feet, one hand on the fence, and his uncle kicked him before he was entirely there. A kick at the armpit, so Rain’s hand couldn’t support him any longer. His mover power wasn’t available to stop him from falling, and&mdash; and it wouldn’t have mattered in the slightest if it were.</p>
<p>The pain radiated through him, now. His uncle stood tall, one hand at his arm, which was bleeding, and paced. The feedback Rain got wasn’t accurate enough to let him know where his uncle was, and it was hard to find a position where he could look up and over.</p>
<p>He grabbed the fence and heaved himself to his feet.</p>
<p>His uncle looked at his aunt, and Rain took that as an opportunity to sprint full-bore for the man. He leaped, heedless of personal risk, of the fall that might follow, and kicked sideways with all of his force.</p>
<p>He connected, shin to side. He saw the pain on his uncle’s face. Then he used his power to suspend himself, before he could tumble hard to the ground.</p>
<p>It suspended him for too long. There was no canceling it, and however long it lasted, a second and a half, two seconds, maybe even approaching three seconds, it was enough time for his uncle to turn his way and kick him, hard.</p>
<p>Rain dropped, in too much pain to calculate how he broke free of the power’s hold, and landed in the grass and dirt.</p>
<p>He was kicked several times while he was down. Back, buttock, leg. He wasn’t sure if he’d been kicked sharply in the side or if it was only the way he’d recoiled and made an existing wound pull that made it feel like it.</p>
<p>His mechanical hands broke at the slightest excuse, his emotion power didn’t do anything he could identify, and his mover power made him a sitting duck in any real combat situation.</p>
<p>The kicking had stopped. Rain lay there, his breaths coming out as wheezes. His thoughts were so mired in sick hopelessness that he could barely think straight.</p>
<p>A hand was extended. It seized Rain by the upper arm, firm, and heaved him to his feet.</p>
<p>It occurred to Rain, too late, that his uncle wasn’t the kind of person to offer a helping hand.</p>
<p>Still firmly holding Rain’s upper arm, with Rain bent over, his uncle struck him across the face. It was only the fierce grip on Rain’s arm that kept him from being knocked to the ground yet again.</p>
<p>Again, Rain was struck across the face. His head sagged.</p>
<p>The next hit caught him backhanded, across the ear. It was impossibly loud, painful, and it made his thoughts dissolve into sparks. His ear rang like a siren in the wake of the hit.</p>
<p>Rain, almost insensate, punched in the general direction of his uncle’s stomach, turned his face toward the ground so it would be away of any further blows, and kept punching blind until his uncle let him go.</p>
<p>Rain stumbled back, snorted, coughed, and tried to straighten, before giving up on the latter. He put his hand on his knee to steady himself.</p>
<p>His uncle approached, and Rain backed up. His uncle’s turn to return the favor, now. Swats, a knee, a punch, a shove. Even the lighter contact was painful, because Rain hurt, and each light contact forced him to move one way or the other while existing bruises and injuries punished those movements.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain managed, huffing out the word. “Stop.”</p>
<p>His uncle didn’t stop, pushing out with both hands to shove Rain back into the wooden fence.</p>
<p>With an edge of desperation, Rain pulled out the silver blades. It didn’t make his uncle hesitate.</p>
<p>He threw the first blade, and the pain at his armpit altered the trajectory, meant he didn’t finish the swing. The silver scythe passed through his uncle’s head, the two remaining pieces carrying forward, sailing out to strike the side of the house.</p>
<p>A silver line encircling his head, Rain’s uncle stood there, drawing in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain said. He hunched over, hands on his knees, coughed, then snorted. “Don’t sneeze or do anything. That’s all. Thank you.”</p>
<p>His uncle remained where he was, glowering, eye sockets only barely illuminated by the silver light from the mark.</p>
<p>The mark would fade soon. Ten, twelve seconds. Rain watched and waited, nervous of the possibility of disaster.</p>
<p>The silver line thinned out, went away. Rain’s uncle touched his face. A moment later, the man strode toward Rain, a dark look on his face.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Rain said, voice weak. He realized the futility of it as he said it. His uncle didn’t intend to stop until one of them was unable to move.</p>
<p>The other blade still in his hand, he threw it out, with the blade only traveling a matter of feet before it crossed through his uncle’s midsection, the vertical and horizontal lines of the plaid work shirt illuminated in the gloom.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Rain said, again. “Or you’ll die.”</p>
<p>His uncle looked down, spreading his hands.</p>
<p>Then, his expression changing, the man looked skyward, sighing. Rain took the twelve seconds of rest to try to gather his thoughts, not looking skyward, but toward the ground. He&mdash;</p>
<p>Heedless of the mark, his uncle kicked him. The force was such that the silver mark flared, and it cut what lay beneath.</p>
<p>Again and again, the man kicked Rain. He stomped once, as Rain lay too close to the ground to be properly kicked.</p>
<p>“I think he learned whatever it is you wanted to teach him,” Rain’s aunt said. “Why don’t you come inside? I’ll make you tea, and I’ll look over those scratches.”</p>
<p>Rain waited, knowing that if his uncle decided to ignore the order, there would only be more pain. Pain that could kill him, if it meant he wasn’t able to fight back when Snag, Cradle, and Love Lost came for his head.</p>
<p>Instead, fabric draped over Rain’s head.</p>
<p>“Replace it,” his uncle said. Perhaps the eleventh and twelfth words Rain had ever heard the man say to him.</p>
<p>Rain reached up and pulled the fabric away. The plaid shirt. Sliced across the middle. His uncle was fine, because&mdash;</p>
<p>Because, Rain realized, closing his eyes, the power only affected one thing at a time. It would hit clothes first, the person second.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to watch as his uncle walked away, wearing an undershirt and jeans, opening the door to the kitchen and closing it behind him, the light in the fenced-in yard diminishing with the door closed.</p>
<p>Rain lay there, trying to breathe, hurting from head to toe.</p>
<p>“Dad doesn’t even have powers,” Allie said, from the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>Rain winced, realizing she’d seen. She was still there.</p>
<p>“You did better when you weren’t using your powers,” his cousin said. She paused. “You okay?”</p>
<p>Rain’s nose felt stuffed, every heartbeat making his entire nasal cavity pound. He snorted, hard, and pain ripped through his skull, blood spraying the grass in front of his face. He huffed out a breath.</p>
<p>“I’m&mdash;” he started. “Fine.”</p>
<p>He was going to die. Not here, not because of this. But he was going to die.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what you were expecting,” Allie said. “Dad is the kind of guy who thought he’d teach five year old me how to swim by throwing me into a pond. I think this is him applying that same principle to teaching you to fight.”</p>
<p>Rain huffed out a breath. His ribs hurt like hell, but&mdash;</p>
<p>He drew in a deep breath, winced at the pain.</p>
<p>Not broken. He’d had broken ribs before.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you were around then, but when mom had cancer, it was just dad and me and a couple cousins in the house. He’d do stuff like tell us to sweep, and if we didn’t sweep right, he’d give us the belt. He wouldn’t even tell us what we did wrong or why we didn’t meet expectations. We had to figure it out.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” Rain managed. “I was there.”</p>
<p>“Then why the hell did you think this was a good idea? There are other people you can ask. That you <em>have</em> been asking, unless you’ve been lying to us. You could have gone to them.”</p>
<p>“I could have. I wanted&mdash;” Rain coughed. “I wanted this.”</p>
<p>“This? Oh, you’ve gone and lost your mind.”</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em>, Rain thought. Maybe he had. He’d fit right in, if he had. But he’d wanted, <em>needed</em> to know if, when he was desperate and in very real danger, there was anything he could pull out or do.</p>
<p>There wasn’t.</p>
<p>“You sure you don’t need help?” Allie asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll manage,” Rain said, his voice coming out strained. He fumbled out with one hand, reaching for the fence.</p>
<p>It took him some time to get to his feet. He ended up leaning against the fence, hugging it, while trying to breathe properly.</p>
<p>He was pretty sure the dread and emotion in him was enough that he could have thrown up if he’d tried to. He was also pretty sure he would black out if he did.</p>
<p>A truck roared as it rolled down the dirt road, moving too fast in the dark. That would be why Rain walked on the side of the road when he walked that way in the dark.</p>
<p>“Rain,” Allie said.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“I know we’re not close. I’ve probably been shitty to you.”</p>
<p>“Better than a lot of people,” he said.</p>
<p>“I mean I’m not in a position to ask any favors from you,” she said.</p>
<p>Leaning over the fence, still hugging it, he stared down at the dark grass on the other side. He didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“But I really, really need you to get your shit together,” his cousin said.</p>
<p>He winced, closing his eyes. He opened them almost immediately, because he worried he might black out.</p>
<p>“You’ve turned some heads and drawn a lot of attention,” Allie said. “You managed to do something nobody really thought was possible. You put a rung on the ladder that’s even lower than the unpowered. The person with powers that suck. Because if you have shit powers, you’re not going to trigger and get <em>other powers</em>. You have no chance.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. He barked out a couple of coughs, feeling a stabbing in his sides with each one.</p>
<p>“I really, <em>really</em> need you to figure something out,” Allie said. “If you need something from me to help you figure it out, I can try helping. But I need you to be… <em>not</em> <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>He focused on breathing, absorbing the words.</p>
<p>“You know why I’m asking, right?”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly, mindful of the throbbing headache, pounding in his ear, and his sinuses. He wasn’t sure if she could see him in the gloom.</p>
<p>“Nobody really wants you as a husband for their daughter, or as a husband for them. They’ll go through the motions but they don’t want you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Sooner or later, they’re going to get fed up with you. Then they’ll try pairing you up with someone and getting some babies out of you, see if those kids end up being worth anything in a few years. When they do, nobody’s going to jump at the chance to be with you or marry their kid to you.”</p>
<p>Rain winced, tried to stand straighter.</p>
<p>“They’ll look back and forth and everyone will avoid eye contact, and then their eyes will settle on my mom and dad. They’ll pair me up with you, because that’s who mom and dad are. They’re dutiful, and they’ve sunk so much into this that they aren’t going to stop believing anytime soon.”</p>
<p>He knew it to be true. He’d worried about it.</p>
<p>“And don’t go thinking of Erin. I know you like her. I know you probably hold out some secret hope you’ll get paired up with her.”</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you do. Everyone probably does. She’s <em>hot</em>. But it’s because she’s hot that she’s going to end up with some forty year old guy close to the leadership, or she’s going to run. Give up on her now. If you don’t, I won’t just be the pity incest wife, I’m going to be the pity incest wife with a heartbroken husband.”</p>
<p>“You could leave.”</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks they’ll leave if it looks like they’re going to get a bad pairing. How many actually do? When things are close to that point, they start keeping a closer eye on you. You get asked to have a chat with the leadership. They don’t leave you the choice.”</p>
<p>Rain used the fence to help himself stay upright as he limped toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be one of the idiots that thinks she can get away,” Allie said. “I’m making peace with it.”</p>
<p>He paused as he saw the shadows of his destroyed tinker arms.</p>
<p>Slowly, he began working his way toward the ground, so he could pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>“Stop,” Allie said. “It’s painful to watch you. Let me.”</p>
<p>He let her.</p>
<p>She hopped the fence, walked over to the shadows, and bent down, feeling out for the pieces and picking them up.</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to zap me or anything, is it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t&mdash;” Rain paused. “Don’t touch the oblong pieces, the thin ones. Hold them by the stems with the wires, or the shoulders.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Gingerly, Allie collected most of the pieces. She handed them over to Rain. He took the contact pad that had ripped away and switched it off before gathering it into his arm with the torn shirt.</p>
<p>Allie gave him the last piece, then kept her hand on top of it.</p>
<p>“Figure it the fuck out, Rain,” she said.</p>
<p><em>I’ll die, I’ll get killed by my cluster, and I won’t be a concern for you anymore</em>, he thought, staring into the little dots where her eyes were reflecting the distant fire.</p>
<p><em>I’ll die</em>, he thought. <em>I can’t fight my unpowered uncle. How can I fight… all of that?</em></p>
<p>“I’ll try,” he said.</p>
<p>The door opened. Rain’s aunt.</p>
<p>“Allie, there you are. Inside. Get the bigger first aid kit from the basement. I want to patch up your dad’s cuts, and the smaller kit doesn’t have any bandages.”</p>
<p>Allie turned to go, obedient.</p>
<p>“If you want first aid, Rain, knock on the master bedroom door, or go straight to Allie. She’ll tend to you. For now, get yourself to bed. You’re coming to church in the morning.”</p>
<p>Rain swayed slightly on the spot, then said, “Okay.”</p>
<p>The door closed behind his aunt.</p>
<p>He got to his bag and dumped the pieces of the arm into it. Picking it up, he made his way inside. The stew had been put away. No dinner.</p>
<p>He went up the stairs and into his room. He settled in at his desk. The day’s homework was on the table, waiting to be done.</p>
<p>Slowly, he set out the pieces of his tinker hands.</p>
<p>Days worth of work.</p>
<p>No secret to be uncovered, no use he hadn’t yet figured out. Not legs, not claws.</p>
<p>This, these fragile things, they were the only things that came to mind when he reached out for his tinker power. Between ten and thirty minutes passed while he found all the smaller pieces, setting them in the right places. He had some wire and tools on his desk, and he got them out. To start with, he would fix everything he could fix in five seconds. Then he would move on from there.</p>
<p>The spell was broken as his alarm clock buzzed. He always set it for the evening, not the morning, because there was a timeframe.</p>
<p>He started to rise to his feet, but he’d been sitting still too long, while hurt too badly. His body refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>With inching progress, he made his way toward the alarm clock.</p>
<p>“Rain!” his aunt called out from the other room. “Shut it off!”</p>
<p>Inching progress, shuffling steps.</p>
<p>He made it to the alarm clock, but not to the bed.</p>
<p>Rain’s consciousness was snuffed out like a candle.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p><em>Cradle</em>.</p>
<p><em>His dreams are strange</em>.</p>
<p>A hand slamming down on the table, a paper beneath it. A mouth opening. A man that might have been Cradle’s father spoke, but it wasn’t words that came out. It was the frantic cries of the crowd, the screams, the shouted jumble.</p>
<p>The paper crumpled slightly as the hand on it closed into more of a fist.</p>
<p>In the background, a very prim and proper woman stood with her back to Cradle.</p>
<p><em>The parents</em>, Rain interpreted. <em>Disappointment and anger. I can understand that.</em></p>
<p>The scene changed. A balding man in a suit, sitting across from a desk. The bulletin board behind him had child’s artwork on it.</p>
<p>His expression was plaintive, worried. The words from that somber older man’s face were the scream of someone that had been burned, stopping as lips closed together, starting as they parted. His hand moved more papers, sorting through the pile in front of him.</p>
<p>Cradle’s point of view moved, shaking left and right as he shook his head.</p>
<p>The balding older man’s expression changed from worry to something stronger. Upset. Deep concern.</p>
<p><em>The principal</em>, Rain interpreted. He’d seen variations on this. It was usually like this, or else smoke, rubble, or broken glass poured from people’s mouths instead of words. <em>Cradle wasn’t doing so well?</em></p>
<p>He could understand that too.</p>
<p><em>It’s even of a similar vein. Unrealized potential, as far as I can understand it. Report cards, teachers, father figures, they want something from him and he doesn’t deliver. He doesn’t hand it over.</em></p>
<p>Then the long hallway. The trudge. Cradle’s hand was visible as he reached up to fix his glasses, as he reached out to the window. In the distance, far away, the sounds of disaster could be heard. The stampede, the fire.</p>
<p><em>School again? A lonely hallway? Isolation? I used to call him the recluse.</em></p>
<p>Cradle took off his glasses, and all was a blur. When he put them back on, he was facing teenaged peers.</p>
<p>Their faces moved as if they were shouting, expressions twisting. The only sound to come out was that of the stampede. Feet tromping, people shouting with words blending into one another. Teeth came together as a word was finished, and the sound was of a bone breaking. One of the teenagers pushed Cradle down. His glasses were set ajar by the fall.</p>
<p>This time, as he fixed the glasses, he was in the shopping center, standing.</p>
<p>Things moved as if in slow motion. Inevitable.</p>
<p><em>What does Cradle feel when he’s here? Dread?</em></p>
<p>Cradle’s head turned, everything moving as if it was underwater, as he looked at a group of men and women with tattoos. They were loud, too loud, as they gathered together, talking among themselves.</p>
<p>He looked the other way. He saw other faces. Faces that would be in the crowd shortly. A couple that were about thirty years old. Then an older man and woman.</p>
<p><em>The old couple get trampled early on</em>, Rain thought.</p>
<p>Eyes roved slow-motion in the other direction. In a store with colorful graphic images in frames, and other things in glass cases, a big guy with long hair, a nose ring and an impressive beard was talking to an older man, while tapping one of the framed cartoon images. No sound came out of his mouth as his lips moved.</p>
<p>Images like this would be the best Rain would get at seeing Snag’s face uncovered.</p>
<p>There were others. The twelve year old girl with her friends, that Snag would fail to help. She would die in the crush, after slipping from Snag’s grip.</p>
<p>A lot of the children and elderly in the mall would be counted among the dead.</p>
<p>One of the three girls said her goodbye to her friends. The movement was slow motion as she ran across the plaza of the mall.</p>
<p>She was smiling as she approached the woman who waited for her. The smile fell from her face, she slowed, then hung her head.</p>
<p>The woman showed the girl her watch, tapped it, her words were stern and entirely unheard. There was only silence in this slow motion prelude to the event.</p>
<p>The woman with wavy red hair, a sweater that failed to hide her impressive chest, and an ankle-length skirt. Heads turned to watch her berate the child. The child looked nervously back at her friends.</p>
<p>Love Lost.</p>
<p>Things accelerated, as the scene rushed forward. Everyone to their positions.</p>
<p>Three explosions in quick succession, loud after the silence, the blasts tearing across the plaza the opening of one of the exits. Blue flame.</p>
<p>Then the movement, everyone trying to get away. The layout of the shopping center allowed only one good escape route, and everyone rushed for it.</p>
<p>Another acceleration, skipping ahead in time. The sound of the stampede, the crowd, all of the noises that had been made or hinted at earlier, now came to the forefront, <em>crashing</em> into the present moment. Cradle was close to the front of the crowd. He was shoved, he tried to catch his balance, and he fell. His glasses came away from his face, they were stepped on.</p>
<p>Twice, he reached for the glasses, and his hands were stepped on. There was a desperation in it, more of a struggle to get them than there was even an attempt to stand. The scene was blurred but his hands were as clear as anything.</p>
<p>Close by, a woman screamed, and the sound was prolonged, multi-part.</p>
<p>He found his glasses and put them to his face with bleeding fingers. He was kicked, stepped on.</p>
<p><em>Did I subconsciously take myself there?</em> Rain thought.</p>
<p>He reached up, hand extended.</p>
<p><em>Pleading for help, reaching and unanswered,</em> Rain interpreted.</p>
<p><em>How did all of what came before lead into this?</em></p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Rain was in the room. He picked up the chair.</p>
<p>He didn’t venture a response. He knew what the answer would be.</p>
<p>He didn’t really want to face the others, either. They were the people who wanted him tortured to death.</p>
<p>For now, he sat in the chair. There was no reason to stand. He didn’t even need to find his three tokens. It wasn’t as if he was giving them away, or getting anything.</p>
<p>His power would be what it was.</p>
<p>Snag approached the table, clearing away the debris, finding his glass. He turned to stare at Rain.</p>
<p>Rain wanted to answer that stare, wanted to provoke. He stared across to Cradle’s space instead. He breathed deep, none of the injuries from earlier present. They appeared as they were, in a way. Snag in the same sorts of clothing, partially hiding his appearance, never looking like he’d just come from work. Cradle wore civilian clothes. Love Lost…</p>
<p>Love Lost rose from the chair. Still wearing the muzzle-mask, still wearing the dress with the slit up the side, the heels, her nails painted. She never took off the mask, now, so it was enough of a part of her to be brought into this space.</p>
<p>Her eyes were downcast as she approached the dais and gripped the edge. She only lifted her eyes to stare Rain down. Abject hatred.</p>
<p>It felt like an hour passed before Snag spoke.</p>
<p>“Cradle. I’d like the coins before we run out of time.”</p>
<p>Cradle came from around the corner of one of the concrete slabs. He looked worse for wear.</p>
<p><em>It’s always harder when it’s your night</em>, Rain thought.</p>
<p>Cradle found the coins, gripped them in one hand, and slammed the hand against the invisible barrier that separated his section from Snag’s. Snag caught one out of the air before it could hit the floor. The other two landed on the flat surface of the dais.</p>
<p>“You know what the shittiest part of this thing is?” Cradle asked.</p>
<p>Cradle always liked to talk on his nights.</p>
<p>“You <em>infected</em> us,” Cradle said, looking at Rain. “We each got a piece of each other.”</p>
<p>“Bleed-through,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“So you’ve done some research,” Cradle said. “We were pretty decent people before. Love Lost yelled at her daughter, but&mdash;”</p>
<p>Love Lost’s hand slammed against the dais.</p>
<p>“But she wasn’t <em>evil</em>,” Cradle said. He turned to Love Lost. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>Love Lost glared at him.</p>
<p>“Snag was even a bit of a hero,” Cradle said.</p>
<p>Snag sighed. “I don’t really think so.”</p>
<p>“The girl you helped? Friend of Love Lost’s daughter? Come on,” Cradle said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Snag said, looking away.</p>
<p>“We were decent people,” Cradle said. “And now we’re not. Because of <em>you</em>. Because you’re infecting us.”</p>
<p>Rain looked away.</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said. “I don’t want any piece of you in me. Just… wake up and kill yourself. You can’t be happy with the Fallen. So just end it. Kill yourself. Everything becomes easier.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to do that, and I’m not with the Fallen,” Rain said. “Not anymore.”</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said. “At least that way it’ll be easy.”</p>
<p>“Are you listening to me?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said. “If you don’t, then some time, maybe a month from now, maybe a year, we’ll come for you. We’ll take all of that ugliness you gave us and we’ll <em>give it back.</em> With interest.”</p>
<p>The coins rattled in Snag’s hand.</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said.</p>
<p>Love Lost’s fingernails clicked against the top of the dais.</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said.</p>
<p>The fingernails clicked.</p>
<p>Rain stood, turned with his back to the dais, venturing further into his section of the room.</p>
<p>A bang made him turn. Cradle had slammed his hand against the dais.</p>
<p>“Pay attention,” Cradle said. “And kill yourself.”</p>
<p>“You think I’m going to listen to you?” Rain asked. “Because you say it over and over?”</p>
<p>“I think if I say it often enough, there’s a chance it’ll catch you when you’re weak. It could cross your mind at a critical time. It’s a small chance, maybe, but I’m not doing anything else with the rest of my night. I could keep it up tomorrow night, or the night after. I could come up with something else.”</p>
<p>Nails clicked against the dais.</p>
<p>“Kill yourself,” Cradle said.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The church service concluded. The speakers rotated on the regular, and today’s was Mrs. May. She was a respected figure in the community, but she wasn’t <em>respectable</em>. She was a harpy of a person, with a shrill voice and a grating laugh she was inclined to use at the slightest provocation, and most people either loved her and her rhetoric, or they despised her. She performed a lot of sermons, usually with plenty of warning to others and often with women in attendance. Much of what she said appealed to that crowd.</p>
<p>Rain took some small solace in the fact that because his aunt and uncle had made him come, they had been obligated to sit through this. They weren’t part of Mrs. May’s sub-congregation.</p>
<p>He wanted nothing more than to go, to get to his workshop, and to do what little he could to prepare. As he made his way to the door, however, his aunt was caught up in a conversation with one of Mrs. May’s group. Oh, wasn’t the sermon so delightful? The word choice here, the passage, wasn’t it perfect? Rain was here, that was unusual, was Rain married off yet? No? What about Allie? Surely Allie had suitors.</p>
<p>Different preachers to appeal to different crowds, with diehard adherents attending <em>every</em> sermon. It didn’t matter that the ideas contradicted, that the sermon the nervous Reverend Patman gave to a small congregation of Mrs. Sims’ type was the polite kind of message that could be heard elsewhere, while the inappropriately dressed Mrs. May preached how wives had the duty of keeping their husbands’ balls drained, prostates massaged, and stomachs full.</p>
<p>The people who wanted to believe believed, and Mrs. Sims’ type stayed because… Rain wasn’t entirely sure. Because there was a safety in madness, maybe. Part of why he stayed, really. Or because leaving and trying to forge a life elsewhere was harder than staying and ignoring the ugliness and contradiction. Harder than lying to herself and thinking she could bring order to this chaos.</p>
<p>Rain walked through the door to the overcast outside. Allie joined him, her eyes widening slightly in the only communication she would give him that she didn’t agree with the sermon or the crowd.</p>
<p>“Hi Allie,” a guy said. He was about eighteen, his tousled blond hair was grown out, and he had a natural smile with a mouth that seemed too wide.</p>
<p>“Hi,” Allie said, shy. She looked down.</p>
<p>“Hi Rain. You look like you went to war and you fought your way through the entire enemy line.”</p>
<p>“Hi Lachlan. I think that might just be the politest way anyone could describe this,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Lachlan chuckled.</p>
<p>“You guys are just… hanging out here?”</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for a ride,” Allie said. “I think Rain would rather get a ride than walk, after fighting through that battlefield you described.”</p>
<p>“I can give you guys a ride,” Lachlan offered.</p>
<p>“No thank you,” Allie said. “You’re a dear, but I’ll just wait for my parents.”</p>
<p>Lachlan twisted his head around. “They’re caught in conversation with the Screeching Mimis.”</p>
<p>“Shh! Lachlan!” Allie shushed him. Some heads had turned.</p>
<p>Lachlan grinned. “I’m just saying, they’re going to be a while. Once those four get their hooks in, people can’t get away for half an hour or more, and with your parents not being regulars, there’s a lot to catch them up on.”</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate my mom and dad,” Allie said. “We’re stern stock.”</p>
<p>“I will keep that in mind,” Lachlan said, smiling like he’d been let in on a secret. He looked at Rain. “You want a ride?”</p>
<p>Rain looked at Allie.</p>
<p>“Go,” she said. “It’s embarrassing being seen next to you when you’re this beat up.”</p>
<p>“What?” Lachlan asked. “Be fair, come on. Rain’s one of the esteemed. He’s blessed with power. He’s like nobility around here.”</p>
<p>“Bastard nobility, maybe,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You’re blessed,” Lachlan said, voice firm. He smiled, then said, “And I’m your humble, obedient servant that would be glad to take you anywhere you want to go. I’m at your service.”</p>
<p>Rain glanced again at Allie. “If you could give me a ride to the machine shop, I’d be grateful.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Bye Allie.”</p>
<p>“Bye.”</p>
<p>Lachlan led Rain to his car. It was a nice one, a sleek blue sedan, roughly five years old, and in near-pristine condition considering it had survived the end of the world. Rain got in the passenger seat with a wince and a grunt.</p>
<p>Every part of him hurt.</p>
<p>He could remember being in the room, the repeated words, and he dreaded tomorrow. Every moment that passed ratcheted up the dread.</p>
<p>Being hurt and facing a night like that magnified the fact that he didn’t feel <em>rested.</em> Even naps were beyond him, when his thoughts were this disturbed.</p>
<p>He looked over at Lachlan, and felt a twinge of sadness.</p>
<p>The car whisked its way along the road, slowing here and there to give a wider berth to the people walking on either side.</p>
<p>“You like Allie, huh?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>Lachlan laughed. “Yeah. It’s part of why I asked you if you wanted a ride. I’m at your disposal if you need anything at all, though. Don’t think I’m disloyal or selfish.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I sort of hoped I could give her a ride too and have a chat.”</p>
<p>“I guessed that too.”</p>
<p>“You know how I’m sort of the poster boy for the Fallen?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I’m eighteen, and I’m of a good age for marriage. They say I’ve really helped out, so I can have my pick of almost anyone. I made it really clear I don’t want anyone who doesn’t want me, and the leadership told me anyone I took would come to love me in time. That’s how it works.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“But I’d rather have someone who wants me, still. So I was wondering, you know…”</p>
<p>“If Allie was interested?”</p>
<p>“Do you think she is?”</p>
<p>“I could tell you,” Rain said. “But that’s only what I think. With something as serious and binding as marriage, you’d want to be <em>sure</em>. I can ask her outright, then pass it on to you.”</p>
<p>Lachlan chuckled. “Yeah?”</p>
<p>“If you want.”</p>
<p>“Now I’m nervous. Yes. Yes! She’s great, you know. There was a campfire a month ago&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You heard her playing guitar?”</p>
<p>“She sang. She doesn’t like singing because some of the others, like Jay&mdash; don’t think I’m disloyal…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Jay and some of the others make fun of her singing, or they join in and she hates that. But her singing is really nice. It was a small group, just a few of us, and we listened, and I think I fell in love with her right then. If I could listen to her sing for the rest of my life, I’d treat her like a queen.”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask her. I’ll tell her some of that, if you don’t mind it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Sure. I’m nervous now,” Lachlan said. “I was also wondering&mdash; she’s not necessarily the only one I’m considering.”</p>
<p>Rain’s heart sank.</p>
<p>“Do you know Nell?”</p>
<p>“I know Nell,” Rain said, feeling relieved. “Jay’s twin.”</p>
<p>“She has power too.”</p>
<p>“Do you like her?”</p>
<p>“I&mdash; she’s pretty, and she’s told me she’s interested.”</p>
<p>“But do you like her?”</p>
<p>“She told me she’s interested, and she’s close to the leadership. Do you know if I have to say yes?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Rain said. “I might not be the person to ask.”</p>
<p>“You’re the easiest to talk to.”</p>
<p>“If they told you that you can pick anyone… you can probably pick anyone. But Nell might not be a fan of yours afterward.”</p>
<p>Lachlan frowned.</p>
<p>“Let me ask Allie, on the down-low. Maybe if she says no, you go to Nell and act like she’s the first and last person you considered for a wife.”</p>
<p>“What if she says yes?”</p>
<p>“Then you would have to decide if having her at your side is worth possibly having Nell be upset with you.”</p>
<p>Lachlan huffed out a sigh.</p>
<p>“The machine shop is just down the block,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Thank you for talking to me,” Lachlan said.</p>
<p>Rain looked his way.</p>
<p>Lachlan’s hand adjusted its position on the steering wheel. His hand trembled a little in the moments where it wasn’t gripping the wheel.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Lachlan pulled the car to a stop. “Gotta ask you one more thing, if you don’t mind giving me a minute of your time.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Rain said. “You saved me more than a minute, so I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>Lachlan got out of the car as Rain did. In the time it took Rain to work his way to a standing position, Lachlan walked around the front of the vehicle to the side of the road and pulled off his t-shirt.</p>
<p>He turned so his back was to Rain. Rain, in turn, was faced with a tattoo. Words in bold letters, inches-high, shaded, with thick outlines. The first word was just below the nape of his neck, and the last was in the small of his back.</p>
<p>Jesus<br>
Virgin-Mother-Fucking<br>
Christ</p>
<p>Two hands, middle fingers extended, were on Lachlan’s shoulder blades, the fingers pointing up and outward. Each hand had a nail through the center.</p>
<p>“It’s new. What do you think?” Lachlan asked. He smiled as he turned to look at Rain over one shoulder.</p>
<p>“It’s big,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? It was hell to get it done. Shoulder blades and ribs especially, all in one session.”</p>
<p>“It’s… very high quality. I see a lot of bad tattoos around here, and that’s… the lines are straight, and the shading of the letters are good.”</p>
<p>“Then you like it? Awesome. You think Allie would like it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to speak for her. I can ask her.”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’ll show her. I see her at the bonfires a lot. Thanks,” Lachlan said. “I’ll see you around. If you need anything&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask.”</p>
<p>Lachlan grinned, and got back into his car.</p>
<p>Rain was left only with the deepest feeling of sadness. He was so tired, he ached all over, and his heart ached too. He wanted to tinker, and later, he would reach out to Erin. She would listen, he would give her a tempered version of how his days had been&mdash;</p>
<p>The machine shop was badly weathered, not well insulated, and existed primarily as a large shack, with two stories. It was where cars and pieces of equipment were brought to be repaired, with communal tools left for anyone to use.</p>
<p>The second floor, though, was mostly left to Rain. He winced with every step up, then let himself in.</p>
<p>He wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>Erin was already there, sitting with her knees to her chest, face buried in her arms.</p>
<p>Rain’s heart sank. A tiny, selfish part of himself bemoaned the fact that it didn’t stop. That he didn’t get to <em>rest</em>. It was threats to his life leading into him asking to be beaten to restless nights, church, <em>Lachlan</em>…</p>
<p>He wondered if that was the monstrous part of himself that he’d passed on to the others. The person he had been felt unrecognizable now, to the point he couldn’t even say what was <em>him</em> anymore.</p>
<p>Erin was crying. Clever, brave, beautiful, compassionate, caring Erin. Seeing her cry made him want to cry, more than anything else in the past twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>He had never seen her cry and he felt as terrified with the unanswered question of what had done this as he had felt with the threat of being tortured to death.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>She jumped slightly at the words. She hadn’t heard him come in?</p>
<p>“No,” she said. She blinked, and the blink squeezed out a tear. She looked away and wiped the tear away. “I’m sorry. I know this is your workshop, but I needed to get away.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. What happened?”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to know. He wanted to help her at the same time.</p>
<p>“I had a run-in with Tim,” she said. She swallowed hard.</p>
<p>Tim. Another of Rain’s uncles. Tim who was <em>Seir</em>, who wore the preserved head of a horse but was the furthest thing from the lithe, athletic form of the horse, and the furthest thing from the attractive form of Seir the demon, as was described in the book some of the preachers liked to recite from. Tim was forty, fat, ugly, and he had standing sufficient that he would run the settlement if the top two people in charge were somehow unable to.</p>
<p>A run-in with Tim. Rain had his suspicions about what had happened. That it had happened to <em>Erin</em>?</p>
<p>“I’d beat the shit out of him if I thought I could,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You look like you had the shit beat out of <em>you</em>,” Erin said. She blinked a few times, wiped away the tears. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t, and he couldn’t tell her he wasn’t. Not when she was this upset.</p>
<p>“I’m always a little bruised and scratched.”</p>
<p>“That’s more than bruises and scratches.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” Rain lied. “And you’re not. Can I do anything?”</p>
<p>As if that had brought everything back, Erin’s expression briefly crumpled up. She fixed it with apparent effort, and wiped away at more tears that had been squeezed loose.</p>
<p>She shrugged, and it was very, very apparent to Rain that she was trying to seem cavalier about something that wasn’t cavalier.</p>
<p>He had such a sick feeling in his chest, seeing this.</p>
<p>“Every time I cross paths with him, he makes comments,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. That’s&mdash; that’s Tim.”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “He told me I should go to church. Mrs. May is lecturing, I think?”</p>
<p>“She finished.”</p>
<p>“And he said Mrs. May could teach me what I needed to know to please a husband.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. If she was marrying <em>Tim</em>…</p>
<p>“I told him to go fuck himself.”</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. He saw her expression and looked away.</p>
<p>“I know it was stupid.”</p>
<p>“You can’t&mdash; he has a lot of power. It’s not that he’s right, but sometimes you have to keep your head down. Some of these people will <em>kill</em> you if you say the wrong thing. Or worse. Surviving is&mdash; it’s the most important thing.”</p>
<p>“I know,” she said. She averted her eyes. “I felt like I could, in the moment. There were people nearby. I&mdash; he pushed me up against a wall, he threatened me with some pretty vulgar stuff, with the crowd watching.”</p>
<p>“You need to get out of here,” Rain said. “You’re&mdash; you’re not Fallen. You’re decent. You’re kind. You <em>think</em>. You don’t believe this stuff. You don’t deserve this.”</p>
<p>“I can’t go,” she said.</p>
<p>“Because of Bryce? Your parents?”</p>
<p>“Of course because of them! You don’t understand!”</p>
<p>“I really don’t.”</p>
<p>“My parents are the good, decent people. If I have any good traits it’s because of them and how they raised me. They&mdash; they’re really kind, they were perfect. They tucked me in at night and they punished me fairly when I was wrong, they&mdash; they played with me and sat down to do my homework with me and they really truly <em>loved</em> me. They did everything right, they never embarrassed me.”</p>
<p>Rain stood there, taking that in. He tried to imagine what it was like.</p>
<p>“They&mdash; they talked to me and cared about what I had to say. They&mdash; they aren’t <em>this</em>.”</p>
<p>“They aren’t Fallen?”</p>
<p>“They aren’t! They’re… they’re scared. The world ended and they lost everything, we lost family and friends and everything they worked for, and they broke down a little. These people got their hooks in and my parents bought it. But they’re still the same people. They’ll turn around and realize how bad this is… won’t they?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Fresh tears spilled forth. She buried her face in her folded arms, brought her legs closer.</p>
<p>“You need to get out, save yourself first. Then you can try pulling them out.”</p>
<p>“I think if I do that, I’ll lose them forever,” she said, her voice muffled.</p>
<p>Rain wasn’t sure what to say.</p>
<p>He’d never really had family, certainly not like Erin had described.</p>
<p>Even if she lost them forever, at least she would be okay.</p>
<p>“My dad,” Erin’s voice was small, muffled.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“He was there, while Tim said all of that stuff. Bryce too. He just stood there. Then he apologized for my behavior.”</p>
<p>Rain was lost for words. He felt a tear well up and out and wiped it away before Erin could see.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“After Tim left, I freaked, and all my dad would say was that I shouldn’t have provoked him. He said I should go to church like Tim suggested. <em>My dad</em>, Rain. With Bry there.”</p>
<p>Rain reached out, then withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>“I can get a car,” Rain said. “I’ll borrow one, we can go for a drive. We’ll do whatever you want, find your favorite food, talk. Get away from this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go out there,” Erin said. “Not like this. Can I stay here? Please?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Rain said. Was it for the best? If she got in a car with him, he wasn’t sure he would be able to stop driving her away from this. He’d been born to this, but she hadn’t.</p>
<p>He still felt lost. He wasn’t sure what to do.</p>
<p>“Do you&mdash; can I give you a hug?” he asked.</p>
<p>She didn’t even answer. She rose to her feet, walked up to him, and wrapped her arms around him, face buried in his shoulder.</p>
<p>He put his arms around her. He’d never imagined such a thing could feel so horrible and harrowing. The horribleness didn’t even have anything to do with his injuries, that every point of contact hurt. It wasn’t his body that hurt.</p>
<p>Rain stared off into space, feeling much like he imagined the shell-shocked in war-zones to feel.</p>
<p>He thought of Cradle’s reaching out for help, people stumbling past him, knocking his hand away.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“Hello? Mrs. Yamada speaking.”</p>
<p>“It’s Rain. I’m&mdash; I’m really not doing great. Can we talk?”</p>
<p>“I thought you might call. Victoria and Sveta reached out to me. I’d planned to call you this afternoon to check on you. Listen, I’m expecting a patient shortly, and I can’t adjust that. We can talk for a few minutes, or, if it’s not an emergency, I can call you in an hour and a half, and I can give you a lot more time.”</p>
<p>“Please,” Rain said. “The second one.”</p>
<p>“Be easy on yourself, Rain. I’ll call you in an hour and a half.”</p>
<p>Rain hung up.</p>
<p>He’d reached out and there was a reach back.</p>
<p>He had that.</p>
<p>Erin was asleep on the other end of the room, on a makeshift bed, Rain’s spare change of clothes piled atop her as a kind of blanket. Her hand was under her pillow and her gun was in her hand. He wasn’t sure if she knew he’d seen her do it.</p>
<p>Cradle had described him as a monster. He wasn’t sure if he was, but as he sat at his work table, trying to work quietly, he imagined he was willing to become a little more monstrous if it meant saving the likes of Erin from becoming a lost soul like Lachlan.</p>
<p>His tinkering might have been limited, but he had other skills. He’d survived in places more rustic than this for a time. He could make blades. He could make traps and snares. His scrap with his uncle had taught him he couldn’t win a fair fight against even the unpowered, not with his powers being what they were.</p>
<p>He’d draw on every resource he had to keep it from coming down to a fair fight. When he went back to the group tomorrow, it would be with a different mindset.</p>

<p>“Help me understand how this makes any sense at all,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>We were outside of a bagel place, close to the station nearest the Wardens’ Headquarters. Natalie had bought a salad with chicken bits in it. I’d never liked eating cold chicken, so I’d picked up a salad without the extras, and a toasted bagel sandwich with fish, black olives, tomatoes and cream cheese. We sat at a table outside.</p>
<p>Natalie was wearing a shirt with a folded collar under a work-suitable navy-blue sweater, with black slacks. I’d seen Kenzie wear a similar outfit a few days earlier, though Kenzie had had a skirt, and Kenzie had worn it better.</p>
<p>The group’s ‘lawyer’. She was just a student, but mom’s verdict was that she knew her stuff well enough to serve, and she had a good sense of what was happening in the future.</p>
<p>I explained, “The area we were surveilling had a team of heroes come through, at our urging. They had a brief interaction with the embedded villain population, suggested they might be sticking around, and then left.”</p>
<p>“And they were followed? By the entire group of villains?”</p>
<p>“By two, Hookline and Kitchen Sink,” I said. “They were angry following the discussion, were previously established as exceedingly violent, and they have criminal acts that are awaiting process.”</p>
<p>“They’re not in the nine percent?”</p>
<p>“Is it nine, now? I was hoping the number would go up, not down.”</p>
<p>“Nine now,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“They aren’t. I think most of the villains in Cedar Point are trying to stay clear of that line,” I said. I took a bite of my sandwich, then wiped the cream cheese from the corner of my mouth with a flick of my thumb. Thoroughly disappointing.</p>
<p>Nine percent. I’d known it as the ten percent, which had been a neater, rounder number. With the courts badly behind, only a certain number of crimes and criminals were being rushed through court, and it wasn’t based on the time of the deed. There was something which might have resembled a balance right now, but it was slipping fast. People wanted to focus on getting themselves sorted out, there was plenty of work with reasonable pay, and the people who thought they could game the system ended up falling into the ten percent. For those who did, the hammer came down hard and decisively.</p>
<p>There was, however, a population of people who’d realized they could get away with things if they avoided being among the nine or ten percent worst offenders. It seemed to me that the gap was widening as people got more settled in and dissatisfied. I knew some areas were using a lottery system to deter the lesser criminals, choosing the crimes they’d act on and prosecute by drawing them at random.</p>
<p>“Do you and did you know the crimes these two have awaiting process?”</p>
<p>“Hookline dangled someone out of a fourth story window. Witnesses saw. He was presumed to be acting as collections for a money lender. The neighbors heard shouting about debt, not when Hookline was there, but in general, with the victim and his partner.”</p>
<p>“And you know this how, if it wasn’t pursued?”</p>
<p>“It was reported on in the paper for that area, a few months ago. I have a copy of the article on my laptop. I had to take the picture with my phone so it’s not the best. Do you want to see it?”</p>
<p>Natalie shook her head. “I’ll believe you.”</p>
<p>“After the article there was a reaction to Hookline. Some public gatherings, anger, some backlash against the money lender. Hookline left. No telling if he was made to, fired, or if he wanted something easier. Ended up at Cedar Point.”</p>
<p>“And the other one? Kitchen Sink.”</p>
<p>“One of a couple who worked under Beast of Burden, who was crime boss for New Haven. Sink handled collections for the protection racket.”</p>
<p>“Any serious crimes?”</p>
<p>“He trashed one business in a way that made it very clear his power was at use. He creates semi-random items and flings them around, and the business had a lot of semi-random items flung around, shelves trashed, windows broken.”</p>
<p>“Was anyone hurt?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” I said. “Victim didn’t pursue anything. Authorities aren’t going to do anything if the victim isn’t talking.”</p>
<p>Natalie’s forehead wrinkled. It was a weird contrast for someone who had a whimsical pixie cut with a curl at the front and oversized glasses, to seem as joyless as she did. She didn’t seem to like her meal, and she seemed interested but not excited or engaged by this.</p>
<p>I ate more of my bagel sandwich, letting her think. It would have been so much better if it was salmon, but it wasn’t. The olives were mushy and lacked bite, which made me wonder if they were old, scavenged, imitation, or if they’d lost something in transport. The worst thing was the bagel &mdash; I’d eaten here before and it had been better then.</p>
<p>“You assaulted and battered two individuals,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“Let me get my laptop out.”</p>
<p>“They didn’t make the first move, by your own admission.”</p>
<p>“Their intent was clear. They had weapons. I’ll show you the video.”</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>I fished my laptop out of my bag, packed up my bagel and set it aside, and set the laptop down so Natalie could see. It was a bit warm from being in my bag and being left on low-energy mode, but the boot-up was fast. I already had the pertinent files and videos in a folder.</p>
<p>“First video, overhead view. Do you have headphones?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>I waited until she had them out. She put them on, and I plugged in the jack. I hit the spacebar to start the video. She watched, putting her arm up and over the top of the screen, to shield it from the sun. I offered my own arm to help. The video came in at an angle, zooming in, and showed most of the conversation, followed by Hookline and Sink’s retreat.</p>
<p>When she started to take off her headphones, I held up a finger, then navigated to the second video. It showed same events, but a better view of Houndstooth’s group, and then expanded out to show how Hookline and Sink were closing in.</p>
<p>Natalie watched the fight and the follow-up, with Sveta and I retreating. Moose did the work of freeing Hookline from underneath the car I’d blocked in.</p>
<p>It was hard to see in the noonday sun, especially when I was half-standing, my arm out to help shade the screen, but I could see Hookline’s reaction, slapping away Moose’s hand. He stalked off, and Sink belatedly followed, something held to his bleeding nose.</p>
<p>“Clear intent to injure,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“That’s what I said. I did mention the weapons.”</p>
<p>“There’s a view, and it isn’t <em>my</em> view,” Natalie said, reaching for her salad, “that if you have a power then you’re armed at all times. Sometimes judges hold that view. I would rather assume that you would have a judge that held that perspective and be wrong, than to assume the opposite and be wrong.”</p>
<p>“Right,” I said.</p>
<p>“A better option would be to inform the heroes.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t. Clairvoyants with some clairaudience,” I said. I opened a sub-folder, clicked an image, and let it pop up. A boy in a wheelchair, a woman pushing it. He wore a helmet with a fake brain under glass at the top. She wore a bird mask. “They’d hear anything we communicated, so it was radio silence.”</p>
<p>“You could have dropped down in front of Houndstooth and told him about the situation.”</p>
<p>“Similar risk. We don’t want to hint at the prior relationship and we <em>do</em> want to suggest there’s a growing presence of heroes, to give them reason to second guess.”</p>
<p>Natalie sighed. “I’m not a very conservative person in reality, but I do think your situation needs a conservative eye.”</p>
<p>“I can agree with that,” I said.</p>
<p>“With a citizen’s arrest, there needs to be an actual arrest. I recognize you had to leave after the other villains showed up, but normally the process of performing an arrest like that needs clear indication of a crime in progress or one just committed, and it needs the authorities to be involved.”</p>
<p>“Citizen’s arrest?” I asked. “Capes get a lot more leeway with those.”</p>
<p>“One second. The process would be for you to contact me and contact the authorities, before anything happened.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to respond.</p>
<p>“Where possible, and it wasn’t possible here. I get that.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You would, with my counsel and go-ahead, step in, take action, and then wait for the authorities to arrive.”</p>
<p>“Authorities who are only acting on nine percent of the cases,” I said. “Why a citizen’s arrest and not an arrest with standing?”</p>
<p>“A costumed arrest? We don’t know for sure if they’re going to allow those with the new legal system. I’d rather lean on something tidier that we can be fairly sure will carry forward.”</p>
<p>I leaned back in my seat. “That’s a lot more conservative than I anticipated. Operating as if capes aren’t a thing?”</p>
<p>“I think capes are going to be a thing,” Natalie said. “But we have reason to believe they’re going to be a thing people are going to want to handle in a different, more careful way, now.”</p>
<p>I packed up my sandwich and pitched it into a nearby trash can.</p>
<p>“No good?” Natalie asked.</p>
<p>“Bagel was flavorless and textureless. It looked great and tasted… not like it looked.”</p>
<p>“They got popular, so they started freezing excess bagels and defrosting them to serve.”</p>
<p>I made a face.</p>
<p>“We’re making strides, Victoria, but I think we’re in for a culture shock when people realize that as much as they’ve been waiting eagerly for things to get closer to normal, we’re not going to get a lot of the old normal we’re eager for, and we’re going to get some of the less pleasant parts.”</p>
<p>“You’re talking about the law?”</p>
<p>Natalie shrugged. She was holding her plastic thing of salad, spearing some with a plastic fork. Before popping it into her mouth, she said, “Lots of stuff.”</p>
<p>My laptop was taking up some of her table real-estate, so I closed it and pulled it closer to me.</p>
<p>“Expectations,” she said, once she was done swallowing. “If I’m working with you, I need to know what yours are.”</p>
<p>“That’s a simple question with an answer that could take me a day to get through.”</p>
<p>“Your mom wanted me to ask you if you were still looking for work,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>I tensed a little.</p>
<p>“I was asked to ask the question and pass on the response if you gave it.”</p>
<p>“When we pay you, it’s not for you to be a messenger between me and my mom. If I want to talk to her I can call her.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Natalie said. “She had something else to pass on.”</p>
<p>“And I’m not interested,” I said, my voice firmer. “Thank you. I will get up and walk away.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t. Really, please don’t. There are a lot of things I want to talk about sooner than later,” she said. “During our last meeting, I know it was brief, but I wanted the lay of the land. I was hoping this meeting would be a chance to get a more comprehensive sense of what you wanted to do, and what I’m doing for you. Both of your mother’s questions tie into that.”</p>
<p>“Did you talk to her about our meeting?”</p>
<p>“No. Not for the last one. For this one, I went to someone lateral to her. She approached me independently with these things, and told me to reach out to you if you didn’t reach out anytime soon. Because you would want to know.”</p>
<p>I wished I hadn’t thrown my lunch away. I would’ve liked to have something to violently toss into the wastebasket, as an outlet for what I was feeling. I shook my head a little.</p>
<p>“It’s relevant,” Natalie said. “And it’s important. I promise.”</p>
<p>I shook my head more. All around us, people were going to and from lunch. There was actually a city-like stream of cars on the road toward the center of the megalopolis proper.</p>
<p>“Tell me then,” I said.</p>
<p>“There were two attempted breaches into our email server last night. It looked like it was directed at your mother. They put a moratorium on sending and receiving email for three hours while they did some backend stuff, and there was another attempted breach partway through that. Tech people are looking into it.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I looked at my laptop. Cedar Point, except I wasn’t aware of anyone who would be especially good at that stuff there. The speedrunners were tinkers, but nothing suggested they were tinkers with talents that translated to hacking into the email servers in the Wardens’ headquarters. Bitter Pill was a full tinker, but her specialty put her even further from that kind of operation.</p>
<p>Houndstooth appears, adding to pressure, Sveta and I make our appearance, and a little while later, an attempted look at a close relation’s emails. I could see the thread.</p>
<p>Would Tattletale have succeeded? If she had the power to see weaknesses, it could extend to security systems. During the bank robbery, she’d done <em>something</em> to gain access, though I couldn’t remember particulars. It had been ambient noise around then. She’d also collected info on Empire Eighty-Eight.</p>
<p>Someone they hired? Was the fact that they didn’t go straight to Tattletale important? A sign of a schism?</p>
<p>“My mother thinks it has something to do with me,” I concluded.</p>
<p>“She was called in for confidential discussion this morning, she got out of the meeting, said she couldn’t get in touch with you, and told me to reach out. I think so, yeah.”</p>
<p>“I can’t have you being her messenger. It’d impact how this arrangment works,” I said.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s pertinent? Letting you know things like the possible breach into emails? That they’re looking into people close to you?”</p>
<p>“The problem is that it’s always going to sound like a good reason.”</p>
<p>“Could it sound like a good reason because it is one? Sometimes, even?”</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath. I collected my laptop and put it into my bag.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave, please. I don’t want to drive you away. I do want to understand,” Natalie said. “The first and last thing I said at our last meeting was that I was concerned. I’m more concerned now.”</p>
<p>“Why ask me about whether I was looking for work?”</p>
<p>“Because she asked me to ask you, if I thought it was appropriate, and I thought it might be.”</p>
<p>“Of fucking course,” I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t get angry,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“I’m not angry with you.”</p>
<p>“Before we got derailed, I was talking about expectations. You flew into that scene with no hesitation.”</p>
<p>“I’m invincible,” I said. A lie, yes, but I wasn’t about to trust her with the truth.</p>
<p>“I know that, but isn’t there always some risk you’ll be hurt, or that there will be <em>some</em> consequence? You’re paying me, you’re involving your family, and the hack could be the tip of the iceberg. I have to wonder, how much are you putting into this?”</p>
<p>“I know my own limits, Natalie.”</p>
<p>“<em>Are</em> you looking for work?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to report to my mother and tell her if I’m not?”</p>
<p>“No,” Natalie said. “And I’m offended that you’d ask.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been pulling occasional shifts here and there doing cape work. Keeping the peace at protests, standing guard here or there, in the general vicinity of cape functions. I volunteer too.”</p>
<p>“Is the volunteer stuff as a cape?”</p>
<p>I sat back in my chair, and shifted the position of my bag. “Yeah. Pretty much.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like much of a balance.”</p>
<p>“You’re aware I’ve <em>never</em> had that balance?” I asked, in my best ‘get real’ tone.</p>
<p>“You went to high school once upon a time, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“As the girl that was an out and open superheroine,” I said. “Because of a decision my parents made.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen my dad in years. I don’t even know if he survived. I know what it’s like to have parent issues,” Natalie said. “I do get it. But is this really what you want? Your mother is concerned&mdash;”</p>
<p>I grit my teeth.</p>
<p>“&mdash;<em>I’m</em> concerned. I can definitely see the similarities between you two. You’re both firm in your convictions and it seems like you both give things your all. She’s usually the first one in and the last one out at work.”</p>
<p>“Can we stop talking about my mom?” I asked. Angrier than I’d intended.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Natalie said. She stopped there. “Give me a second. I’ll compose my thoughts.”</p>
<p>I gave her a few seconds. My ankle crossed over the other, and the top foot tapped against the ground. My fingers fidgeted with the strap of the bag that laid against my chair.</p>
<p>“I’m your lawyer. For you and your team.”</p>
<p>“Not my team. Just a team I’m looking after.”</p>
<p>“There’s an implication of overseeing and ownership, but okay. I’m the lawyer. I can give you counsel, and if I know who you are and who you want to be, I can tailor that counsel. My tendency is to be conservative, because there’s a lot we don’t and won’t know.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “There’s a degree to which I want conservative.”</p>
<p>“I hear you. I would <em>strongly</em> encourage something more lawful. Calling first, letting authorities know, checking with the lawyer, doing what you’ll do, working with authorities after.”</p>
<p>“Not every situation allows for that. Having a plan is great, and I’m all about laying stuff out and being smart about things. Sometimes there’s no time, and you have to make choices.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Natalie said. She paused, fixing her glasses. “Yes. If these are the three stages of the plan, with prelude, action, follow-up, <em>maybe</em> you can skip one, and you can explain it away to the authorities.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “That’s not unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“Except… If you have to skip two and rush the other, is it <em>possible</em> that you shouldn’t have acted at all?”</p>
<p>“We should have just let Houndstooth’s group get attacked from behind?”</p>
<p>“Or waited to send them in,” Natalie suggested. “Or not had them come in at all, if you couldn’t be sure you’d be able to handle the lead-in and follow-up.”</p>
<p>I drummed my fingers on the table. “There’s more to it. These guys are in contact with people. If we let them operate as normal, try to catch them in the act, they’ll use their leverage and catch us first. We have to apply some sustained pressure. Test their relationship with their contacts. We’ve talked it over with other groups and they agree it makes a degree of sense.”</p>
<p>“Houndstooth?”</p>
<p>“They were one. They really liked it, even.”</p>
<p>Natalie’s brow wrinkled. “You said sustained. Do you have more lined up?”</p>
<p>“A team is going to call a local realtor, looking into the possibility of moving in. We’ll see if they react.”</p>
<p>“Then?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We might have some more people lined up. Another group might be passing through, and we’ll be more ready if something comes up. My cousin is swinging by.”</p>
<p>More brow wrinkles. “You’ll pressure them until they crack.”</p>
<p>“Until they start to. Then we or someone we trust targets that weak point.”</p>
<p>“When things crack, it’s often sudden. Hook and Sink would be an example of that.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“If it’s sudden, it’s hard to take the necessary steps before and after,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“It could be,” I said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to give me an answer right now, but please think about what you want this to be. You can act faster and more flexibly if you’re loose with the law, but you’ll lose your chance at getting a big success past a judge’s desk. I can help you if that’s the route you need to go.”</p>
<p>“But you think we shouldn’t go that way.”</p>
<p>“The people on the team are young, so you need to think about what you’re teaching them. You need to think about your balance of real life and cape life.”</p>
<p>“I’m not&mdash;” I started. “I never got that. Even before I had powers, the cape life had taken over.”</p>
<p>“I can understand why you would resent her for that, but&mdash;”</p>
<p>“That’s not it,” I said.</p>
<p>She sat there, waiting like she was expecting me to elaborate.</p>
<p>I almost got angry. I pushed that back.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to get into particulars,” I said, calm. “It’s between me and her, and it would make things messy. Nobody benefits from that. Least of all you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll take your word for it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. “I’ll think about what you said. About what I want, what I’m doing, keeping an eye out for balance. The team and what they need.”</p>
<p>“The kind of counsel you need me to be.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said. “Absolutely. But I need something from you too.”</p>
<p>Natalie nodded.</p>
<p>“Don’t involve my mother in this. Don’t pass on information, give hints, or respond to hints. Lawyer-client confidentiality should be in effect.”</p>
<p>“I’m not a lawyer, exactly. I can and do intend to do that, absolutely, but&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Act like one, here. Please. She’ll convey her side of the story, probably not in an obvious way, and I need you to be neutral. I won’t be sharing my side, but assume I have one.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>“I can’t get into that stuff. I can’t afford to,” I said.</p>
<p>“She does care about you, you know,” Natalie said. “She might not handle it in the best way, I don’t know the details, but I know that she is smart and caring, and both of those things are magnified when it comes to you.”</p>
<p>I stared at her. My first thought was that I wanted to strangle her, because of the frustration I felt even <em>before</em> what I’d just said, her going against it, and how she seemed to not get it at all. Even with an absent parent? I wondered if it was something wholly different, like a parent that had left and cut contact of their own volition, rather than a parent that she’d cut herself off from.</p>
<p>My second thought was to tell Natalie what my mother had done, and to hope she understood. Even if I knew it would blow things up, cause chaos, screw up Natalie’s relationship with a superior.</p>
<p>I could see the worry on her forehead, as she looked at me. In that look, I could see that I was the bad guy here. I was the one Natalie thought she had to worry about, and my mother was the smart, capable, caring professional.</p>
<p>Anything I did in reaction to this would only make me seem more unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Thank you for meeting with me,” I said, pushing the emotion back, doing my best to sound normal. “Are phone payments okay?”</p>
<p>“They are,” Natalie said.</p>
<p>I took a minute to get everything sorted out, glad to have something to focus on, then tapped my phone against hers.</p>
<p>Sixty dollars out of my account. A glance at the screen verified my account standing. I had two hundred for rent to Crystal, seventy five for utilities. Even before any possible temp jobs in costume, I had enough to get through next month, two or three more meetings with Natalie or even fewer with anyone we replaced her with. Natalie was cheap and willing and I didn’t disagree with her non-family related advice. It made sense.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said. “And thank you for lunch.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see you later,” I said.</p>
<p>She was the pawn, not the problem. My mother had chosen her for a reason. A play of a sort, possibly unintentional or automatic. It wasn’t a play my mom had made because she was a mastermind, natural or otherwise. It was just how she was, how she navigated <em>people</em>. Everyone close to her had had to learn how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The tragedy was that as much as it was a conscious or unconscious bid for a reconnection with me, it would achieve the opposite.</p>
<p>I put my music on, and walked to the nearest bit of park so I could take off without causing too much of a commotion.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I let myself into the headquarters. I was secretly glad to find I wasn’t the first person in, seeing Kenzie at the desk, wearing the same clothes from yesterday.</p>
<p>As that fleeting sentiment passed, I was <em>alarmed,</em> seeing Kenzie at the desk, wearing the same clothes from yesterday.</p>
<p>“Kenzie?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh!” I heard her speak, though she didn’t move. Kenzie-at-the-desk winked out of existence.</p>
<p>“…Kenzie?” I tried again.</p>
<p>“I’m on my way!” she said, through the computer speaker. “I was hooked in by phone and forgot I had a virtual me set up to appear if I called. It’s only half done. I’ll be there soon! How are you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t dive too deep into the team stuff or tinkertech, Kenzie,” I said. “Take a break, turn off your brain every once in a while.”</p>
<p>“I turn off my brain by tinkering,” she said. “It’s like how on some computers you can push the number so high it goes back to zero, except it’s brain activity.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” I said. “Put the phone away. Close your eyes. Don’t fuss about things.”</p>
<p>“But&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Is there an emergency?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then hang up, put the phone away, close your eyes, and don’t worry. Everyone’s coming, we’ll tackle some things, compare notes, and all will be good.”</p>
<p>“Bye.”</p>
<p>“Bye Kenzie. See you soon.”</p>
<p>“In… twelve minutes. About. And Rain is coming, but he’s going to be later. He’ll arrive in&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Hang up the phone,” I said. “Or I’m going to start unplugging things at random.”</p>
<p>“Bye then.”</p>
<p>I didn’t respond, because it was apparent that Kenzie had to get the last word. The ambient noise came through the phone for another few seconds before she hung up. The cube to the right of her desk went dark.</p>
<p>It was strange to be in the space when the others had yet to arrive. Normally, my focus was on the task at hand, here. I wanted to be the rock, unmovable, in case others needed to reach out. It was hard to be that with Natalie’s words in my mind and the room empty.</p>
<p>The whiteboards were people’s thoughts encapsulated. Mine was numbers to call, things to do, a rough timeline of events, with the next being Auzure’s call to Cedar Point. They were Houndstooth’s recommendation. I added notes about the hack.</p>
<p>Kenzie had her costume notes, tinker notes, some drawings in erasable marker of her face, a circle with large eyes, a kiss-shaped mouth, and two buns, and various hearts and stars. She had two boards, one mounted on the wall behind the one with two legs and four wheels, and the tinker notes spilled out from the side of the one in front to the one in the back. So did the stars and hearts, for that matter.</p>
<p>Chris’ was at the other end, opposite her desk. I walked over to it, glancing at the others on the way. There were some names written down, but most had been erased.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Menagerie</em><br>
<em>Zoo</em><br>
<em>Zoological or Zoologic?</em><br>
<em>Hodgepodge or Hodge? Podge?</em></p>
<p><em>Note to self: bring books for Rain</em></p>
<p>All written in the bottom left corner. ‘Chris’ was in the top right corner, the ‘h’ smudged where a sleeve had rubbed up against it mid-write.</p>
<p>Ashley’s board was empty, except for a very elaborate, stylized rendition of her name. Kenzie had found some fonts and displayed them on the whiteboard for tracing. Ashley had okayed this one.</p>
<p>Just ‘Ashley’. Nothing else figured out.</p>
<p>Rain had two boards, like Kenzie. One on wheels, another on the wall behind. Unlike Kenzie, they weren’t even remotely organized by topic. Snag, Love Lost, Cradle, ‘5’, known acquaintances, tinker hands, contact pads, timeline for Snag’s operations, known places the cluster had been with lines drawn to names of acquaintances, name ideas with ‘handbreak’ crossed out because Tristan had apparently vetoed it, a crude calendar with the names of cluster members filling in blanks, Love Lost due tonight… and so on.</p>
<p>Just red marker and some brown, presumably to put in different words in gaps yet keep them distinct. Or because Kenzie had stolen the red marker to draw hearts.</p>
<p>Tristan’s was next to Rain’s, and Tristan’s was mostly devoted to team name ideas, room layouts, broader organization and schedule, and some minor notes on money spent. Byron hadn’t really showed up in the hideout, but Tristan had still devoted a quarter of the board to him. A list of movies. Aimed at letting Byron maintain a degree of communication with Chris and Rain, it seemed, from the comments on the side.</p>
<p>Sveta was taken up by a mix of art and names. She’d written out names not in a list, but as solitary words. Images had been drawn around them. Beneath ‘Moor’, a girl’s hair, wavy, with a fish head poking out to the right from between the two curtains of hair. It was very detailed for art on a whiteboard, with each scale getting a texture. Above ‘Lash’ was a feminine figure in stark black lines with back arched, head back, and breasts pointed skyward, the breasts so pointed they could have been used for Kenzie’s geometry homework. To the right of ‘Cirrus’ was a face drawn out in lines, frowning. ‘Berth’ was sitting in the bottom right corner in tiny text. The image was so small it was barely legible. It might have been Sveta’s rendition of herself, potato-shaped with arms and legs flailing. A line was drawn between its head and the word ‘no’, a speech bubble without the bubble.</p>
<p>I felt oddly fond at seeing it. That kind of mental working was inexplicable to me, but I liked seeing the hints of it.</p>
<p>After Sveta was my whiteboard, neatly organized, then Kenzie’s two, which I’d already noted.</p>
<p>I wanted to help them.</p>
<p>No. The boards didn’t convey it, the boards were things as they should be, even, but they <em>needed</em> help.</p>
<p>On so many levels, they needed help.</p>
<p>The by-proxy interaction with my mother had affected my mood. Natalie’s words and <em>concerns</em> had too, but it was hard to know how many of those were my mother’s and how many were her.</p>
<p>The <em>concern,</em> with emphasis on the word like I could remember Ashley doing… Even after I’d been hurt by the Nine, had worse done to me by my sister, and gone to the hospital, I couldn’t remember my mother ever expressing <em>concern</em> for my activities as a cape. If such was expressed in Natalie’s expression and words, then I could believe it was Natalie’s.</p>
<p>Concern for what I was doing, the path I was walking? I could see it being my mother’s, through Natalie-as-proxy.</p>
<p>It made me sad and angry and frustrated all at the same time, and I didn’t have any outlets for that. The punching bag hadn’t yet arrived and been set up, and I wasn’t about to throw myself at the villains. Not that I wanted to operate that way.</p>
<p>The villains were so simple, so easy. Cedar point. Bad guy central. I was supposed to dislike what they did and I did dislike it. I didn’t see anything redeeming in them, I had the power to stop them, and I wholly planned to. If I could mess with Tattletale in the process? Bad guy, I was supposed to dislike her, she’d done little that redeemed her, and it was <em>personal,</em> besides? Yeah. Fuck yes. But I’d do it smart, not by impulse.</p>
<p>Others… not so easy. My dad. Gilpatrick. Mrs. Yamada, even. They were the good guys and they hadn’t handled things perfectly. I felt varying degrees of heartbreak because of them but I couldn’t blame them. Not easy.</p>
<p>My life was filled with people I wanted to get angry at and couldn’t, because they were fundamentally broken and flawed. My mother. My sister. Amelia. <em>Amy.</em>  I’d said her name and thought about her for ten lifetimes’ worth, in just the span of two years. I felt vaguely ill that I was doing so now, even if it was for the sake of doing as Natalie had asked me to.</p>
<p>The only thing I hated more than being victim to other people’s emotional impulses and fucked-upness was when those other people were so close to me that it all came down on my head. The furthest thing from easy.</p>
<p>The door opened, interrupting my thoughts. I turned my head to see.</p>
<p>Sveta and Ashley. Tristan absent, even though he would normally catch the same train.</p>
<p>“Hi,” I said.</p>
<p>“What are you doing standing in the dark? At least turn the lights on,” Sveta chided me.</p>
<p>“There’s more than enough light from the windows,” I said. “It’s bright out.”</p>
<p>“I’d expect that behavior from Ashley, not you,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Sounds right,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>Sveta flicked the switch, looking up as the lights took their time coming on. It made me think of my mom. Turning on the lights, even when not strictly necessary. I could remember visiting friend’s houses and feeling like something was odd when other parents didn’t do it.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Thinking.”</p>
<p>“Uh oh.”</p>
<p>“Constructive thinking. I think. I hope. Had a chat with Natalie.”</p>
<p>“Uh oh,” Sveta said, again, as she sidled up to me.</p>
<p>I gave her a light push. She smiled, righted herself, and half-stepped, half-stumbled right next to me. She gave me a hug from behind, setting her chin on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Familiar sensation, there, in an eerie not-familiar way.</p>
<p>“Tristan’s walking the sprogs,” Sveta said. “Rain’s late.”</p>
<p>“Kenzie mentioned,” I said. “The second part. Sprogs?”</p>
<p>“Chris and Kenzie. I thought it was clever.”</p>
<p>“It was.”</p>
<p>She nodded, head moving against my shoulder. “You’re looking at the boards?”</p>
<p>I gestured in the direction of the whiteboards. “Natalie wants to know our mission statement, so she can fine-tune her advice. She wanted a lot of things, some harder to put into words than others. I’m looking at the whiteboards, trying to figure out what the thread is and how I can help.”</p>
<p>“Your board is empty, Ashley,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to call yourself Damsel of Distress?” I asked. “For that matter, what are you doing, costume-wise?”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to tell me not to wear a dress while I’m out with you all, you can fuck off,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Not wearing a dress could help with the Manton issues. You’re more likely to use your power to blow up the edge of a flapping dress than the part that hugs your body.”</p>
<p>“You can fuck off,” she said, again.</p>
<p>“Ashley likes dresses,” Sveta said. “We’ve had conversations about it. She thinks I should wear some, and I’ve had to repeatedly reinforce that I don’t have the legs for it, because I don’t have legs.”</p>
<p>“They multiply a lady’s grace,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“You can’t exaggerate a negative,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“You’re attached to the image,” I observed.</p>
<p>“Obviously,” Ashley said, turning to face me.</p>
<p>She was attached to <em>just</em> that image. I wasn’t sure if she had multiple versions of the same dress, but she didn’t change things up much. She had, however, bought the new dress in Cedar Point, and we’d seen on camera as she considered nail polish.</p>
<p>She wanted to change, maybe. But… how long had she stuck to this style? I’d fancied taking Sveta shopping, but now I was intrigued by this puzzle.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame you damage your dresses,” I said. I indicated the hem of her dress. “Are you learning to tailor or do you hire someone?”</p>
<p>“I’m studying it. Saves me money.”</p>
<p>“Okay, so… I have a bit of a crazy idea,” I said.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Bear with me,” I said.</p>
<p>“Bear with her,” Sveta said. “Victoria knows fashion.”</p>
<p>“You’re leading up to this like you know I’ll hate it.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Out with it, then,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Hair,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” was the response, without a beat missed.</p>
<p>“I can’t promise it would work, but hair can confuse the Manton effect. It might be that the power gets confused because it’s a part of your identity and a part of you, but it’s not alive either. There are parahumans who impregnate their costumes with hair to make them resistant to their own powers. There are some who have costumes that are <em>just</em> hair, or mostly hair, but those are pretty scanty, as you can probably imagine.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve heard of that parahuman,” Sveta said. When I arched an eyebrow, she said, “The hair impregnation thing.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to cut it off,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“That’s fine. I’m not even sure it would work, and it would be a shame to do it if it didn’t.”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“You could try saving the hairs that come free while you’re sleeping or brushing your hair,” I said.</p>
<p>“How much would I need?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“If it <em>did</em> work, you might not even need much. A strand every quarter-inch or so, along the length, or along the parts that are likely to get clipped by your power. Maybe a bit more.”</p>
<p>“And it’d be white hairs on a black background,” she said.</p>
<p>“You could, you know, not wear black?” I ventured.</p>
<p>“I like black,” she said. “It’s elegant. It works. The black dress every woman has in her closet for occasions is black for a reason.”</p>
<p>I was actually enjoying myself, because of the puzzle, and because it was my longest interaction with Ashley that hadn’t come to blows.</p>
<p>“Dye it?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t work,” Ashley said. “I have natural silver-blonde hair, but I use my power&mdash;”</p>
<p>She put her hand to the side of her head and used her power. I stepped back, stumbled into Sveta, then reached out to help her catch her balance.</p>
<p>Ashley’s hair settled back into place. Her pupils took a long few seconds to reappear.</p>
<p>The door swung open. It was Tristan, looking alarmed.</p>
<p>“We good,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“My eyes and hair lose their color,” Ashley said, in a non-sequitur for Tristan.</p>
<p>“You’d lose the dye,” I said. “Probably.”</p>
<p>Kenzie and Chris appeared behind Tristan. He let them in.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Talking fashion,” Sveta offered.</p>
<p>“Which involves reality-shattering explosions, naturally,” Chris said. He grinned.</p>
<p>He was wearing a newer t-shirt, with a gorn-metal band’s album cover on the front. Not my style. He was broader around the middle, but I diplomatically avoided mentioning it.</p>
<p>“You’re taller,” I observed.</p>
<p>“One and a half inches taller,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“He went with the indulgence thing yesterday,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Chris said. “I knew there was a risk I might be useless for the day, putting myself in a state where I just sit around, eat, play games. So I fucked off. I’ll hit anxiety a few times in the next while, but I’ll make it mad twitchiness so there’s some more motive behind it, instead of it being paralyzing. That’ll be fun.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like you’re going overboard. Shouldn’t you be balancing things out?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be minding your own business?” Chris asked. “Go talk fashion. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>He walked over to his corner, near where his whiteboard was. Kenzie moved to follow, and Chris turned around, reached out to grab her by the shoulders, and turned her to face us, before going back on his way, to his whiteboard.</p>
<p>“Fashion,” Tristan said. “Okay. We’ve got some stylish and artsy people here. I’m not so up there on girl-fashion, but I’ll contribute what I can.”</p>
<p>“Ashley is married to this look,” I said.</p>
<p>“Married is the wrong word,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“How would you put it?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“A long time ago, when I was still finding my way, I didn’t even have the clothes on my back, not intact ones. I had no friends, no family, and law enforcement was after me. I had <em>nothing</em>. I spent a lot of time thinking about who and what I wanted to be. Characters I liked, clothes I liked, people I’d thought were elegant and imposing. I found this. I <em>built</em> this,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>What had her role models been, for aesthetics? Cartoon movie villains? Evil sorceresses and witches?</p>
<p>“When you had nothing, you found this, and you want to hold onto that,” Sveta said. “I can understand that. I hold onto things that were important to me once.”</p>
<p>“Like Weld,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Among others,” Sveta said, giving me more of a hug.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hold onto anything,” Ashley said. “I <em>am</em> that. People spend their entire lives trying to find the right image for themselves and I found it when I was Kenzie’s age.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re going to win this one, Victoria,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Theoretically speaking,” I started.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’m getting out of the line of fire,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be mean,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Call with Auzure in a short bit. Rain might miss it,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“<em>Theoretically speaking…</em> can I put something out there?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Can I stop you?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“Tell me to and I’ll stop right here. You can do your thing.”</p>
<p>Sveta rocked her head left and right on my shoulder, chin digging in, until I shrugged her off. Ashley considered.</p>
<p>“Theoretically,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Theoretically,” I picked up the prompt, “You’re going to be a hero. You have a crystal clear image of what you’ll look like as a villain. Your every expectation is that you’ll stop being a hero at one point and return to villainy.”</p>
<p>“That’s not theory. That’s fact.”</p>
<p>“But what <em>is</em> theory is… what if, to avoid your hero self and villain self getting mixed up, you tried something different, in the here and now? It keeps your villain persona distinct.”</p>
<p>Ashley folded her arms.</p>
<p>“Different how? I get the impression you have something in mind,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Pshht!” Ashley made the sound, shushing Sveta.</p>
<p>“Don’t pshht me.”</p>
<p>“What if, theoretically,” I said, “You cut off the hair? White hair for a white costume. You can still do something with black accents here and there, but we can go more… white goth. Or something in that vein.”</p>
<p>“I’m not goth,” Ashley said. “And I’m not cutting my hair.”</p>
<p>“Theoret&mdash;” I started.</p>
<p>I saw her expression change.</p>
<p>More seriously, I said, “You cutting your hair could be a commitment. You could go back to being the long-haired villainess, but only after a period of time. You’d be locking yourself into being a hero in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“A hair-based time commitment,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to do it,” Ashley said. “To preserve my costume? For that minor gain, I’m supposed to risk looking like a simpleton? No.”</p>
<p>“What kind of black accents?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Black around the eyes, like heavy eyeliner, maybe decoration in the hair, or as part of the mask, something to frame the edges of sleeves and dress.”</p>
<p>Kenzie went still. She gave Ashley a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>“What?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“Back before Mrs. Yamada told me I wasn’t supposed to give anyone a birthday present, I was thinking about what to get you.”</p>
<p>“If Mrs. Yamada said no, then there’s probably a reason,” I said.</p>
<p>“The group was new and Ashley and I were only just starting to talk, so it would’ve been weird, I think. It wouldn’t be for just Ashley either, it’d be for the group.”</p>
<p>“Spit it out,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Eyes,” Kenzie said. “I can put these things in your mask and it would project over your eyes. We could have you wear a white costume, and then there would be bits that are black, and then we could make your eyes totally, one hundred percent black, or totally white.”</p>
<p>“Hold up,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned my way.</p>
<p>“When you say something like ‘I can make this’, I have to ask… how easily?”</p>
<p>“Super easily. A few hours easy,” Kenzie said. When I didn’t shut her down, she turned to Ashley, “We could have it so smoke comes off of your eyes and trails behind you as you walk. or blurry light, like when you wave a sparkler in the dark, or particles, like shapes, or blurs like your power makes, or&mdash;”</p>
<p>Ashley put a hand on top of Kenzie’s head. Kenzie stopped talking.</p>
<p>“Do you want to? Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“If I went to buy you a gift, to balance it out, so it was equal, what would you want?”</p>
<p>“Went? I don’t want you to go anywhere.”</p>
<p>“I meant some other time.”</p>
<p>“No gift,” Kenzie said. “Hang out. Talk with me. Come on, we can use your whiteboard. We’ll talk and take notes, and figure out what your costume might be. Let me search for things on my phone&mdash;”</p>
<p>Kenzie took Ashley’s hand and led her to the whiteboard, tugging her along. Ashley didn’t object too much along the way.</p>
<p>Near Kenzie’s computers, Tristan had his arms folded, his eyebrow raised. Sveta had her head cocked to one side as she studied me. Chris was dumping his bag out on his little table.</p>
<p>“She’s not hard to figure out or anything,” I said, quiet enough that only Sveta would hear me. “At one point she said we were pretty similar people.”</p>
<p>“That leaves me with <em>way</em> more questions than answers,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Tristan called out, “Don’t get too into it, you two! We’re listening in on the call with Auzure soon!”</p>
<p>Ashley raised a hand, waving him off. Kenzie was just nonstop background chatter now.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Sveta asked. “You’re introspective today.”</p>
<p>“Extraspective, right this moment,” I said. “Thinking about the big picture.”</p>
<p>“Think out loud.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “The team. How it fits together. How I fit into it.”</p>
<p>“A bit of introspection then.”</p>
<p>“No, not exactly,” I said, the thought clarifying as I said it. “How’s Weld doing?”</p>
<p>“If he could get tired he’d be dog tired. I need to have a talk with him soon, before things get to a point where I don’t see him ever,” Sveta said. “I hate to add anything to his plate, but I have to be assertive.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you have him,” I said.</p>
<p>Sveta smiled. “I’m glad I have him too. Even if he’s tired and gone most of the time. Why are you asking about him?”</p>
<p>“When Jessica&mdash; When Mrs. Yamada asked me to sit in with the group and help out. She asked Weld first, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you caught that,” Sveta said. The smile disappeared. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t sure if you did, and I didn’t want to risk hurting your feelings.”</p>
<p>“Was I second choice?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. Sorry, I don’t know for sure, but Weld was asked and he said no, but he said he’d be free a little while after. She could have waited and had Weld sit in, but she chose you.”</p>
<p>“And she seemed okay, almost relieved, at me doing <em>this</em>,” I said.</p>
<p>“As okay as she is with any of this,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>The display on the wall lit up. The trill of the phone filled the room.</p>
<p>“They’re calling us first,” Tristan said. “Everyone come. Seems like Rain is going to miss this. Sucks.”</p>
<p>We gathered at the desk.</p>
<p>“We need something to call you,” the woman’s voice on the other line said. “Dido speaking, with Auzure.”</p>
<p>“Dido, this is Capricorn. You’re on speaker with most of the rest of the team listening in. We’re working on the team name. We’ll have something soon.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to go over the particulars, make sure we do this right. We’re going to be calling…”</p>
<p>I mostly tuned it out. Tristan had it handled, and it wasn’t rocket science. I wasn’t that fond of Auzure, either.</p>
<p>Natalie had asked me what I was doing.</p>
<p>I’d been asked to be here. I was damaged, and Mrs. Yamada knew it. Why was I here, then? Yesterday, I might have said it was so I could provide this kind of direction and guidance. So I could talk to the lawyer, handle situations like Kenzie’s and Ashley’s, and be a friend to Sveta.</p>
<p>Was I right? Thinking that Yamada had felt like she’d done her job in putting me here? Was I overthinking things after my talk with Natalie, paranoia rearing its ugly head again?</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” Dido said. “Should we conference you in?”</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said. “We’ve got a number you can call, it’ll route through to them, and it won’t be as blatant as a conference call.”</p>
<p>“Lovely. I wondered if I should mention something. Good to work with people who know what they’re doing. What number?”</p>
<p>Sveta mouthed the word ‘slimy’ at me.</p>
<p>Water off my back, now. I’d just dealt with my mom and this was easy by comparison.</p>
<p>Tristan gave the number, and the call was terminated.</p>
<p>He checked his phone.</p>
<p>“Rain wants to know if people are okay with him inviting Erin. They’re still half an hour away. She gave him a ride and they stopped along the way. He says he’s safe, no trouble, but he wants to talk, and he wants her here when he does.”</p>
<p>Tristan’s voice was just a bit tight.</p>
<p>“I have suspicions,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I know, I think,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>With that, I felt like the musings crystallized. I wouldn’t know until I talked to Jessica, but I had more of an idea. Things made a degree of sense.</p>
<p>“Not here,” I said.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Gut feeling, but we’ll meet him to talk somewhere nearby, as soon as this call is wrapped up and we’ve seen how they respond. Half an hour should be plenty of time. But let’s not do it here,” I said.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap42">Shade &mdash; 4.7</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>“Hello? This is Andre Giannone.”</p>
<p>“Andre, hello. We were hoping you could help us out. We want to rent some locations in Cedar Point.”</p>
<p>“Where did you get this number?”</p>
<p>“We went to the source. Mortari Construction handled the building in Cedar Point, and they gave us the name of… Andrea Giannone? Could it be your daughter we’re wanting to contact?”</p>
<p>“I am Andrea, I go by Andre. Easier, not having to explain that I’m not a woman. It’s a man’s name where I was born.”</p>
<p>“That’s great. Andre, aren’t you the one charged with leasing the properties?”</p>
<p>“Their records are out of date. I’ve washed my hands of the business. Look elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“Can you give us the number of the person we can call?”</p>
<p>“No. There are no vacancies in Cedar Point right now, and I won’t give you the number because I don’t know who is handling things.”</p>
<p><em>‘Won’t</em> give you the number’, I noted. Not ‘<em>can’t give you the number</em>‘. Despite not knowing?</p>
<p>“A cursory internet search suggests there are a <em>lot</em> of vacancies in Cedar Point. People are noting it and asking why.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>“You live there.”</p>
<p>“I keep to myself. <em>Look elsewhere</em>. Stop bothering an old man.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Giannone, I understand if you’re scared. Don’t answer me if you’re worried people are listening in. We’re heroes.”</p>
<p>Was the summary silence on the other end because he was worried people were listening in, or was it shock?</p>
<p>“We’re heroes. We’re a corporate team with plans of settling in. We know there are vacancies, and we know you still have signs up. If we can get this working, we’re going to look after you and the people in Cedar Point.”</p>
<p>“What? A corporate team?”</p>
<p>“Of heroes, Mr. Giannone. We call ourselves Auzure. Au for the chemical symbol for gold, azure for blue, I don’t know if that will help you remember. You’ll see us around, if we can do this without stepping on anyone else’s toes.”</p>
<p>“Toes? What?”</p>
<p>I glanced over the others, and saw Tristan doing the same thing. His eyes met mine. I wondered if he had the same thought I did, about how Dido’s clarification about the name would only confuse people.</p>
<p>“Jurisdictions, Mr. Giannone. It wouldn’t be good if we turned up there and ended up in a turf war with fellow heroes over who gets to help.”</p>
<p>“Why would there be fighting to&mdash; there’s nothing here. There’s nobody here. It’s a nowhere place. Everyone who could leave left. Everyone else wants to be left alone.”</p>
<p>Was he aware of the contradiction in what he’d said? That there were no vacancies, but there was nobody there?</p>
<p>Dido went on, taking on a tone that made me think she was in sales. “It might be a nowhere place right now, Mr. Giannone, but I promise you, Auzure can change that. The other heroes want to change it. Whatever happens, you’re going to get some stellar heroes in your neighborhood. Hopefully it’s us, and we can clear the way so that everyone that left can come back.”</p>
<p>Dido’s earnest, almost painful optimism toward the end was contrasted by the sputtering reply.</p>
<p>“You’ll make this place a warzone.”</p>
<p>“We’ll handle things in a good way. Trust us. Auzure is gentle but we get the job done.”</p>
<p>There was inarticulate sputtering on the other side for a few seconds. “I’m not the person to bother with this. Don’t call me again.”</p>
<p>Mr. Andre Giannone hung up the phone.</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Tristan said, putting a hand on the back of Kenzie’s chair.</p>
<p>The camera shifted, focusing on a small house on the edge of the downtown strip. Tall windows and a realty sign, with the second floor having suggestions of an upstairs apartment.</p>
<p>“I feel bad,” Dido said, speaking to the dead air.</p>
<p>“Can we talk back to her?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“No, but&mdash;” Kenzie hit a few keys. The call ended, and then the phone rang.</p>
<p>“Here you are,” Dido said. “Beautiful. Was that what you needed?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to see,” Tristan said. “The man you called is going out for a walk.”</p>
<p>Mr. Giannone was dressed in a suit jacket over what might have been a thin sweater or long-sleeved shirt, with nice hair combed straight back from his face, but where he might have looked dashing, gray hair or no, he had bad posture that made him look older than he probably was. He walked with what I could only call alacrity.</p>
<p>“Patching in,” Kenzie said. “We’ll send you the video after, but for now it’s going to be audio only.”</p>
<p>“Lovely! I get to see and hear the rest?”</p>
<p>“It’s part of the deal,” Tristan said. “We’ll pass on info about villains and the greater villain network as we pull things together. We’re hoping you’ll keep from stepping on our toes in the meantime, as you put it. Houndstooth was saying you were better than some of your teammates about jumping into something like this without regard for us.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I could see it if we were itching for something to do, but I don’t think it’s likely. Right now, I don’t think we could. Too much to do already.”</p>
<p>“The war?” I asked.</p>
<p>“That’s a big part of it.”</p>
<p>“How is it? How bad?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“I have no idea. It feels like none of the people doing the talking and negotiations want it to happen, especially as we’re getting hints about how bitter a war it could be. Earth C doesn’t mess around.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s going to happen?” Sveta asked. She sounded more anxious now.</p>
<p>“The diplomats and most of the people at the very top on both sides are fighting it, but it seems like things are moving inexorably in that direction. Yes.”</p>
<p>Sveta’s chin dropped a bit as she looked down at the ground. I reached out for her, and stopped as I heard a small ‘thup’ sound, followed by another.</p>
<p>Her arms and legs hadn’t moved, so I took it as her tendrils striking at the interior of her body in the same way a prisoner might punch the wall of their cell.</p>
<p>“My hope is we’ll keep moving at this steady, unwilling pace, there will be an initial exchange of blows, and both sides back off,” Dido said. “My worry is that something explosive will happen. Another broken trigger, an attack from Earth C doomsday radicals, an attack from the Fourth Sect, someone stupid from our world trying to take territory over there. I could go on. It might spark something lasting.”</p>
<p>I approached Sveta in a way that let her see I was coming, moving slowly. I wanted to ask if it was okay to make contact, and I didn’t want to say it out loud, where the others or Dido might hear.</p>
<p>“Fourth Sect?” Tristan asked. “Have I heard of this before?”</p>
<p>Sveta saw me and reached out. I took her hand in mine, and reached out with the other arm to put it around her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’d call it a cult but I’m not sure it’s the right term. They’re a minority power with a strong political voice. They want war, to thin their own populations after too much ‘be fruitful and multiply’. Hard to get into in any detail on that cycle. Some of Gimel’s biggest allies in Earth C are people who want to postpone war because it makes the Fourth Sect weaker.”</p>
<p>“Your thinking is if they get to the point where they’re desperate, they’ll try to spark something,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Not my thinking. People higher than me. They’re some of what we’re watching out for.”</p>
<p>Tristan glanced at Sveta, then said, “We’re okay, right? We do have the edge on powers. Makes for an incredible toolbox.”</p>
<p>“We have an edge, but it’s not as big as you might think,” Dido said. “Our side has people who can detect or see powers, and what we keep hearing from them is that this guy has powers, but on the down-low. That woman has powers, nobody seems to be aware. A lot of them are using their abilities to maneuver into positions of power.”</p>
<p>“Can we stop talking about this?” Sveta asked. It felt strange hearing so abrupt a question when I hadn’t felt it in her body or breathing.</p>
<p>“We can,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Sveta said. “To cut in like that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind, love,” Dido said. “We can talk about other things. I’d welcome the distractions.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Giannone is at the center of town. He seems to know where to go to talk to the villains,” Tristan reported.</p>
<p>“Lovely,” Dido said. “Some silliness to take my mind off of things.”</p>
<p>Silliness. We were treating this situation as serious, we were trying to save Cedar Point and the people within, and we were trying to break up a criminal organization before it extended its reach too far or imploded. With all of our various issues, with one team member’s life on the line, we were making sacrifices and devoting ourselves to this in the long term.</p>
<p><em>Silliness</em>?</p>
<p>To someone that was trying to head off a war with another universe? I could concede her that, but I could also think she could have worded it way more respectfully.</p>
<p>I decided to write her off as a bit of a ditz and let it be.</p>
<p>Giannone entered the bar, and my first thought was that we wouldn’t have the audio or video.</p>
<p>Moments later, however, he emerged with Prancer.</p>
<p>“…not involved in this.”</p>
<p>“Andre, if you don’t want to be involved, walking into the bar where we gather isn’t the way to do it. Not voicing your issues in earshot of ten people with powers. Let’s talk in my office.”</p>
<p>“Being seen walking into your office isn’t any better,” Andre Giannone said, resisting being led by the arm. Prancer stopped trying, and the older man said, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll keep it polite,” Prancer said, “Both in what we talk about, and in appearing civil.”</p>
<p>The people in the bar could see out the window.</p>
<p>“They called me. What am I supposed to say? If this goes to court&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about court.”</p>
<p>“What if?” Andre said.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to. The courts have too much to do to bother with someone like you. Even with people like us.”</p>
<p>“You said the heroes wouldn’t bother either, and how many have we seen or heard about now?”</p>
<p>“Andre. Listen. If they decide they’ll bother with petty crime, they’ll come after me, the other villains. They won’t go after the scared citizens. If they thought someone had done something, they would think it was because the people were forced.”</p>
<p>Prancer’s tone changed at the end there. Too light to be anything but joking. I wondered how tone would play out with the court, if Giannone was charged. I let go of Sveta and walked over to the whiteboard to note the question. Something for a future discussion with Natalie or someone like her.</p>
<p>“I don’t want this hassle,” Andre Giannone said.</p>
<p>“I understand. We’re already taking steps. We’re getting information, we’re getting help. We’ll have more in a bit, and we’ll fill you in.”</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do when they call?”</p>
<p>“Hang up. Say whatever you said. Tell them you have no space. Do whatever you have to, but don’t rent to them. And don’t show up at the bar. Call me.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to get you sooner than that.”</p>
<p>“Call. Now, who was it that called?”</p>
<p>“Something about blue and gold.”</p>
<p>“Goldenrod?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t know. Maybe.”</p>
<p>I felt a kind of satisfaction at the confusion. Dido was a salesman, maybe, or a face-person, but she wasn’t a marketing person. The way she’d described Auzure hadn’t been a good way to make it memorable.</p>
<p>“Could it have been Auzure?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>“That’s it, I think.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Prancer said. “I know someone I can ask for more details on what they’re doing. That’s good. Useful.”</p>
<p>“Who do you know?” Dido asked, as if Prancer could hear her.</p>
<p>Prancer continued talking, oblivious. “Next time, remember. That’s all you need to do. Leave it to me to decide if we need to worry.”</p>
<p>He laid a hand on Andre Giannone’s shoulder as he said it. It was a way to show support, and also a way to steer his conversation partner, suggesting the man walk back the way he came.</p>
<p>“I’ve held up my end so far,” Andre said, resisting being guided as he said it.</p>
<p>“And you get allowances others in the neighborhood don’t. Nobody knocks on your door. You have tenants.”</p>
<p>“Nobody’s knocking on my door, maybe, but I’m getting calls.”</p>
<p>“A call. One,” Prancer said. He walked, one hand on Andre Giannone’s shoulder, getting Andre started on his way. “And we’re taking steps to rectify the unwelcome attention. Things should calm down soon.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Andre said. He looked at Prancer. “I don’t need to worry?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry.”</p>
<p>Andre walked away. Prancer stood where he was, hooking thumbs in his jacket pockets, head tilted. The camera got a good angled view of his expression as he turned around. A confident smile.</p>
<p>A smile for the people in the window who might be looking at him, but he spoke under his breath, too quiet for even Kenzie’s camera to pick up.</p>
<p>“Can you get that for us?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Yep!”</p>
<p>It took a short bit, and Prancer didn’t re-enter the bar, instead walking over to the building across the street, where his ‘office’ apparently was.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?” Prancer’s hiss came through the speakers.</p>
<p>“We’re going on,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the help, Dido,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to, hon. I was worried I’d bothered an old man for nothing, but he’s in this, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“We had cues he was.”</p>
<p>“Let us know if you need anything else.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>The conversation wrapped up with some goodbyes, and the call ended. Windows closed, and parts of Kenzie’s computer-cube went dark.</p>
<p>“We’ve got one group passing through later this afternoon. We could postpone it if needed. These guys are Houndstooth’s recommends,” Tristan said. “Victoria? You’ll handle it?”</p>
<p>“My cousin will come with. Just in case they’re keeping an eye out for me and have surface-to-air planned.”</p>
<p>“Missiles?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Anything,” I said.</p>
<p>“They’re starting to adapt,” Tristan said. “Info and help?”</p>
<p>“As far as info goes,” I said, “Natalie said someone tried hacking into the Wardens’ headquarters, specifically targeting my mom.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t me,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I feel like if it was Tattletale, they would have been cleverer about it. Sveta, since you were seen too, though they probably can’t connect you to your past self, you might want to make sure all accounts are secure.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Then that only leaves Rain,” Tristan said. “Decompress, take notes, do whatever. We leave to meet him in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>He was taking on the leadership role. Ashley had seemed to want it, and she’d included herself when Houndstooth had wanted to meet people in charge, but she wasn’t fighting him on this.</p>
<p>I noted that, and I wondered.</p>
<p>I watched as the tight cluster of the group broke up. No longer gathered around the screen, standing behind Kenzie’s desk, they moved toward their individual spaces. Chris had the largest bubble around him, where he didn’t have people within it. His gait was different than it had been.</p>
<p>Ashley went to her board. She’d been quiet throughout, and now she stopped in front of her whiteboard. A mix of her writing and Kenzie’s marked it, with her writing along the center, each line slanted as if it was written on an angle, like a tower of stacked coins that was about to buckle and fall. Kenzie’s writing marked the bottom third, with a few drawings of eyes.</p>
<p>Whatever means of communication they had devised between them, I couldn’t decipher it. I couldn’t even begin to read Ashley’s handwriting. Kenzie went to Ashley to resume their prior discussion.</p>
<p>“You okay?” Tristan asked. I turned to look. He was talking to Sveta. “You didn’t like that talk about war.”</p>
<p>Sveta shrugged. She smiled as I joined their conversation. “Thank you for the hug. I didn’t even realize how upset I was until you came up to me.”</p>
<p>“Anytime,” I said.</p>
<p>“Was it the thought of Weld over there that got you?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Sveta shrugged, but it wasn’t too effective with her suit. “What threw me was when Dido talked about how people with powers were getting positions.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because it might not be only that. The people with positions might be getting powers.”</p>
<p>“Cauldron?” I asked.</p>
<p>Sveta nodded. “Earth C is a major reason we had the supplies to rebuild. They say they did it out of goodwill. I think Cauldron made it happen. Gave powers to key people so they would agree, made deals.”</p>
<p>She put out one arm, indicating the window and the city beyond it.</p>
<p>“How much of that was bought and paid for with crimes against humanity? I saw some of what they did. I heard a lot more about it. My entire life, this body of mine, it’s because of them,” Sveta said. “It’s awful to think about.”</p>
<p>I looked out at the city that gleamed with traces of yellow and gold in the light of the early afternoon.</p>
<p>“I don’t know a lot about them,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I only know some,” I said. “The info came out after, but it trickles out, there’s a lot of guessing to be done.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have to guess,” Sveta said. “I can tell you more some day. But it’s going to take a few minutes longer than it takes to talk to Rain.”</p>
<p>Chris had joined Kenzie and Ashley’s conversation. Kenzie was bouncing with excitement, trying to get Chris’ input. He seemed reluctant to dish, but quick to shoot down this idea or that idea.</p>
<p>“You want to sit on this, skip out on the Rain conversation?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Sveta said. “I think I have to go, because I’m one of the only people who knows most of the story. It feels like I’m the only one who knows most of everyone’s story. I know yours, Victoria. I know Rain’s, I think. I have my suspicions about what he’s going to say.”</p>
<p>“I think I know,” Tristan said. “And I have a few <em>big</em> worries.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I flew around the area before settling down. Everyone was gathered.</p>
<p>Erin drove a different vehicle than the last time. It was a sedan, small and very dusty. The accumulated fine dirt on the side had settled into waves that looked like very flat, spread out sand dunes, set on a vertical surface, with peaks, valleys, and patterns.</p>
<p>Erin opened the door. The dark makeup around her eyes was heavier, her hair was unwashed, and she wore a slim-fit sweatshirt with the sleeves rolled up, a cat on the sleeve. Her low-rise jeans were tucked into calf-height boots.</p>
<p>“Hi Erin,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Hi, critter,” Erin said. “How are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I was having a good day, but now this is happening. Feels ominous.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Erin said.</p>
<p>Rain took more time to get out of the passenger seat. He moved like an old man, shutting the door, letting a backpack fall to the ground by one of the car’s wheels. He had a black eye, his ear was swollen and scraped up, and his face looked asymmetrical in a way that suggested swelling on one side, with no distinct source. His knuckles and fingers were badly scraped up, with tape covering up some of them.</p>
<p>He was wearing a raglan tee with black sleeves, and jeans so old that they must have been as soft as sweatpants. The knees were worn through, and the knees beneath were speckled with scabs.</p>
<p>“You’re hurt,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“Did you get attacked?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>Rain shook his head. “Not by Snag’s group.”</p>
<p>It was hard, to pull back and watch. I’d tried for the call with Dido, stepped back to observe, letting Tristan take point with directing the others. He was good at it. Sveta being the one who had struggled had pulled me in a bit.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure strict objectivity was the way to handle this, but getting too close didn’t help either.</p>
<p>That line of thought got me thinking about how I hadn’t ever really had to watch my back. Not among those I considered allies. Not among friends. Not among family.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, made me think about my sister, and the sick, hollow, angry experience of being betrayed by someone I’d thought I could trust more than I trusted myself.</p>
<p>I stood across from Rain and I felt like I had in the bank. The bank had been dusty, partially my fault, the floor scratched up by the passage of giant dogs, littered with discarded pieces of paper and dropped belongings. It had been dark, the rain pattering outside.</p>
<p>Much like Rain stood by the front of the car, hurting, his life in danger, my sister had stood a distance away from me, a knife to her throat.</p>
<p>Following that there had been the revelation of secrets. It wasn’t that I held Rain close to my heart or anything. It wasn’t even that I particularly trusted him. Only that I recognized the pattern.</p>
<p>“Shit,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to draw this out, at least tell me this isn’t you explaining everything <em>and</em> dropping something heavy on me,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“No big news for you,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Tristan nodded.</p>
<p>“You’re going to tell us what’s been going on with you?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>Rain looked at Erin. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“She’s tied to this?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. “Kind of. She could walk away free and clear if she wanted, I think. She knows most of my situation. Not all.”</p>
<p>“I’m moral support,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. “Because there’s stuff you don’t know. Kind of. It’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got a look in your eyes,” Ashley said. “Fiercer.”</p>
<p>“I spent a good day and got a beating trying to find that fierceness,” Rain said. “That thing that would let me say this. Tristan called me out, said I needed to tell you guys, because it impacts what we’re doing. I needed to do some figuring out before I was able.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I was silent. I could only see the parallels. I held my tongue because I didn’t trust it. If this was an echo of that situation in the bank, I had no better idea on how to handle it now in the present.</p>
<p>No rain, no enclosed area. We were at the edge of a park. It was sunny out.</p>
<p>No knife to anyone’s throat, not that Rain’s expression said any different.</p>
<p>“You’ve been hiding with powerful people,” Ashley said. “Capes, probably.”</p>
<p>Rain opened his mouth, then nodded.</p>
<p>“A gang.”</p>
<p>“A family,” Rain said. “Gang doesn’t really say it.”</p>
<p>“It was always us and them. And there was a lot of hate directed at <em>them</em>,” Rain said.</p>
<p>The in-group, out-group… and family. I could connect dots. I deliberately avoided doing so.</p>
<p>I focused on the situation instead, on the others. Chris was quiet, smiling slightly, but the smile had been a small, persistent thing since he’d nose-dived into indulgence. Tristan was quiet, but most of what he had to add were things that it was Rain’s responsibility to share. Ashley handled the questions.</p>
<p>No&mdash; Sveta joined her voice to Ashley’s. “You’re related to those powers. It’s why you have such a hard time pulling away.”</p>
<p>“The Fallen,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I winced. There were a lot of implications to that.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I kind of connected the dots already,” Sveta said. She put a hand on Kenzie’s shoulder. “You first connected to Tristan after the God thing.”</p>
<p>“Religion came up in therapy,” Rain said, for the benefit of the rest of us. “Tristan came up to me after and asked about which church my family attended. I’d had a bad week. Nearly as bad as this week has been. We’d already connected some. Both of us have people invading our heads, questions of self, we talked a lot together in therapy. I cracked. I told him.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said. “Mom and dad were looking for a church. I thought I’d ask Rain. I don’t think Rain’s church would’ve suited them.”</p>
<p>“It’s not funny,” Kenzie said. “Don’t make jokes.”</p>
<p>“I’m not laughing, Kenzie,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“They hate black people, don’t they?” Kenzie asked Rain.</p>
<p>“They’re a big group,” Rain said. “It’s hard to get into just how varied the branches are, the different beliefs, how they add up, some of the leaders that have come and gone. It’s hard to just point at them and say they hate this or they hate that.”</p>
<p>“Most of them hate black people,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Did your family? Did you? Do you?”</p>
<p>Rain looked back at Erin. “Yeah. I did. Once. You have to understand&mdash; it’s hatred for anyone and everyone, because that way it keeps everyone close to the family. So ‘black’ was just one more label, you know?”</p>
<p>“Back at the first meeting with Mrs. Yamada. You kept giving me looks,” Kenzie said. “They weren’t because I pay attention to the clothes I wear and dress nice, or because you were trying to figure out what was wrong with me.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t about you,” Rain said. “I was figuring stuff out then. I was trying to reassess my whole way of thinking. It was me, not you.”</p>
<p>“It was you,” Kenzie said. She paused. “Being uncomfortable with me being there.”</p>
<p>“It was&mdash;” Rain started. “Me being uncomfortable with <em>everything.”</em></p>
<p>“Including me. Especially me, right then,” Kenzie said. She paused, waited for a response. When Rain didn’t deny her, she added, “That… sucks.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying you suck. It sucks to hear it.”</p>
<p>“If it helps,” Rain said. “I’ve changed a lot since then. I’m still figuring some stuff out.”</p>
<p>“A lot of different groups to un-hate,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I&mdash; kind of,” Rain said. “I still catch myself a lot. I think of things, I realize I’m making these assumptions. Then I want to change and I don’t know how. I try to use you guys as role models or talk to Mrs. Yamada, or I read, look up and watch a movie. But it’s a lot to re-teach myself.”</p>
<p>“Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Natives, Middle Easterners, then gay, trans,” Tristan rattled off.</p>
<p>“Deeper than that,” Rain said. “I had to start with re-figuring <em>women</em> and how I thought about them. I’m still pretty shitty, as much as I’m trying, because I hear you rattle that off and my first thought is ‘some of these aren’t like the others’ and I have to stop myself.”</p>
<p>“You’ve said a few things,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>“I figured you were a redneck.”</p>
<p>“Worse,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“They get in your head,” Erin jumped in. “They got my parents. My little brother. They got Rain when he was little. I accept he’s trying.”</p>
<p>“There was a Fallen group that found a pair of people like me,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Rain closed his eyes, looked down.</p>
<p>“Boy and a girl. Case fifty-threes. Arizona. Peat and Fen. They showed up in a few cities, did some stunts, hero-ish. Junior level stuff. But they were juniors, we think.”</p>
<p>“I know the story,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“They were terrified of vehicles and they hated the idea of the PRT. They had a lot of peculiarities. They couldn’t stay in one place for long. Communities pulled together. It was a really cool thing, they’d get motel rooms paid for by fans, they had tutors come to visit. There was talk of trying to get them into the school system. It was tricky because they were tricky.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“It was a really cool thing,” Sveta said. “There were blogs that followed them, and they were really positive. There was art drawn of them&mdash; I really liked that. A couple of times a week there would be articles talking about how they were doing something new and better and it was a step forward.”</p>
<p>“I knew some of it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You should know all of it. There was a time in my life when I could only vicariously enjoy those sorts of things, and I’d wake up and I’d tell myself I would check the blog after lunch and I would check the art page after dinner, and that was the sort of thing that helped me get through the days. Weld stuff was first thing. There were others. But Peat and Fen were big.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“They went down the wrong stretch of road and some Fallen jackasses on motorcycles thought they’d get a good reaction from people by holding the pair down and taking a chainsaw to their horns. To decorate their <em>fucking</em> helmets!”</p>
<p>Rain nodded, averting his eyes.</p>
<p>“Knife marks suggested someone tried to cut off one of their faces to wear it as a <em>mask</em>. You can imagine how I felt,” Sveta said. She moved her hair, showing the edge of her face, the mass of pencil-thin black tendrils behind it. “Since I’m <em>only</em> a mask and an assortment of lethal weapons. You can imagine how I felt, when instead of my daily pick-me up I got the news that they’d died from loss of their horns.”</p>
<p>Kenzie ducked her head, and started to walk away. When I went to follow and check her head, Ashley held up a hand and bid me to stop, following Kenzie instead.</p>
<p>“This isn’t an inquisition,” Erin said. “Rain isn’t responsible for everything the Fallen have done.”</p>
<p>Sveta ignored Erin for the moment. “Other Fallen groups have taken us for freak shows. The embodiments of the end times. Tom and Jake Crowley. I know that’s not on you, Rain, but you have to realize they aren’t good people.”</p>
<p>“I’m more than aware.”</p>
<p>“Then at least tell me you’re not going to go back,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I have to,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I could see Sveta’s face fall.</p>
<p>“I have to,” Rain said. “I have no choice. Really.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sveta said, her voice sad. “I think you have more choice than you think you do.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t. If I could do anything else, I would. I’m aware of a lot of things that are worse than Peat and Fen,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“What happened to Peat and Fen is pretty <em>fucking</em> bad,” Sveta said. She turned to Erin. “You’re not responsible for what others did, but if you’re leaning on them for protection or strength, then that’s not okay. You can’t use that strength.”</p>
<p>“They have my family,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“And they don’t let you go,” Rain said. “It’s all… very complicated.”</p>
<p>Ashley returned to the group. Kenzie was still sitting in the grass, a distance away, her back to us.</p>
<p>When I looked, Ashley gestured. Telling me to stay.</p>
<p>Rain looked pretty battered. Dejected.</p>
<p>He met my eyes.</p>
<p>“There’s more to it,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“If you won’t say it, then I will,” Ashley said. “I’ll guess. You killed people.”</p>
<p>Rain went very still.</p>
<p>I could remember a similar look on my sister’s face.</p>
<p>He huffed out a breath, hands at his lap as he slouched back against the front of the sedan, sitting against the hood. He didn’t seem to know what to do with his hands.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” he finally said.</p>
<p>“Innocents,” she said.</p>
<p>“Kids,” Rain said. He looked in Kenzie’s direction. At Chris. Then he looked over his shoulder at Erin.</p>
<p>“Why?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“I’ve been asking myself that a lot.”</p>
<p>“You maimed people,” Ashley said. Still on the offense.</p>
<p>“Long term injuries. Burns,” Rain said. “To people of all ages.”</p>
<p>“For fun?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>“For respect, if anything. I don’t know,” Rain said. He looked back to Chris, since he was really answering his question. “Because a large part of me had only ever known the family, the lifestyle. All of the language &mdash; outsiders were… less. It was okay to hurt ten of them if you helped one of the family’s.”</p>
<p>“They had your whole childhood to work on you,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t excuse it,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“No. But it explains it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Your whole life?” I asked. My first time speaking in this conversation, maybe. I wasn’t sure &mdash; I was in a different mode.</p>
<p>“My parents were early adopters, mostly on the fringe. They got more into it as it grew. Renamed me early enough I don’t remember my original name. Rain O’Fire Frazier.”</p>
<p>“That’s terrible,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Shush,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Everything about the Fallen is terrible,” Rain said. “A few years after the name change, they sold me to a family halfway across the country, used the money to fuck off traveling like they’d always talked about. My guardians right now are people I’ve called my aunt and uncle my whole life. I got powers with the cluster trigger, at a time I was just one more set of hands and a weapon, a henchman. That was supposed to elevate me and… it did the opposite. That was my wake-up call.”</p>
<p>“It’s good you had one,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the idea of you going back,” Sveta said. “When you pull away is when things get worse, when violence happens.”</p>
<p>“It’s why I’m not pulling away,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You’re with us,” Tristan said. “You’re doing your own thing.”</p>
<p>From the bank robbery to the period after. Trying to find normal again. Rain had been more open. Did that change the course of this particular river, compared to the one I’d known? Or were the key elements all there, still? The discomfort, the ‘I’m trying but I’m not going to do anything different’?</p>
<p>Did it still lead to disaster in the end?</p>
<p>“Is the critter okay?” Erin asked. “Kenz?”</p>
<p>“She’ll be fine if this ends and the group is still together,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Are we?” Rain asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to say no,” Sveta said. “But I think you need to <em>go</em>. Yesterday. Get out of there. Trust the Wardens.”</p>
<p>“I would if I thought they would protect me,” Rain said. “But they’re busy. The news articles say they’re not even <em>here</em> lot of the time.”</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” Tristan said. “This is ninety-five percent known stuff, and elaboration on other stuff.”</p>
<p>The voices of the others were a jumble. Chris didn’t care about anything. Ashley, as odd as it was, seemed most uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Victoria,” Rain said. “You’ve been quiet.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>I was aware of the silence that followed my statement.</p>
<p>“Snag’s army. They’re after the Fallen,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“But they want you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. His expression darkened as he said it. No illusions about what was in store for him if that happened.</p>
<p>“Because of the kids, and the others you killed. Because they blame you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“I can tell you the details, if&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I’m going to go,” I said, interrupting. I was aware of the looks I got. “Tell Kenzie everything’s cool. I’ll be back. I just need to think on this.”</p>
<p>No actions out of instinct. I’d think, piece everything together.</p>
<p>I flew away from the scene before I could say or do something I’d regret.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Another group was patrolling the area that afternoon. Crystal and I stood on a square of crimson forcefield, well above Cedar Point, watching.</p>
<p>They were an older group, a bit of armor, some swords, a spear. One of them was a Brute who carried a crossbow bigger than I was. I’d always liked those things.</p>
<p>Simple. Easy. Bad guys bad and a bit lame. Good guys a bit lame and doing good work.</p>
<p>“I’m going back to the PRTCJ,” Crystal said. “Next week.”</p>
<p>I didn’t want her to go back. There was very little to like about the group.</p>
<p>Ironically, the advice I was following in regards to that had to do with cults. Not putting up too much of an offense, not scaring them into throwing up walls.</p>
<p>“It’s been two weeks,” I said. “How do they handle that?”</p>
<p>“No idea. Pay deduction, extra drills, demotion.”</p>
<p>“I told you what I heard from D. There’s war on the horizon.”</p>
<p>D. Dido. In case we were being listened to. Prancer’s clairvoyants could have been listening in, and he could have hired additional intelligence gathering. No telling. We dodged particulars.</p>
<p>“That’s part of why I’m going,” Crystal said.</p>
<p>“Spooks me,” I said.</p>
<p>“You doing <em>this</em> spooks me,” Crystal said. “I want to meet everyone at some point.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“You think you have a handle on this?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” I said. If ‘this’ meant Cedar Point. “On other stuff? Less sure.”</p>
<p>“What can I do? We want you more sure.”</p>
<p>“Looks like our guests are free and clear. We’ll see what they say later. I’ve got a meeting. Do you mind flying with me?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to. But we gotta eat.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t hungry, I was rarely hungry after thinking too much about the past, and I’d been thinking about it a lot during the discussion with Rain. Still, I nodded.</p>
<p>I picked up the bag and the books I’d placed atop the field, putting everything away. Crystal dropped the forcefield, and we flew with me leading the way.</p>
<p>It was already getting dark. The flight wasn’t a short one. I put on my music, because conversation was hard with the wind in my ears.</p>
<p>Time to think about Crystal and the PRTCJ. The war with Earth C. Rain. Kenzie. About what the hell I was doing here.</p>
<p>The sun had set by the time we arrived. The waterfront had a railing with oversized posts a boat could be lashed to. I leaned against the railing, checked my phone, and sent a message.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada approached from our right. She had food from a nearby food truck.</p>
<p>“Crystal,” she said. “It’s so nice to see you.”</p>
<p>“You too,” Crystal said. She gushed just a bit as she said it. She’d met Mrs. Yamada at the hospital. They’d had talks about things. About Crystal losing Uncle Neil and Eric. About me.</p>
<p>There was a brief catching-up. Pleasantries. I chimed in once or twice, then found I didn’t have it in me. I stared out over the water.</p>
<p>“I think&mdash; do you mind giving us privacy?” Mrs. Yamada asked.</p>
<p>“Sure. How’s the food here?”</p>
<p>“This? It’s good.”</p>
<p>“Wave when you want me to come back. I’ll be enjoying the view until then.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Yamada leaned against the railing next to me. Her dinner smelled amazing and I still didn’t want to eat anything.</p>
<p>“Sorry to be eating while we talk. I haven’t had a bite to eat since grabbing a protein bar and a pear at five forty-five this morning.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I said. “Please eat. Thank you for seeing me.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Is everyone okay?”</p>
<p>“Intact, yes. Okay? Were they okay when I met them?”</p>
<p>“They were in a place where I felt like they could finish their own journeys. Most of them. I imagine there’s some backsliding here and there, difficulties and things that aren’t okay because of external stresses and internal factors within the group.”</p>
<p>“Some,” I said. “Some figuring things out from moment to moment. Small triumphs.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. More or less what I expected.”</p>
<p>“Rain revealed his situation,” I said.</p>
<p>“I heard,” Mrs. Yamada said. “You wanted to do some thinking.”</p>
<p>“I did,” I said.</p>
<p>“I can’t do that thinking for you. But if you want to talk out loud, I can help you along the way.”</p>
<p>“When it comes to Rain, I think I get it,” I said. “I’m not okay with it, but not in a way that’s going to ruin anything. It sucks to see the big and little things that affect the others. Some issues close to Sveta’s heart.”</p>
<p>“You’re thinking about something else,” she concluded.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “When Weld showed up at the first session, he said he was sorry he couldn’t sit in.”</p>
<p>“He did.”</p>
<p>“You asked him to counsel the group on their hero idea before you asked me.”</p>
<p>“Before the community center, before your boss called me. Yes.”</p>
<p>“He said no, but he could help in a while.”</p>
<p>“More or less.”</p>
<p>“But you chose me in the end. You could have waited and had him sit in, and he’s… a great guy who everyone respects. You chose me, for reasons besides timing.”</p>
<p>“I’m not much of a schemer.”</p>
<p>“That’s not saying I’m wrong,” I said.</p>
<p>“No it isn’t. But I’m worried if I say yes, then there’s expectations, and there’s disappointment if this doesn’t end up going well. I’m far from superhuman, I make mistakes, and this could be another. What are you thinking this is?”</p>
<p>“You wanted a quality I had, that Weld might not. I was thinking about the team, the traps we could fall into. Is it the paranoia? The fact I can’t quite trust people?”</p>
<p>“That seems like an unkind way to describe yourself.”</p>
<p>“It’s true.”</p>
<p>“Unkind, still.”</p>
<p>“You wanted someone that isn’t too enmeshed into the group. Someone wary that’s seen the Asylum and knows the sort of thing that comes out of there. Someone that might see how they operate within the dynamic now that most have let their guards down. You think something’s up, and you didn’t tell me what it is because you didn’t want me going in with too many preconceived ideas. Because… you wanted to see if I drew the same conclusions. Something bad’s in play with this group.”</p>
<p>She nodded to herself.</p>
<p>“Am I wrong?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You’re not wrong,” she said.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap43">Shade &mdash; Interlude 4c</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>She stared up at the ceiling, tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I didn’t give you warnings,” he said.</p>
<p>“I can’t change your mind?” she asked. It sounded like pleading, begging.</p>
<p>She looked at him. His head was shaved, his chin was marked with stubble, and he looked weary. The front door was ajar, the world outside dark. He had his jacket and shoes on, and he stood in the hallway, while she stood in the living room. The water hadn’t even dried from when he’d walked in from outdoors and it was clear in his body language he was about to go.</p>
<p>He took a long time to decide what to say.</p>
<p>“I’d say you could tell me things were going to be different&mdash;”</p>
<p>“They will.”</p>
<p>“&mdash;But you’ve told me it before,” he said. “I don’t believe your words anymore.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t just about me,” she said, raising her voice.</p>
<p>“Seventy-five percent me, twenty-five percent you, then,” he said.</p>
<p>“Don’t fucking reduce it to numbers,” she said, angry now.</p>
<p>“We’ve talked about this,” he said. His voice was calm, in stark contrast to hers. “I’ve tried to be fair. I outlined what needed to change. That you needed to take it easier and be more reliable. I don’t even know where you are some nights, and it’s <em>not</em> because of work.”</p>
<p>“It’s part of the job!” she said. Her voice echoed down the hallway, and the echo came back different. “It’s the work culture! How many times do I have to say it!?”</p>
<p>“I’ve outlined what needed to change. The therapist took my side. She thought it was fair. We agreed on rules, the therapist signed off on them, and you broke them,” he said. His voice was more weary than his expression was. “How many times have I had to get Ever out of bed late at night, get her things, and bring her to the hospital like that because you’ve gotten hurt? You’re a <em>mom</em>.”</p>
<p>“I’m a human being! I’m trying to find a balance!” Again, the echo, louder, jumbled, not going away as it bounced off of the walls, building and multiplying.</p>
<p>“She’s almost five. She’ll be in kindergarten this September. In the last four years and seven months, She’s learned to walk, talk, do some chores, and she’s going to go into school knowing some reading, adding, and subtracting. She’s figured all that out. Why can’t you figure out your balance in that same time?”</p>
<p>“Oh fuck you, Lee!”</p>
<p>“Dad?” the voice was small.</p>
<p>Lee turned and stepped aside. The little girl&mdash; Everly, she’d crept up, and now she stood in the hallway that went from the front hall toward the bedrooms, fidgeting with her nightgown.</p>
<p>“Oh, hon&mdash;” her words were nearly drowned out by the jumble of sound.</p>
<p>“Hey Ever!” Lee’s voice interrupted hers, positive, happy. Were the point of view not from the woman’s perspective, <em>Love Lost’s</em> perspective, then nobody would’ve heard the small, broken sound that escaped her throat. Another person might not have seen how the lens was watery, blurry at the bottom edges with tears.</p>
<p>Lee bent down and swept Ever up in his arms. “What are you doing out of bed?”</p>
<p>“You’re shouting.”</p>
<p>“No I’m not, goblin,” he said. He squeezed the girl in a hug. As he did, he turned, his face where Everly couldn’t see, and gave Love Lost an accusatory, disappointed look.</p>
<p><em>No I’m not. But she is</em>.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” Everly asked.</p>
<p>“I have to go away for a bit.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t going to say goodbye?”</p>
<p>“Were you?” Love Lost asked. She didn’t shout, but the words reverberated and echoed down the hallway and through the house as if she’d voiced the words with a megaphone.</p>
<p>Lee’s look was much fiercer, this time.</p>
<p>“It’s not goodbye,” Lee said, the gentle tone disconnected from expression. “I’m going to see you soon. Promise.”</p>
<p>“Wizards can’t lie, Daddy.”</p>
<p>“I know, baby.”</p>
<p>“And we’re wizards. It’s not allowed. It’s a pact of a promise.”</p>
<p>“I know. You and me, we’re wizards and we keep our word.”</p>
<p>Love Lost shook her head, looking away, elsewhere in the living room, down at her hand, which was clenched. When she opened her hand, her palm had a row of half-moon marks in it.</p>
<p>Lee set Everly down. “Go to your mom. Sorry, goblin, but I’ve got to go.”</p>
<p>Everly looked at her mom, hesitated, both hands on her dad’s leg, then obediently crossed the way.</p>
<p>Love Lost knelt on the living room rug, folding her daughter into a hug, her head buried in the little girl’s shoulder and hair.</p>
<p>“I’ll send you the papers by the end of the week,” Lee said.</p>
<p>Love Lost flinched, whole-body, as the door shut with a solid impact. The sound broke up as well, scattered, became a hundred trampling shoes and boots, bangs. Picture frames rattling became another kind of rattle, of things clattering, falling down.</p>
<p>The floodgates opened, and her arms still encircling Everly, she used her thumbs and fingers to try to wipe tears away. To keep Everly from seeing.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying? Mom?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Mom? What did I do?”</p>
<p>Her voice broke as she tried to speak. The noises were too loud&mdash; the jumble.</p>
<p>Her eyes were wrenched open as people pushed in close. Her surroundings were claustrophobic, not even accounting for all of the people. Folded tables and pallets on either side of her, many with papers stuck to them. The words ‘event’, ‘convention’ stood out on the paper. People pushed, shoved, and Love Lost pulled closer to the wall, put her head down, burying her face in her daughter’s hair.</p>
<p>“Mom,” was the faint sound, almost drowned out.</p>
<p>Love Lost looked. She made eye contact with her daughter, now grown, twelve or so years old. Makeup around her eyes was thick, bright, smudged. Strands of red hair with one strand bleached and colored blue had fallen across her face. Everly looked terrified.</p>
<p>People pushed past, and Love Lost did what she could to hug her daughter closer. The space between the piles of stuff might have seemed like a refuge at one point, but it wasn’t big enough for two people. Love Lost sat on the ground, her back to the wall, pulling Everly in as tight as she could.</p>
<p>A man squeezed by, and Love Lost looked down at where her hand gripped her daughter’s waist. The friction of the man pushing past had skinned the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Love Lost shouted, inarticulate, and her own voice was inaudible. Angry shouts, telling people to get back, to give space. Someone tried to stick a leg into the gap between her and the folded tables leaning against the wall to one side. The tables rattled as the picture frames had, a steady, endless, echoing drum.</p>
<p>Her daughter said something, but the noises&mdash; too much noise.</p>
<p><em>I can feel the vibration of her speaking against Love Lost’s chest,</em> Rain thought.</p>
<p>Love Lost screamed words at the crowd.</p>
<p>The pressure of the packed crowd was such that the stacked tables couldn’t handle it. Something gave, and the tables fell, sliding down against the ground, taking the legs out of a dozen people in the crowd. The result was a domino effect, people falling over and taking others with them. Others sought relief from pressure in moving over the crowd.</p>
<p>The ripple effect in the crowd was more like a tidal wave crashing through. One moment, where Love Lost’s eyes moved over the crowd, saw people falling, saw others pushing&mdash;</p>
<p>Her daughter was torn from her arms by the shift in the crowd. She watched, the scene slowing down, the noise dying out, fingers grasping, as Everly’s face was forced&mdash; <em>shoved</em> into the side of a table that hadn’t fully collapsed.</p>
<p>The only sound was the impact, a single, hard knock. The dull echo and the rattling.</p>
<p>Her eyes went first to the slash of red, the gap between nostril and teeth, where the upper lip had split. Then to Everly’s eyes, which pointed in slightly different directions, unfocused. Gone.</p>
<p>She reached for Everly and the movement of the crowd didn’t let her make contact. People moved in, stepping on her, on Everly’s body, and Love Lost fought, fierce, desperate, and <em>animal</em>.</p>
<p>A scream tore from her lips, a multi-note sound. Anger, desperation, despair, grief.</p>
<p>Love Lost leaned over the counter, hands at her temple, as the screaming on the television stopped, replaced by a jingle, jarring voices. Bugs danced on the screen, turning around to wiggle their rear ends, showing off the symbols stamped on their shells.</p>
<p>“Everlyn,” she said.</p>
<p>Her hands moved at her temple, and the scene distorted with the movements.</p>
<p>“Everlyn!” she raised her voice. The shout echoed through the apartment.</p>
<p>She heard the tromp of running feet. The sound echoed, became a part of the background noise.</p>
<p>“Yes mom?” the voice asked.</p>
<p>“Turn it down. That’s loud enough to bother the neighbors. And turn it off, if you’re not watching.”</p>
<p>“I was going to watch.”</p>
<p>“You were in your room.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to find someone to watch it with me.”</p>
<p>Love Lost looked over as two stuffed toys were placed on the counter’s edge. Ugly things, with twisted faces. One of them looked like a ballsack with arms, legs, and a bulldog face. Ugly toys were apparently the in thing. The other was alright. A princess doll with red hair.</p>
<p>“See?” Everlyn moved the toys, animating them with wiggles and moving a finger up to raise the princess’s arm.</p>
<p>“I see. Now turn it down.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>The toys were left where they were. A moment later, the volume of the children’s voices singing the repetitive song started dropping. The noise of the lingering echoes remained.</p>
<p>“Quieter,” Love Lost said. Her fingers moved at her temples, drawing her eyes into slits, as she stared down at the sink.</p>
<p>The sound of the television dropped again. The two toys were whisked away from the edge of the counter.</p>
<p>“<em>Thank you</em>,” Love Lost said, raising her voice to be heard as the footsteps retreated at a run. She drew in a deep breath and sighed, aggrieved.</p>
<p>The peace lasted about five seconds. Something crashed, a loud sound that cascaded, as if <em>everything</em> had fallen down.</p>
<p>“Sorry!” Everlyn called out, from the other end of the house, her voice high. “I’ll clean it up!”</p>
<p>Love Lost raised herself up straight, then went to the kitchen cupboard, retrieving a bottle of headache pills. She doled out two into her hand. The stem of a wine glass was briefly visible as she washed them down.</p>
<p>The theme song had ended, and the television was high cartoon voices, now.</p>
<p>Love Lost buried her face in her hands and sighed.</p>
<p>“Mom?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Mom.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Everlyn?” Love Lost’s voice could only be described as barely restrained, slightly muffled with her face still in her hands.</p>
<p>“Can I show you something?”</p>
<p>“How bad is the mess?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that. I’ll clean it up after. Can I show you something?”</p>
<p>“Can it wait? Please? I’m not up for it right now.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Love Lost remained where she was. The sounds in the background settled into a throbbing sync. The television show broke away to show ads, high cartoon voices replaced with adult announcers touting toys and kids screaming their glee in response.</p>
<p>She raised her head up, and a slice of color caught her eye. She looked&mdash; the princess doll, sitting on the edge of the counter. The weight of the doll held down a little booklet.</p>
<p>She set the doll aside, noting the paper shield stuck to the arm with two pieces of clear tape. The cover of the book had two women on it, both with red hair.</p>
<p>The woman in a dress with the shield was in the book, alongside a figure that wasn’t supposed to be a woman, but Everly. A child drawing herself as larger and more prominent, with a scarf drawn overlong, sprawling out over the page.</p>
<p>The red-haired wizard had once had a teacher but he was gone. There was only the knight who had ‘raised her up’, who had red hair like her. The knight ‘detected’ crimes and was always very tired and very grumpy.</p>
<p>Children on the television in the background shrieked. The sound became a growing echo of screams.</p>
<p>Love Lost’s vision blurred slightly, and she paged through. The lead-in to the book took a long time, and the confrontation at the end was brief, as the demon was slain.</p>
<p>Love Lost looked away, at a small collection of empty bottles on the counter, tucked beside the microwave and the wall, set out of reach.</p>
<p>She finished looking through the book’s ending. She closed it, hand pressing down the front cover so it would lie flat instead of sticking straight up. The teacher’s sticker was in the corner, a tiny superhero silhouette holding up a giant ‘A+’. The teacher had penned out a response, saying in length how much they loved it.</p>
<p>Love Lost’s thumbnail dragged against the construction paper, scratching the words the teacher had put down, the edge of the nail finding the grooves where the pen nib had dug into the softer paper.</p>
<p>She pressed the book to her chest, and picked up the doll. The paper shield came undone, and she carefully pressed the tape back into place along the doll’s arm.</p>
<p>She walked down the hallway, then pushed open the door.</p>
<p>Toys and stuffed animals were scattered across the floor. Love Lost’s eyes roved, over posters on the wall, mostly wizard things, more of the goblins.  Homework assignments and one picture of Lee were taped to the wall, at waist height and below.</p>
<p>An eight year old Everly was on her bed, surrounded by toys. She watched her mother, expression solemn.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I forgot to turn off the tv,” Everlyn said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Everlyn looked at the closet. A set of metal poles with baskets had been pulled down, bringing down the basket from the back of the door in the process. The stuffed animals from within had been emptied onto the floor of the room, with one pole leaning against the child-size chair in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Everlyn nodded.</p>
<p>“I love this,” Love Lost said, pressing the book against her heart.</p>
<p>Everlyn smiled, “You do?”</p>
<p>“I love everything about it,” Love Lost said, for emphasis.</p>
<p>“There are parts I worried you wouldn’t like.”</p>
<p>“I love it all,” Love Lost said. “Can I sit?”</p>
<p>Everlyn moved over so her mother could sit down beside her. She took the doll back.</p>
<p>“When you wanted a scarf for Christmas, did you want one like this? Like&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I like the one you gave me.”</p>
<p>“But did you want one like this?” Love Lost looked at pictures on the wall. The sound of her own heartbeat echoed, the sounds that the television spat out growing louder in the distance, like an onrushing train. She pointed. “Like that?”</p>
<p>Everlyn nodded, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“What do you say we go shopping later? We’ll see what we can find.”</p>
<p>Everlyn nodded, emphatic. “Yes please.”</p>
<p>Love Lost reached for her daughter and wrapped her in a hug.</p>
<p>“I’m going to try to be a better mom, okay?”</p>
<p>Everlyn nodded.</p>
<p>Everlyn pulled to one side. The movement of people around her tugged her, threatening to pull her from her mother’s arms. Her expression was so afraid.</p>
<p>Again, just as before, down to the last detail, the pressure of the packed crowd was such that the stacked tables couldn’t handle it. The tables fell, sliding out and across the floor, bowling over a section of the crowd. Again, the domino effect, again, people fell over and knocked or pulled others down with them.</p>
<p>Again, people climbed over the fallen.</p>
<p>Once again, the sound seemed to fade. Once again, things moved in slow motion as Love Lost’s eyes moved along the same path, noting the same details, the same imminent result.</p>
<p>Her daughter was torn from her arms. Love Lost watched as Everly’s face was driven into the side of a half-fallen table.</p>
<p>Again, the only sound was the impact, a single, hard knock. The dull echo and the clatter after the fact.</p>
<p>Love Lost’s eyes traveled the exact same path as before, as if moving along a groove. First to the slash of red, the gap between nostril and teeth, where the upper lip had split. Then to Everly’s eyes, which each moved independently of the other. Gone.</p>
<p>The dull echo of the impact against the table was the only sound as she reached for her daughter. The movement of the crowd didn’t let her make contact. People moved in, trampling the two of them, separating them, and Love Lost fought, with nothing knightly or good about how she clawed with fingernails.</p>
<p>A sound tore from her lips, a sound in many parts, for a feeling that couldn’t be put to words or wordless scream.</p>
<p>Then that sound, too, went quiet.</p>
<p>Tear-blurred vision with light from the windows slicing in through the brief gaps that appeared between people became something else. Light on the horizon.</p>
<p>Love Lost sat with a ten year old Everlyn, facing the water, and the soft glow on the far side of it. All around them, people milled, noisy.</p>
<p>“Do you want to do anything?” she asked.</p>
<p>Everlyn looked up at her, confused, then looked back.</p>
<p>Love Lost followed her daughter’s eyes. The orb of the sun was behind them, peeking in between buildings.</p>
<p>She turned to look at the light on the horizon. Gold.</p>
<p>“Do anything?” Everlyn asked.</p>
<p>“We could go to the ice cream truck over there, and see if we can get anything.”</p>
<p>Her daughter looked at her as if she was crazy.</p>
<p>“We could go to the shelters, but I don’t think it would help.”</p>
<p>People ran this way and that. Not sure where to go. Love Lost seemed determined to stay still, stay calm.</p>
<p>She reached for her daughter’s hand, and that hand trembled as she took it in hers.</p>
<p>As if something had swept over it, the water briefly went still, every wave stopping, the ocean appearing as a flat expanse of ice or glass for the briefest moment.</p>
<p>The golden light flared, and it took nearly five seconds before the effect touched the water, breaking the spell. The ground shook as the effect carried into the ground beneath them, and some people who were running lost their balance.</p>
<p>Everlyn’s hands went to her mouth. One was the hand that Love Lost held. Love Lost gathered both hands up in her own.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why the ice cream,” Everlyn said. A sentence garbled by confusion and stress.</p>
<p>“I wasted so much time. I thought&mdash;”</p>
<p>She didn’t finish the statement.</p>
<p>Her daughter gave her a look, confused.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do,” Love Lost said.</p>
<p>“Hug me,” Everlyn said.</p>
<p>Love Lost hugged her daughter without hesitation or reserve, burying her face in Everlyn’s hair.</p>
<p>“Too tight. That hurts,” Everlyn said.</p>
<p>The sound of the crowd mounted, the distant rumbles and rattling echoing. People brushed across Love Lost’s arm, in greater and greater numbers&mdash;</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Rain found himself in the room. He didn’t reach for the chair. He didn’t move.</p>
<p>The view of Gold Morning had been the third of seven scenes.</p>
<p>All punctuated by the same repeated event.</p>
<p>It had been the same way, every fifth night for the last year, with little variation. Sometimes more scenes, sometimes less. He’d seen all of these before.</p>
<p>It never hit him any less hard.</p>
<p>Snag was up, standing at the dais. Cradle, too, had approached it. Rain could hear the murmurs of their conversation.</p>
<p>He hated to look, but he looked.</p>
<p>Love Lost was in the small chair. The same chair that had been in Everlyn’s room.</p>
<p>Rain recognized the stuffed animals, the toys, and the little belongings. Nothing too personal, none of the wizard pictures. None of the swords-and-sorcery superhero stuff that the more moody eleven and twelve year old Everlyn had kept on her wall. None of the toys were ones she’d indicated any attachment to.</p>
<p>Hollow.</p>
<p>Love Lost sat in the chair, limp, not twitching a finger or shifting her posture. Tears marked her cheeks, darkened with the makeup from around her eyes. Unblinking, tears flowing, she glared at Rain.</p>
<p>It was disconcerting to see someone cry and not blink or move.</p>
<p>He hated this. He hated seeing that and he couldn’t imagine what it did to Love Lost. He hated that it took something away from the sympathy, that he had to temper it with his awareness of her wanting him dead.</p>
<p>She had been a deeply flawed person, but that didn’t make the love, the pain, or the resulting emotion any less felt. Just the opposite, in the end.</p>
<p>She poured hate into her glare as if she could somehow make Rain feel the loathing and anger.</p>
<p>With the personality bleed, he thought, she probably could.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Rain felt his heart sink further as Victoria flew higher.</p>
<p>“Crazy,” Erin said.</p>
<p>He looked back at her. She still stood by the door of her dad’s car. She looked so weary. “Me?”</p>
<p>“Her. The flying, I mean. It’s crazy to go from a conversation to seeing someone take off and disappear into the sky like that.”</p>
<p>He’d wanted to convince Victoria more than anyone. She was the least biased in his favor because she hadn’t spent so long in group therapy, listening to his side of things, empathizing and sharing with him. A part of him had wanted to get her on his side because she wasn’t that far from all of the strangers he walked past or took the train with every day&mdash; every person who he knew would hate him if they knew his full, unfiltered story.</p>
<p>In the background, Kenzie had stood up. She was looking in Victoria’s direction. Sveta broke away from the group to approach her. Disconcerting, in a very different way, to see how Sveta turned her head away, and she hadn’t fixed her hair since moving it away. The thin-ness of her face, the fact that the only thing behind it was the muscle-like bundle of finger-thin tendrils.</p>
<p>He hadn’t seen that often. It reminded him of catching a glimpse of Erin’s bra strap. Something hidden, that he wasn’t supposed to see. It left him feeling uncomfortable in a completely different way.</p>
<p>Disconcerting, to see Sveta looking at him, catching him looking, and the anger and hurt in her eyes. He thought of Love Lost.</p>
<p>Sveta was one of the kindest people he knew. Having <em>her</em> angry at him? It sucked. But Peat and Fen had been the closest thing she’d had to kin for a long time.</p>
<p>He couldn’t wrap his head around that, because he’d never had real <em>kin</em>. He’d never been in one place for long enough, he’d never been welcomed.</p>
<p>“You look like you’re in shock,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Rain blinked. Was he? “I&mdash; for a long time, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Did you talk to Mrs. Yamada?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday afternoon. She helped me work up the courage to come. You were right. They all needed to know.”</p>
<p>Tristan nodded.</p>
<p>He was aware of the subset of the group that had gathered. Ashley, Tristan, Chris, and himself, with Erin in the background. He looked back at Erin.</p>
<p>He knew the accusation Moonsong had leveled against Tristan, and he had an idea of what that was about. Ashley hadn’t hidden her past. Three out of the five people present had killed in the past. It was disorienting, to track the number as it climbed.</p>
<p>Sveta had an especially bloody past. She’d even gotten blood on her hands after <em>leaving</em> the Asylum.</p>
<p>“Has Victoria ever killed anyone?” Rain asked, before he realized he was asking it.</p>
<p>The reaction was as one might expect. Blinks. Surprise from Tristan. A snort and smile from Chris.</p>
<p>“What are you asking?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“I thought the admission I’d killed people would have had more impact than the things the Fallen has done in the past,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I can’t speak for the others, but I guessed,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Someone doesn’t have your kind of guilt without something that bad or worse,” Ashley said. “You didn’t think you had a choice.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Rain said. “But it doesn’t change what I did.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Ashley said. “When I was talking to the group about understanding what I’d done and how, I knew that sometimes Mrs. Yamada would say things and it wasn’t to me. Most of the time, when you asked about things, it wasn’t about me, it was about you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Ashley shook her head. She looked the way Victoria had gone. “She hasn’t killed anyone before, if I had to guess.”</p>
<p>“Just Victoria and the kids, then.”</p>
<p>“Just Victoria and Kenzie,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Rain looked at Chris. Chris shrugged. “Accidental.”</p>
<p>“Only Victoria and Kenzie. Sounds right,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“Christ,” Rain said, under his breath.</p>
<p>“You talking like that was what got me asking about you and Church, remember?” Tristan asked. He folded his arms. “What’s your plan?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to drive Erin back tonight. If it’s okay, I’ll get together with the group tomorrow. I’ve got some junk for you to drop off, if that’s okay.”</p>
<p>“What kind of junk?” Chris asked.</p>
<p>“Bear traps, wire guillotines, blades without handles.”</p>
<p>“Really,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“He’s not lying,” Erin said. “I helped him load the car.”</p>
<p>“They’re going to come after me. I’m going to plan accordingly. I’ll cover my escape route, and I’ll make sure I’m armed if they close the distance.”</p>
<p>“They run on walls,” Chris said. “Or jump onto walls.”</p>
<p>“I’ll cover the ground,” Rain said, firm. “I’ll figure something out for the walls.”</p>
<p>“I can help some with that. I’m going the anxiety route, so I’ll be crawling up the walls for the next few days. I can give you some perspective on where to put traps.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“You want to set traps… around the headquarters?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“And some place we can retreat to if we go into Cedar Point and have to retreat out of. It’s going to be hard to find places that work that won’t put civilians in the target area.”</p>
<p>“You can talk to Kenzie for that,” Chris said. “Make them remotely armed.”</p>
<p>“Okay, wait, stop, stop,” Tristan said. “Is this really what we’re doing?”</p>
<p>“It’s what <em>I’m</em> doing,” Rain said. “For this specific scenario, as a just-in case. I have to do something, and this is stuff I know about.”</p>
<p>Tristan ran his fingers through his hair. He turned to Erin, asked, “Are you okay with this?”</p>
<p>“A while ago, I wouldn’t have been,” she said. She set her jaw a bit, “But I have a gun now, and I know how to use it. Half of the reason I’m carrying it is in case those people come after Rain, or if they come after me as a way of hurting him.”</p>
<p>Rain felt so sad, hearing that.</p>
<p>Sadder, at knowing the other reason she had it.</p>
<p>He hated this. He hated that he saw Tristan here, looking so distressed. He hated that Sveta was so upset, that Victoria was gone, that Kenzie wasn’t rejoining the conversation when being left out was something that bothered her so much.</p>
<p>He hated himself, for being at the crux of so much of that. He could remember Love Lost’s penetrating glare.</p>
<p>How much of this self-loathing stemmed from her loathing of him?</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to say,” Tristan said. “Guns and maiming?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to say anything,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I feel like <em>someone</em> needs to say something,” Tristan said. He looked around the group, at Ashley, Chris, Rain. He looked back at Sveta and Kenzie. “Shit, out of the four of us, it’s supposed to be up to <em>me</em> to make the moral argument?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to argue,” Rain said. “Really, I get it. It’s shitty, but I thought all day yesterday about this. I’ve got to do something.”</p>
<p>Tristan paced a little, then walked a short distance away. He muttered something under his breath.</p>
<p>It was Byron who walked the same short distance back.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Byron said. “I’m supposed to talk to you, I guess, since Tristan can’t figure out how to.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to stay alive,” Rain said. “I can’t lie down and die, and the only way I can figure out how to get through this is to be a little more vicious. I’ve been in these guys heads for a year. They <em>will</em> kill. They hate me that much.”</p>
<p>Images of Everlyn flickered through Rain’s mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Byron was nodding.</p>
<p>“Kill or be killed,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Me being killed might be deserved,” Rain added.</p>
<p>“You don’t deserve to be tortured to death,” Erin said. “And I don’t believe in death for crimes committed either. Only in self defense, if there aren’t other options.”</p>
<p>“Death is a reality when powers come into play and people aren’t willing to play nice. It’s why so many of us have body counts. Other teams aren’t that different, I’m sure,” Ashley said. “A lot of powers don’t come with a ‘stun’ option. A lot of other powers don’t come as part and parcel with power-users who would or could use that option if they had it.”</p>
<p>Rain shook his head.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you deserve the torture and-or murder kind of end either,” Byron said. “I’m not going to say no to the traps, or to Erin’s gun. If it comes to staying alive, use them. Do whatever you have to that doesn’t put others in harm’s way.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“I’m going to say some other stuff, though,” Byron said. His expression was so different from Tristan’s. More serious by default than Tristan’s was when Tristan was being serious. His words had weight, even spoken more quietly. “I’m going to tick Tristan off, saying this, but I’m going to start off by saying I really don’t like the team idea.”</p>
<p>“That’s going to tick him off, yeah,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“The idea has good parts to it,” Byron said. “It’s even cool to see people like Ashley and Kenzie talking about team names, getting excited about costumes. But that’s where they’re at, Rain. They’re still figuring it out. Victoria is focused on that right now, I think. A lot of talk of costumes and names.”</p>
<p>“We talked about that a fair bit,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“The shitty part of the idea?” Byron asked. “The thing that worries me? It’s the idea that the worst things might bubble to the surface and get in the way of this being genuine or good. Chris is talking about Kenzie making components or alerts for traps that are going to potentially <em>maim</em>? No. That’s… really not right.”</p>
<p>“You’re talking about me?” Kenzie asked, smiling as she asked it.</p>
<p>“Maiming?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>The pair were rejoining the group, after their heart-to heart.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about how far we’re willing to go to save Rain,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s obvious. All the way,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. “Not if it compromises stuff. Byron’s right.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to take serious measures, I think it should be separate from the team,” Byron said, quiet and serious. “Let them be heroes. Be a hero with them, with that other stuff being secondary. Keep it away from the hideout and headquarters.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean these guys can’t help you,” Byron said. “It means that if you’re planning on matching your enemy in preparing to go to war, you can’t ask others unequivocally to come with you.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded again. He felt something bitter well up deep inside, and his expression twisted as he looked away.</p>
<p>“I missed stuff,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you after,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Sorry Rain,” Byron said. “Take that as advice from someone in the diminishing population of people with reasonably clean hands. Advice from someone who had a <em>very</em> close up view of hands getting unclean.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t ruin them,” Rain said, looking at the group.</p>
<p>“Escalate if you have to, but don’t make it part of how the team operates,” Byron said. “Because yeah, that might ruin them.”</p>
<p>“You’re overestimating how intact we were when we started,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“I’m <em>estimating</em> that the team started from a place of healing and support,” Byron said. “If this is going to work out at all, and I really don’t think it is, sorry Tristan, it needs to hold on to that.”</p>
<p>“I like that,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Byron said.</p>
<p>Ruined. Rain had a sick feeling in his gut. He looked back at Erin.</p>
<p>“I’ve spent nearly two years living with the Fallen,” Erin said. She smiled, but her heart wasn’t really behind it. “Don’t go thinking you ruined me, because they’ve got dibs.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make me feel better,” Rain said.</p>
<p>He was struck with the urge, almost panic-level, yet driven by that strong core he’d spent all of yesterday trying to dig up, to say something that would maybe save Erin. To tell the others to grab her, or to not let her go back. He could tell the truth and it might even work, or he could lie, and it would work slightly better, but be limited more to the short term.</p>
<p>She had a gun and she had it partially because she was his friend and she wanted to protect him.</p>
<p>She had it, in part, to protect herself against the people she was going back to.</p>
<p>“Thank you for hearing me out,” he said to the group. “I guess I’ll see what Victoria says or does tomorrow. If I’m welcome.”</p>
<p>“I think you are,” Sveta said. “And I think Erin is too, but we’ll discuss if we’re okay having her in the headquarters. If we aren’t, we’ll still hang out, talk, make sure everything’s good.”</p>
<p>“That sounds nice,” Erin said. “I could do with more friends than just Rain.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. Privately, he wanted that for Erin too. Especially if something happened to him, he wanted her to have people to reach out to.</p>
<p>“I wish you weren’t going back at all, Rain,” Sveta said. “I can’t say it enough.”</p>
<p><em>I wish</em> <em>I wasn’t going back either</em>, Rain thought. <em>I wish I wasn’t taking Erin back</em>.</p>
<p>Byron blurred, his eyes flaring as he became Tristan.</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said. “I appreciate you stepping in, sorry for pushing you into that conversation. I need to think. Take the rest of my time.”</p>
<p>There was another blur. Tristan became Byron again.</p>
<p>“It’s late,” Rain said. “I think&mdash; we’ll go back?”</p>
<p>Erin nodded.</p>
<p>“Want a ride, By?” Rain offered. “To the station?”</p>
<p>Byron nodded.</p>
<p>“Anyone else?” Erin asked. Rain wished she hadn’t, but waited patiently while the others discussed.</p>
<p>They were going back to the headquarters, to check tapes and discuss, and to prepare for another patrol group that was going to do a walk-through of Cedar Point. It would just be Byron, Rain, and Erin in the car. Sveta had maybe noticed that Rain wanted to talk to his closer friends, and had steered the group’s arrangement slightly.</p>
<p>They three of them got in Erin’s dad’s car, leaving the traps and other junk in the boot. Rain took the passenger seat, suppressing his grunts and groans of pain as bruises made themselves felt. Byron took the back seat.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk to his friend, and he wasn’t sure how. The first fifteen minutes of the drive were agony, in a way.</p>
<p>Any other time, he would have been just fine with the fact that Byron was someone who seemed content to be quiet, to not make conversation.</p>
<p>They reached the train station, and Erin pulled into a parking spot.</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell them about the room,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“The room?” Erin asked.</p>
<p>“Dream thing,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Should I get out of the car or plug my ears or something?”</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said. “I trust you.”</p>
<p>“Nah. You boys talk. I’m going to run to the vending machine, since it’s a long drive. You can fill me in on the way back if you want.”</p>
<p>She climbed out of the car.</p>
<p>Rain watched her go, feeling a pang of sadness.</p>
<p>“She looks stressed,” Byron observed.</p>
<p>“Bad day yesterday. It’s starting to catch up with her, Fallen being Fallen.”</p>
<p>“And even like this she’s so stunning it sucks the air out of the room,” Byron said.</p>
<p>Rain looked in the direction Erin had gone. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you do it.”</p>
<p>“I’m not doing it. Not well.”</p>
<p>Rain wasn’t just talking about Erin.</p>
<p>“Today wasn’t easy,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“Last night wasn’t easy. If I wasn’t forced to sleep I’d have been up all night freaking out. Instead I had to have some of the shittiest memory-dreams, and then put on a poker face so I wouldn’t show any weakness to the people who want me dead.”</p>
<p>Byron thought for a moment, then said, “Last night was Love Lost?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Byron echoed him.</p>
<p>“You said something about the air being sucked out of the room, and I feel like it’s always that way. I can’t breathe, I can’t focus, I go from one bad moment to the next and I don’t even get the mercy of sleep. That’s without even taking Erin into account. Who’s&mdash;”</p>
<p>“You love her.”</p>
<p>Rain reeled at the idea.</p>
<p>“I don’t blame you. I don’t think anyone would.”</p>
<p>“I&mdash; I spent all of last night watching someone have the one person they cared about most in the world get torn from them over and over again. Then I saw the aftermath. Hurting Erin would be the one way they could do that to me. I guess I do.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Byron said. “I think anyone in your situation, in <em>ours</em>, in this kind of thing, if they had someone being nice and cool, they’d cling to that. Love would be natural and inevitable.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded.</p>
<p>“But Erin’s special, I think. She’s someone you could fall in love with, in <em>any</em> situation, not just one where she’s the one port in an ugly storm.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain’s voice was hollow.</p>
<p>“Be good to her,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“I can’t,” Rain replied. “Because the most ‘good’ thing I could do for her would be to kidnap her and take her away from all of this. But if I did, she’d never talk to me again, and I’d lose my mind without her having my back. I hate myself for it.”</p>
<p>Byron was silent.</p>
<p>“Instead, I’ve got to drive back with her, take her back to <em>that</em>. Actual, serious danger. I feel like I’m going to panic any second, I can’t figure out a clear way out, you’re right that I can’t drag the others into it, so there’s a part of it I have to do myself, the uglier, more monstrous part and&mdash;”</p>
<p>“That’s hard,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’m strong enough. That’s why I decided at the last minute I couldn’t tell them about the room. If I did, I feel like they’d read a selfish undercurrent into things.”</p>
<p>“It would tie your hands,” Byron said.</p>
<p>“It&mdash; kind of. The room, and how the powers are doled out. It incentivizes us killing each other. I’m weak. I’m <em>really</em> weak. If I kill them, I probably get stronger. That’s my only way out, and if I admit it to the team, and if one of the cluster die, it’s going to be something entirely different from most of us having taken lives in the past, under duress or before the amnesty. It’s going to be real and <em>now</em>.”</p>
<p>Byron nodded slowly, looking out the window.</p>
<p>“Does that change how you see me? That I’m seriously thinking about killing them?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Byron said. “It doesn’t surprise me. I don’t exactly blame you, or blame you for not wanting to tell the others.”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“But if you want to have that conversation, I think you should have it with Tristan, not me. You sound an awful lot like he did, and I don’t think he liked how it ended up.”</p>
<p>Byron opened the car door. He put a hand on Rain’s shoulder, brief, as he made his exit from the vehicle. He crossed paths with Erin, who was returning, accepted a chocolate bar from her, and disappeared around the corner.</p>
<p>Erin dumped the collection of junk food onto the space between the two front seats, then put the sodas in an empty trash bin on the floor of the car, so they wouldn’t roll around.</p>
<p>“Good talk?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>“I thought you two needed the elbow room,” she said. “Sugar and caffeine is for if you want to stay awake on the way back.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Rain was startled awake by a hand at his shoulder. Candy wrappers fell from his lap as he sat up straighter.</p>
<p>It was dark out, Erin was in the driver’s seat, face illuminated by the reflection of her headlights.</p>
<p>She looked spooked.</p>
<p>The path to the camp cut through woods, and the boundary where the area had been cleared out and the settlement began was marked with posts and a signboard that hung overhead. ‘Abandon all hope, all ye who enter here’.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a cute reference. It seemed apt now. Standing around the two posts, on either side of the road, were Tim, Jay, Nell, Levi, Amos, Ruby and Naomi.</p>
<p>Tim was the oldest in the group. His mask was a horse’s head, cut up, twisted around, and rigged to work as a mask. The mouth pointed up and to one side, teeth bared. Tim’s eye peered through the open eye socket of the horse’s, the back of the head and cheek of the horse serving to house the roll of Tim’s chin. He was tattooed heavily, with more black ink than pale white skin, all textured by heavy body hair. It was macabre enough it didn’t look ridiculous, especially in the stark light of the car’s headlights.</p>
<p>Not Tim, not really. <em>Seir.</em></p>
<p>The teenagers were in civilian clothes, the crevices of their face cast into shadow by the angled light. Jay had his mask in hand, long hair held back by his baseball cap.</p>
<p>Erin’s hand went to the gearshift.</p>
<p>To park?</p>
<p>No. To reverse.</p>
<p>“No,” Rain said.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t work, they wouldn’t get away, and they’d be punished for trying, as sure as they would be any other time they tried to make a break for it.</p>
<p>“Just… drive,” he told her. “Slowly.”</p>
<p>Seir walked over, as the car crept forward. He stopped by Erin’s car door, peering at them with the one eye.</p>
<p>“Cozy,” The side of the horse’s head parted as Tim spoke, a slit opening up between temple and the joint of the jaw.</p>
<p>Erin kept her eyes forward.</p>
<p>“What have I told you about not ignoring me?” Seir asked.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, sir,” Erin said, turning her head to look at him. Her neck and jaw were stiff.</p>
<p>Seir’s eye shifted, looking at Rain.</p>
<p>“My brother-in-law beat the shit out of you,” Seir said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rain said. “He did. I literally asked for it, though.”</p>
<p>“So I heard. What candy is that?”</p>
<p>Rain felt in the dark cab of the car, until his hand rustled a bag that wasn’t empty. “Grape apes.”</p>
<p>Seir reached his hand through the window, and Erin twisted her face away. The hand was held out, and Rain placed the bag of candy in it.</p>
<p>Seir ripped the bag open, and put a handful of purple monkey gummies into his mouth. He chewed noisily.</p>
<p>“Your repeated absences have been noticed,” Seir said, mouth full.</p>
<p>Rain was silent.</p>
<p>“Buying candy?” Seir asked.</p>
<p>“And using the internet, doing research on powers.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Going into the city. Shopping.”</p>
<p>Seir chewed more candy. He didn’t ask any questions, and Rain didn’t volunteer anything.</p>
<p>The bag of candy was about the size of two fists put side-to-side. As time passed, Seir rummaged in the bag, found more, chewed them, cramming more into the slit in the horse’s head before he was even done with the last mouthful. He must have finished three quarters of the bag as the silence stretched on, his one eye on the pair.</p>
<p>Erin flinched as Seir tossed the mostly empty bag into her lap.</p>
<p>“Leadership wants a chat with you,” Seir said.</p>
<p>Rain had been sleeping minutes ago, but now he was more than awake. Those words&mdash; if he’d gone straight to bed, no longer bound by the rhythm of his power and the demands of the room, even being as tired as he was, he wouldn’t have been able to sleep. Not after hearing that.</p>
<p>“With&mdash;” he started. He wanted to word it right. Couldn’t show weakness. “Me? Now?”</p>
<p>If he asked if that invitation included Erin, Seir might say yes, just out of spite, might make her go.</p>
<p><em>Please don’t make Erin go</em>.</p>
<p>“You. We were to wait and bring you as soon as you turned up. Which is now,” Seir said.</p>
<p>Rain opened the car door. He didn’t look at Erin, he didn’t say a word. He got out of the vehicle. He closed the door.</p>
<p>She drove away, through the settlement center, to her parents’ house.</p>
<p>Rain was left with his escort.</p>
<p>They talked among themselves, but they avoided talking to him. Seir remained close, ready to push at Rein’s back or shoulder if he dragged his feet. The rest were a half-circle behind and to either side of them. They talked among themselves, but they avoided talking to him.</p>
<p>Fear driving his senses to the next level, Rain was very aware of the smell of the grape apes. A candy he’d never be able to eat or smell again without feeling nauseous.</p>
<p>If he even got that far.</p>
<p>The house wasn’t even two years old, but it looked older, because the white paint on the wooden slat exterior was haphazardly applied, brush strokes long and the paint allowed to go thin. There was a white-painted fence, and none of the teenaged escorts went past the gate. They stopped beyond, standing guard there.</p>
<p>The front door was unlocked. Rain was ushered inside, the door was gently closed, and Rain was made to walk further.</p>
<p>In the living room, six of the senior Fallen were seated. Drinks sat on side tables, assorted snacks sat on a platter on the coffee table. The domestic scene was made eerie by the masks they wore. Demonic faces, many homemade. Several had been farm animals, the flesh altered with the power of a man Rain didn’t see present, so the pigs and sheep would have half-human, distorted faces before they were killed and skinned. Women in nice dresses with nice hair had heavy tattoos that reached up their necks and beneath their masks. A man wore the hide of an animal around his waist, wearing no shirt so the letters carved out and left to scar on his belly and chest would be visible.</p>
<p>Rain could trace his family connection to most of those present.</p>
<p>He could trace his connection to the meek young women who stood by, ready to serve anything requested. The one with her back to Rain had old lines of red dots soaked through the back of her blouse, criss-crossing.</p>
<p>The assembly was silent, wordless, watching from behind masks as Rain was urged to the stairs.</p>
<p>Even Seir didn’t go upstairs if he could help it.</p>
<p>Rain felt every ache and pain, every human doubt he’d experienced over the past two days, as he ascended those ten stairs. The second floor was spartan, with a long rug, a small table with a vase of wilted flowers on it, and a light overhead. The hallway extended to rooms to the left and the right.</p>
<p>He knew the door was to the left, but he looked the other way, as if there could somehow be an out.</p>
<p>He saw Lachlan, standing in the hallway, toothbrush sticking out of his mouth. He reached up to pull the toothbrush free.</p>
<p>“Rain,” Lachlan said, smiling. His voice was a hush. “Hey, good to see you.”</p>
<p>Rain didn’t have the words to respond. It was surreal, seeing Lachlan here.</p>
<p>“Did you talk to Allie?” Lachlan asked.</p>
<p>Rain stared at Lachlan. “Not the time, Lachlan.”</p>
<p>“Leave the boy be, Lachlan,” Seir said.</p>
<p>A faint thump from the left end of the hallway made all of their heads turn.</p>
<p>One of the meek servant-girls from the living room stepped into the hallway to stand next to Seir, even though she looked like she didn’t want to. She looked up, checking.</p>
<p>“Go,” Seir said.</p>
<p>Rain didn’t need to be told. He walked to the end of the hallway. The doorknob squeaked.</p>
<p>The inside of the room wasn’t all that decorated. Dresser, bedside table, and a four-poster bed with sheer drapes winding up the posts.</p>
<p>“Mama,” he said.</p>
<p>She wasn’t his mother, but it was how she was addressed.</p>
<p>Rain averted his eyes, but he could see the white drape of the nightgown, the feet on the floor. She was sitting so the post and the sheer drape kept him from seeing a lot of her.</p>
<p>But he saw some. Her presence jumped into his head. He looked away, but it didn’t help.</p>
<p>Mama Mathers. Taller than him, gaunt, wispy of hair. She wasn’t old, but she had the presence of an old woman, thin enough that it seemed like she would break or crumple into a heap if struck. She stood right next to him, leaning over him. She touched his face, and he flinched.</p>
<p>“You’ve been pulling away,” she said. Her voice was just as ethereal as the rest of her. “There is no away, Rain. You should know that.”</p>
<p>He remained still, trying not to look.</p>
<p>“We give the young ones so many allowances, and we’ve given you more than most. We thought you would find yourself. Have you?”</p>
<p>“Working on it,” he said, his voice quiet.</p>
<p>“How long has it been since we last talked?”</p>
<p>“Years, mama,” he said.</p>
<p>Her fingers traced his shoulder-length hair. “I told you to grow your hair long, back then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mama,” he said.</p>
<p>“Do you remember why? Any boy of mine that does anything to catch my eye, good or bad, I have them do it.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. No words would have come out if he’d said anything, so he didn’t try.</p>
<p>“The girls know it, but the boys sometimes need to learn it. I’m content to let either be my soldiers, but that requires <em>zeal</em>. Not everyone has it. Not everyone cleaves to their role and position. Everyone has responsibilities, and it takes a soldier to obey.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded again.</p>
<p>Her voice took on a different tone. No less ethereal, but haunting-ethereal, now. “The hair is to remind you that if you won’t be a soldier for the families, we’ll have you be a <em>slut</em>. We’ll get children out of you. If you fail at that, if they’re sickly or disobedient, we’ll geld you like we would any of the farm animals.”</p>
<p>Rain’s nod was stiff.</p>
<p>“You’re so distant. Have your aunt and uncle failed us? I’d thought your uncle was so dutiful.”</p>
<p>“They’ve done everything right,” Rain said, eyes on the corner of the rug on the floor.</p>
<p>“Your uncle beat you. You’re weak but you’re one of our blessed,” she said, speaking in his ear. “We could have him crippled or killed.”</p>
<p>“I asked him to, mama.”</p>
<p>“Even so,” she said.</p>
<p>“He is&mdash; he’s everything you want in a soldier,” Rain said, and his words were halting as he tried to defend a man he didn’t even love or like. “Hurting him to make a point or impart something onto me would hurt the Fallen more than it helped anything.”</p>
<p>“Allie then,” she said. Her voice was a whisper now. “Has she said things to you, to make you pull away?”</p>
<p>“Allie will be as dutiful a wife as my uncle is a soldier,” Rain said. His neck was so stiff his head shook slightly as he talked.</p>
<p>“Have you talked about it with her,” Mama Mathers said. She leaned over to put her face in front of Rain’s. He closed his eyes. “Leaving?”</p>
<p>“We both know you don’t ever leave,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Then where have you been, Rain?” she asked.</p>
<p>He couldn’t voice a response.</p>
<p>“Anyone who can’t answer my questions isn’t a soldier,” she said. “If I can’t get an answer when you’re right in front of me, I won’t breed you, either. We’ll take your mind and identity, or we’ll take your balls.”</p>
<p>“I’m weak,” Rain said. “I’ll be your soldier, but I need to figure that out first.”</p>
<p>“You’ve had a year.”</p>
<p>The words echoed Lee’s response to Love Lost.</p>
<p>“I’m going to kill the people who triggered alongside me. Hopefully, I can take their power.”</p>
<p>Her hand brushed his cheek.</p>
<p>“You have a time limit,” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded, stiff.</p>
<p>“I’ll be watching,” she said.</p>
<p>He nodded again.</p>
<p>There was only silence after that.</p>
<p>“May I go, mama?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Rain,” the voice came from the bed, even more ethereal and thin than it had been. He felt chills, hearing the voice. He felt the words worm into his head.</p>
<p>The bedsprings creaked as she stood, holding the pole to steady herself. He looked away. She only now stood from the bed.</p>
<p>“Rain,” she said. “Look at me.”</p>
<p>He resisted.</p>
<p>“I will have you killed if you do not,” she said.</p>
<p>He looked.</p>
<p>He’d only seen her leg and foot, and she’d jumped into his head, tactile, audible, present, impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>Now, seeing her in full, it was more pronounced, heavier, insofar as the frail woman could be ‘heavy’. Her hair was long, bleached silver, and frayed. Her face was thin enough that it appeared older.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>“Why would you leave, when we haven’t talked?” she asked. “You’ve been standing there, talking to yourself.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, mama,” he said.</p>
<p>He knew how she worked, but he couldn’t ignore the apparition in situations like this, because ignoring her and having her turn out to be real was the sort of thing that got him killed.</p>
<p>“Everything I said to you before now, it came from within you. I saw and heard much of it,” she said.</p>
<p>He hated seeing her, hated hearing her. He hated knowing it was for real.</p>
<p>“You should know these things to be absolute truth, divine and malign both,” she said. “The fears, the promise you made.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mama,” he said.</p>
<p>“Every time you think of me or mention me, I will be there. I will know where you are and see what you are doing. I will take stock and I will make my judgments. You <em>will</em> think of me, while saying your prayers on waking and on retiring, kneeling by your bed. Before each meal.”</p>
<p>He nodded, stiff.</p>
<p>“It’s been years,” she said. “You only think about me a few times a day. I thought it was time we were reacquainted. You have your mission.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kill my cluster.”</p>
<p>“And be a loyal soldier. Think of me,” she said. “If you don’t, you know what will happen.”</p>
<p>“Yes mama,” he said.</p>
<p>“Allie. Your aunt and uncle. Erin, her family. And you won’t see me. You’ll see other things.”</p>
<p>“Yes mama,” he said.</p>
<p>“Give me a kiss, now.”</p>
<p>She didn’t bend down, so he had to raise himself up to give her a peck on the cheek. He hated the contact, he hated how large she loomed in his vision, how that would give her more of a foothold.</p>
<p>He hated everything.</p>
<p>“Go, now, it’s late.”</p>
<p>He escaped the room, doorknob squeaking. In the process, he nearly collided with Elijah. It was only his own doing that stopped him.</p>
<p>Elijah held a bowl of water with a sponge floating in it in the crook of one arm. He had a slight smile on his face, barely visible through the long white-dyed hair he had. it was long enough to drape around his collarbone.</p>
<p>Behind that hair, his eyes were a milky cataract white. Not just for show. Seeing his cane was the only reason Rain hadn’t walked into him and spilled the water.</p>
<p>“Elijah. Escort Rain to the door, please. He seems unsteady on his feet.”</p>
<p>“Yes, mama,” Elijah said. He fumbled, and found a place to set the bowl down on a dresser.</p>
<p>Rain didn’t want the escort, but he didn’t want to refuse. Mama Mathers&mdash;</p>
<p>Rain flinched as she appeared, standing further down the hallway.</p>
<p>The figure made a small sound of amusement.</p>
<p>Elijah fumbled for his arm, then seized it tight.</p>
<p>The blind leading the sighted. Rain went, reaching out for the railing as soon as it was in reach, so he could have something to hold onto, and so he could keep Elijah from falling if it came down to it.</p>
<p>“Only the guilty are as upset as you seem to be,” Elijah said, his voice smooth, silky, and dangerous.</p>
<p>Rain didn’t reply, focusing instead on the stairs, trying not to think&mdash;</p>
<p>Mama Mathers appeared at the bottom of the flight.</p>
<p>He’d gotten so good at controlling his thinking, and it was all for nothing, now. Even thinking about not thinking about her was now enough. It might be for weeks or months.</p>
<p>“It’s hard, I know,” Elijah said. “I had a hard time with it for the first few years.”</p>
<p>They made it far enough down the stairs for Rain to see that the living room was empty, now, but for the meek women who acted as servants in the white cabin, cleaning up bottles and glasses,.</p>
<p>“I fixed it myself, after getting powers,” Elijah said. “Looked myself in the eye, mirror right in front of me, and I told myself to enjoy it. To like it, my own mother a mere thought away. To be loyal.”</p>
<p>When Rain heard the word ‘mother’, Mama Mathers appeared in the living room. They were fleeting images, each lasting for seconds, five or ten at a time. Her head would turn, and she would look around herself, or she would stare at him.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Rain said. He wasn’t sure why he’d said it. Dangerous words. “I’m sorry you had to go that far to find loyalty.”</p>
<p>Not better words, but he wasn’t thinking straight.</p>
<p>Elijah’s fingers dug into Rain’s arm.</p>
<p>“I can’t see anymore, Rain. My eyes have no power.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. They were at the door now. Elijah didn’t let him go.</p>
<p>“But what I say? My words have more power than before. All I have to do is tell you to, and you’d want it. I could tell you to be gleeful to have the worst punishment we can offer, and you would be, because it would be in service of the Fallen and Mama.”</p>
<p>Again, the image, standing outside, wearing her nightgown, hair blowing in the wind.</p>
<p>“Like I did for Lachlan,” Elijah said.</p>
<p>Rain nodded. “I know. But I don’t need that. I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“Whether you want it or not has nothing to do with it, Rain, and never did. Don’t disappoint mama.”</p>
<p>He let go of Rain’s arm. Rain stumbled on his way down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Be careful walking home,” Elijah said, his tone light. “It must be dark out.”</p>
<p>Rain pushed past the gate, passed Nell and Jay, who were still standing guard.</p>
<p>They started to approach him, and for the briefest moment, as he felt panic flare, his power appeared at his hands. They stopped, and Rain stumbled back more steps.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Rain Man,” Jay said. “I know it sucks.”</p>
<p>Nell sounded less sympathetic. “Don’t do anything reckless now. Never goes well.”</p>
<p>Rain shook his head, turned and jogged away, down the dark dirt road, with scarce lighting.</p>
<p>When he couldn’t see anyone or anything around, he leaned over the ditch and emptied his stomach’s contents. It tasted like all of the preservatives in the candies he’d taken, so he could stay awake and keep Erin company. That reminded him of Seir, of Tim, and that only made his stomach churn more.</p>
<p>Mama Mathers crossed his mind and was standing on the road above, watching him, as he straightened.</p>
<p>He staggered past her.</p>
<p>He couldn’t go home. Too far away.</p>
<p>His workshop. It wasn’t far. Dark, it required fumbling. He let himself in, made his way up the stairs, and collapsed to the floor as soon as he had it shut behind him.</p>
<p>The fact that the light was on was slow to register.</p>
<p>“Rain,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” he said. He didn’t want her to see him like this.</p>
<p>She knelt beside him. He shook his head.</p>
<p>She wasn’t strong enough to move him, but when he realized what she was doing, he didn’t have the willpower left to resist. She pulled him closer, so his head was in her lap.</p>
<p>She stroked his hair and shushed him.</p>
<p>Mama Mathers stood above the two of them, watching, and he couldn’t bring himself to mention it.</p>
<p>When the cluster dream whisked his consciousness away, it was a mercy.</p>

</div> <h1 id="chap44">Shadow &mdash; 5.1</h1><div class="entry-content">

<p>Experience told me that after waking up from a bad dream, it was better for me to move. The emotional and mental impact of being tired for the rest of the day was far lower than if I remained in bed and stewed. Either way, I rarely fell back into sleep.</p>
<p>It was one of the few things that had been easier at the hospital. Sleep had been regular, reliable. There hadn’t been any stretches where I’d have nightmares or insomnia for three nights in a row and the littlest things would be a grind by the third day. The drugs had been part of my diet, to ensure I fell asleep and woke up at certain times. They didn’t do much about the nightmares, but even waking up hadn’t ended the nightmare back then.</p>
<p>I was perpetually tempted to get something to help, but the degree to which I was tempted was a warning bell in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>Sleep, eating, having a space to retreat to, physical affection, attention, socializing, breathing. It was always the basic, animal things that came apart in the wake of stress and crisis. Things broke down, got twisted, or they were reminders.</p>
<p>I woke up and I pulled on a pair of jeans. Red-dyed raw denim, washed with something dark that made the creases and seams very apparent. They were a little looser fitting than my going-out jeans, and I’d settled into wearing them when I was at home and my dad was around, or now, when Crystal was around. It felt less like I was a slob if I was wearing them at home, especially if anyone dropped in.</p>
<p>Dean had tried on red jeans once, while I was shopping with him. His uncharacteristically self-conscious reaction had had me in stitches. If I hadn’t been able to fly, I would have been on the floor laughing. It was a good memory and a large part of why the jeans were a security-blanket level thing for me.</p>
<p>The memory had a nice second part, when Dean had mentioned that even the brief wearing of the jeans had turned his legs and underwear red. His best friends and I had been there as he’d recounted how concerned he’d been before realizing, and how the redness on his underwear had been worse where it pressed against the jeans, especially at the front. He’d described it as a clown-nose smudge on the front and his friends had been nearly falling out of their seats.</p>
<p>Even now, it put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>There were other memories too. Some from the same trip, others from other dates. He’d tried on a lot of jeans and to this day I could remember a pair where he had looked <em>perfect:</em> in profile, in the narrow waist and hips, the broad shoulders, the pert butt. He’d lifted up his shirt so I could see the fit, and I’d seen the thin trail of body hair leading up to his navel, his flat stomach, and the bones of his hips just above the jeans. Already warmed up by my laughing fit earlier, I’d worked myself up into a tizzy, the best words for it, and I’d maintained the tizzyness until twenty minutes later when we were cutting through the parking lot to the bus stop. I’d pulled him aside for a make out session.</p>
<p>I missed him so much it hurt, but the memories were happy ones and they were a good buffer against the bad night’s sleep. I kept my t-shirt and underwear on from yesterday and I went without a bra, pulling on a white sweater with too-long sleeves and a wide collar that left my shoulders bare.</p>
<p>The fit was snuggly and enveloping, as if the sweater itself was giving me a hug; kind of what I was shooting for when a not-insignificant part of me felt like I was five years old again, scared and wanting to crawl into bed with my mom and dad.</p>
<p>Set on putting the nightmare and the associated feelings behind me, I got some socks, underwear, sports bra, and a camisole top, stowing them in my bag where I already had my wallet. I pulled on some sneakers, sans socks, and headed to the balcony door. I eyed the clock in the kitchen as I passed it. Fifteen minutes to five.</p>
<p>I flew toward Cedar Point.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>“You’re not wrong,” Jessica Yamada said.</p>
<p>I stared out over the water. There was something sinister at play with the team.</p>
<p>Crystal was out at the water’s edge now, leaning over the railing. Forcefields made a kind of table or tray for her to set her food down on. It drew the attention of bystanders, in a ‘look at that, how cool’ way.</p>
<p>“Double agent? Someone under the influence of another?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Telling you would be telling you <em>who</em>,” Jessica said. “Which, unfortunately, would be betraying confidence.”</p>
<p>“Can I think aloud?”</p>
<p>“You can.”</p>
<p>“I got on this track of thought because I have an ominous feeling. I liken it to, uh, to my sister.”</p>
<p>“Keep in mind that hindsight might distort the picture with your sister. It’s easy to look back and think things were better or worse than they were.”</p>
<p>“I&mdash; yes,” I said, conceding the point. “Yes, but I can take key moments in isolation, scenes I remember with vivid detail, conversations down to the word, and I can use those as waypoints. I can recall what led up to what and what happened after, because I’ve replayed it all in my head a thousand times, and I can compare that to this.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lose sight of how replaying events in your head to such excruciating detail might distort the picture, as will gathering all of those like memories together.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try not to,” I said. “Thinking aloud… you think something’s up. You’re equipped with all of the facts, you know people’s stories, most of the secrets. Sveta said something about how she’s kind of unique in how she knows the most about most people, if I’m included in things.”</p>
<p>“I imagine she does.”</p>
<p>“I had no background going in, but I called you to talk because I had worries, and I’m realizing the general shape of your worries and why you brought me in. We’re at the same conclusion, but we got here by different roads. Something’s wrong or it’s going to go wrong.”</p>
<p>Jessica ate while I talked.</p>
<p>“You would be allowed to break confidentiality if there was a real and imminent risk of danger, or if there was a danger to a vulnerable group. And in the event of child abuse?”</p>
<p>“I would if I knew there was a danger to any involved,” Jessica said. “I would also have to disclose if required by law &mdash; a muddy thing these days, with the world hanging in suspension while the laws are being written.”</p>
<p>“I’ve run into that a bit,” I said, thinking of Natalie.</p>
<p>“And if I had to disclose to obtain payment or ensure proper care, as I would if I was giving care to someone who then had to go to the Asylum. In either of those two cases, for law or working with other mental health professionals, I would get the patient’s permission first.”</p>
<p>“So it’s not that, obviously. But you’re really worried. It’s something that you think is likely enough that you want me there to keep an eye on things.”</p>
<p>“I gave some serious consideration to whether the risk, though not a certain one, was worth the cost to the patient, to my career, and to the other patients I might no longer be able to look after.”</p>
<p>I looked at Jessica. She took another bite of her barbecue chicken sandwich, adjusting the wrapper to catch the drips of sauce and bits of lettuce and onion.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>
<p>With index finger and thumb still holding the sandwich, she held up some fingers to block her mouth while she chewed. I nodded, and waited for her to finish the mouthful.</p>
<p>She swallowed, paused, and then said, “I mean that if I were to report, there is a chance my reasons for reporting might be seen as insufficient, unproven, or unclear.”</p>
<p>“Just a suspicion. A strong one. Not enough reason to bring authorities into it or take action against the person or people you’re worried about.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>
<p>“What would happen?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. The future of the law is unclear. But I can say I would be tied up in proceedings as they judge whether I had merit, which could take months or even more than a year. Even if nothing happened, the fact that it even had to happen in the first place might impact who I could work for. I might have to take a leave from work, and I might not be able to work with the Wardens or with critical-risk, powered juveniles.”</p>
<p>“You’re kidding,” I said.</p>
<p>“The PRT was stringent about who they would hire and take into confidence, and there’s no reason to believe the next group to take power will be any less careful. Even with that in mind…”</p>
<p>She trailed off.</p>
<p>“You thought about telling people. That doesn’t seem… just. There are a lot of people that rely on you. Even with the group therapy kids, it’s pretty clear. I feel like if they didn’t have you, some pretty bad stuff would happen. And they’re, what, ten percent of your caseload? Less?”</p>
<p>“Less. But I can’t ignore one wrong involving my patients for the sake of ensuring I can maintain care for the rest. Thankfully, it isn’t that binary in reality. I can act clearly and decisively when there’s a clear and decisive danger. I can ask multiple someones that I know and respect to keep an eye out.”</p>
<p>“Me being one?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Victoria. You’re one of several. Some are waiting until the group is more visible, people in the Wardens will reach out and coordinate, they know where your group originated and that I’m concerned about where it may go.”</p>
<p>“I may not be the best choice&mdash; I know you didn’t choose me, exactly. You wanted me to try and steer the group away from the hero thing. I volunteered myself for this and you were…”</p>
<p>“Relieved to have one set of eyes on things, on a more ongoing basis.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“If you need to back away from this, you can,” she said. “Tell me and I’ll help. Others will help to keep an eye on things, if at more of a distance. I involved you initially and I was glad when you seemed to be interested and invested in a way that played to your strengths and that you enjoyed. I was, again, relieved to have more eyes on things. I do not, however, want you to suffer for it.”</p>
<p>I looked out over the water, which was so very dark and expansive. The city didn’t keep many lights on at night, with the power situation being what it was. Less lights to reflect down on the water after dark, less light reaching the clouds up above, to make the sky lighter.</p>
<p>Ink black darkness.</p>
<p>“How have you been?” she asked.</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>“Back at the Asylum, after you had worked on your motor control, I had you keep a journal, with the attendant’s help.”</p>
<p>Dark, heavy feelings, to match what I saw over the water.</p>
<p>“Each day in the calendar started with a drawn out cross, with a number written in each of the four quadrants. We tracked how you were doing in various areas.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t make much progress.”</p>
<p>“You moved on to the independent care facility.”</p>
<p>More dark, heavy feelings.</p>
<p>“How would you fill it out now? Physically, emotionally, contextually, and in the immediate picture with your personal needs.”</p>
<p>“I have no earthly idea,” I said.</p>
<p>“It might be worth paying attention to,” she said. “Have you called the number I gave you? The therapist?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“If you sat down with a friend or a loved one and they told you they felt as you have these past few days, their worries, wants, needs, and problems, would you want them to talk to someone qualified?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I guess I would.”</p>
<p>She took a bite of her sandwich, diplomatically avoiding saying something.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said. “I hear you.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I stopped in at the group’s headquarters, landing on the fire escape, and unlocking the door with my key.</p>
<p>Lights started to turn on, computer monitors appearing, Kenzie’s cube glowing at the corners, as her projected image appeared in the computer chair, fritzing.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Go back to sleep, Kenzie,” I said, to the room. “I woke up early and decided to go flying. I’m using the shower.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then the various projections, images, screens, and lights went dark, in the reverse order they had turned on.</p>
<p>I wondered if I’d actually woken her up, and if she’d actually heard me.</p>
<p>The apartment was fairly spacious, to the point it could have been a two-bedroom place if it actually had walls. As it was, the only walls encircled the corner, where a single shallow closet and the bathroom were. The bathroom, I couldn’t help but note, was ridiculously small for the size of the overall apartment. Toilet, sink, and shower stall, with barely any room to squeeze in between one thing and the thing or things beside it.</p>
<p>I stepped into the bathroom and disrobed, leaning out past the door to hang up my jeans outside, so the humidity of the shower wouldn’t get at them. I hung up the rest of my clothes on the inside of the door.</p>
<p>It was paranoia over preserving the raw denim and bringing out any dye that regular wearing hadn’t already worn away, maybe, but I’d spent a week’s pay on the jeans. If they had been free, I still would have been attached to them, because they reminded me of Dean, and because they were getting to be the most comfortable jeans I’d ever had, after rigorous wearing. I was going to be fussy.</p>
<p>I hadn’t gotten to be fussy with other things. A year after I had gone to the hospital, my mom had donated just about all of my clothes to charity.</p>
<p>There had been things I’d bought with Dean, with friends, with Aunt Sarah or Crystal. Uncle Neil had always spoiled me rotten, going to Crystal for tips on what to get me, and there had been four or five things I would have liked to have. Some had been milestone things, dresses I’d worn to school events, clothes I’d gotten to take home from photo shoots, and small accessories I’d bought as rewards to myself, like saving my first thousand and two thousand dollars, when I’d thought I might move to another city to follow Dean, if the PRT moved him.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been like she’d needed the room. Dad had moved out by then, I was gone, my sister was gone. It had been… her ripping off her own band-aid, by giving away my treasures.</p>
<p>I could have turned the shower to a scalding heat to try to find a physical way to reflect what I was feeling otherwise. I could have turned it to freezing cold, to wake myself up.</p>
<p>I opted for the embrace of warm water in lieu of the warm hug of the sweater I’d taken off. I got into the shower and used my flight, bringing my knees to my chest and hugging my legs tight, closing my eyes.</p>
<p>I rotated in the air a few times over the course of what might have been twenty minutes, letting the water pour over me. I didn’t open my eyes once for the duration, and I didn’t feel like I might fall asleep.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>I finished my recounting of my observations of the team. Jessica finished eating.</p>
<p>Rain was in a bad spot, and he’d revealed himself to be Fallen. Kenzie and Houndstooth. Ashley and her outbursts. Chris and his lopsided dips into one emotion. Sveta’s worries. Tristan and Moonsong.</p>
<p>“No team name, a lot of missing cape names. I know you don’t like the cape name thing&mdash;”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t like it,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I think it can make sense to take a hero name as an adult, but for someone younger, it can be one part of a greater issue. It’s hard enough for a teenager to decide who they are without the icon, the mask, and the name taking so much focus.”</p>
<p>I wanted to argue the point so badly, and I was too tired to do it. A passionate debate about powers, identities and costumes with Jessica, outside of the bounds of a therapy session? It would have been great.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be a war,” I said. “Rain is going to be swept up in it, if he hasn’t already. They’re hoping to kill him in the chaos. The others might be swept up in it.”</p>
<p>“We’ll try to keep that from happening.”</p>
<p>“If it happens, we can try to make sure it happens in the safest, most controlled way possible,” I said. I saw the look on her face, and hurried to add, “I know you want to keep it from happening, but they want to protect each other, and they do want to stretch their wings and flex their powers. It’s part of being a cape.”</p>
<p>“It is,” Jessica said. “What about you?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Will you be swept up in it? Do you want to stretch your wings and flex your powers?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to flex my powers,” I said. “I do want to be involved. I… see this as a snowball rolling downhill. It’s chaotic and it has the potential to do a lot of damage, some of it inevitable. But for all their flaws, I think they are holding onto what you wanted to impart on them, for the most part they need… nudges.”</p>
<p>“Nudges?”</p>
<p>“To change the course of the snowball. Reassuring Sveta. Redirecting Ashley or giving her an excuse to do what she wants to do anyway. Keeping Kenzie from overcommitting herself. Tristan gets into things and needs a bit of a shake, and he’ll step back from the headlong charge. Rain&mdash; more complicated, because it’s not <em>him</em>, exactly. Self doubt, but it’s external factors pushing in on him that we need to worry about.”</p>
<p>“And Chris?”</p>
<p>“I don’t even know. I plan to keep a close eye on him, because I haven’t figured him out and he doesn’t seem like he wants to share any of himself, which makes me worry. I’ll see if I can figure out what to do.”</p>
<p>“Nudges and keeping an eye on things,” Mrs. Yamada said. “I think you’re on the right track. Step back if this is wearing on you.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “<em>Everything</em> wears on me. Eating and sleeping wear on me. Stepping back wouldn’t do me any good. I’ll call your colleague. Do what I can.”</p>
<p>“Self care,” Jessica said. “Yes. Be kind to yourself, reach out for help if you need it. You have friends. Don’t lose sight of that.”</p>
<p>I looked over in Crystal’s direction. She waved the foil-wrapped sandwich in the air, as if baiting me. I found myself tempted, when I hadn’t even been hungry before. “Yeah. I just realized how ravenous I am. I feel like there are a hundred more things I should tell you that you need to know, but…”</p>
<p>“Not enough minutes in the day, even if and when I get more with a helpful someone’s power. I know. Go eat.”</p>
<p>I stepped back from the railing. “Sorry, I skipped breakfast and I tossed my lunch.”</p>
<p>“I’d have stern words for you, but I barely ate today either. Take care of yourself, Victoria.”</p>
<p>She hugged me.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk again soon,” she said, without breaking the hug.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>I hadn’t worked out what I was doing in regard to Rain. A part of me had hoped for guidance. In the end, it had been better to give Mrs. Yamada the lay of the land. If she <em>was</em> suspicious, then my mention of outbursts, of backsliding, of stubbornness, confrontations or secrecy might have been the cue she needed to make a decision.</p>
<p>If she was okay with where things stood, then so was I. I would nudge, I would keep an eye out, and I would look after myself. I felt more peace than I had, having had the conversation.</p>
<p>“Bye,” I said, my voice not all there because I was a little choked up. I couldn’t wholly pin down why.</p>
<p>I broke the hug and went straight to my steaming barbecue chicken sandwich. Crystal too.</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>Shower off. Tangled mane transformed to wet combed locks, wet locks transformed to damp braid. Clothes on: sports bra on under sweater, sleeves rolled up around the wrists, red raw jeans, socks and sneakers. The clothes I’d hung up on the bathroom door had been effectively steamed while I was in the shower, and my hands smoothed out the wrinkles that had accumulated from my clothes being in my bag.</p>
<p>Self care, to have a shower with no disturbances or worries about bothering Crystal. To dress in things that felt <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The computers illuminated as I walked through the main room.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep,” I said. The computers went dark.</p>
<p>I had to fish through three coarse paper bags of groceries that we’d stowed under one of the tables to find the food supplies. A small bag of lime and chili chips, a protein bar, some preservatives with pepperoni stick added in, more stick-shaped preservative packs with cheese in the mix, dried fruit, two bottles of vitamin water, and a large thermos of regular tap water</p>
<p>Breakfast.</p>
<p>Laptop. I flipped it open and turned it on. The agenda for the day was laid out in glowing words against a dark background. More groups would walk through.</p>
<p>I had messages from the night prior. Fume Hood. Another friend and support. Hero teams planning to patrol in Cedar Point. Other, related things. There was a vein of positivity running through it all. The hero teams reaching out, expressing interest, wondering about the response they’d gotten, or expressing curiosity about villains who’d showed their faces but hadn’t been involved. Who was that guy? What’s her history?</p>
<p>It was easy to be standoffish, to draw lines in the sand when it came to jurisdictions, to make territorial noises and see the other teams as competition.</p>
<p>This was a balancing act, but there were benefits. The heroes we were connecting with knew some of our names, faces, and voices.</p>
<p>The clock told me it was a quarter after six in the morning as I left the headquarters.</p>
<p>My feet left the fire escape and touched down in Cedar Point a few minutes later. The shifting temperature and the proximity of the water cast Cedar Point in a heavy mist. There weren’t many lights on, but the ones that were on made the surrounding mist glow.</p>
<p>Not many people awake.</p>
<p>I walked along the rooftops, flying up to the points higher than I could get with a skip or a jump. Briefly, I turned on my forcefield.</p>
<p>Briefly, I saw the mist stir, as facial features and hands moved through it. If I hadn’t known what I was looking at, I wouldn’t have been able to make much sense of the swirl here, the vaguely oval void there.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a good feeling, to verify that, but I’d treated my heart gently this morning, armoring it in sentiment. I could take that much.</p>
<p>I sat on the edge of a random rooftop, got my laptop out, and opened it.</p>
<p>There wasn’t internet here, but I had files saved on my computer. Random pictures I’d saved, old PRT documents I’d scanned and saved for printing for my collection, that I hadn’t gotten around to deleting or printing, and some things I’d typed up for the Patrol block.</p>
<p>One leg folded under me, the other dangling off the edge of the roof, I poised the laptop on my knee and dug for what I could find on costumes and branding. I created seven folders, one for myself and one for each of the six members of the team, and began copying files over to each, where relevant.</p>
<p>The pepperoni sticks were stale, brittle and tough enough I had to gnaw on them to soften them enough to bite through. Tasty, though.</p>
<p>A small truck beeped with surprising loudness as it backed into an alley. One person got out to guide it, waving and gesturing, as the headlights of the truck illuminated him in the fog.</p>
<p>The truck fully backed in, he turned around. Pausing, he looked up at me on the rooftop. He raised an arm.</p>
<p>I packed up my laptop and hopped off the roof. I landed silently behind him. He wore a jacket with a lime green reflective vest over it, and the combination made him look much bulkier than he was.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who knocked Moose on his ass,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Just… hanging around with your computer?”</p>
<p>I shifted my bag at my shoulder.</p>
<p>“I saw the glow of the screen,” he said.</p>
<p>“Felt like I should make a stake. It’s easy to show up during the daylight hours, but it means something else if I could be here at midnight or at six in the morning. It’s interesting that it seems like the people who keep watch haven’t responded to me yet.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” he asked. “Huh.”</p>
<p>“What’s in the truck?”</p>
<p>“Produce,” he said. “It’s not a good haul. My buddy back at the depot picked up a box of melons, it was liquid. Sloshed himself in watermelon juice, shoulder to toe. <em>Long</em> day of work ahead of him.”</p>
<p>“Just shipping it out, leaving it to the stores to complain?”</p>
<p>“I guess they hope enough people won’t bother that it balances out.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” he asked. He extended an arm.</p>
<p>I drew in a deep breath.</p>
<p>“About Cedar Point,” he clarified.</p>
<p>“I think this place is going to get wrapped up in a war,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” he asked. “Because of the heroes coming through?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s building up to <em>something</em>, whatever the people in charge seem to want,” I said. “The war is going to start here or it’s going to come here.”</p>
<p>“Should my buddy and I get out?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You might want to,” I said.</p>
<p>“We pay a fee to do business here, our manager covers that, but we have to face down the people in costume who collect the fee and give us a hard time, too. Boss can’t handle that. Stuff off the boats and trains hasn’t been as good lately, profit margins are getting slimmer. Maybe we’ll try telling the manager it’s not worth it.”</p>
<p>“Is it a problem? The heroes being here?”</p>
<p>He had to think about it.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I responded.</p>
<p>“But it’s a necessary one,” he added.</p>
<p>It meant a lot to me, to hear that. I held myself to the idea that if I couldn’t trust the law, I could trust what was right. If I couldn’t trust either, I could reach out.</p>
<p>I couldn’t trust the law. It was in flux. Natalie was trying to predict it, but it was more question mark than full stop. As for what was right, I wasn’t sure I could trust myself, and I couldn’t trust the team. Jessica could give me some direction, tell me that I was all clear if I kept an eye out, to nudge. The other teams could validate and suggest they liked this direction. Collaboration, at least, felt right.</p>
<p>Reaching out, I could get some affirmation from this nameless guy in a reflective green vest.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said.</p>
<p>“You said war,” he said. “Not a battle?”</p>
<p>“I think it matters more,” I said. “There are other places. They’ll follow suit. The entire city might change course, depending on what happens.”</p>
<p>“Huh. I’m Jerry, by the way,” he introduced himself. He pulled off a glove to extend his hand my way.</p>
<p>“Victoria.”</p>
<p>“No hero name?”</p>
<p>“No hero costume,” I said. “Yet.”</p>
<p>“Can I give you a nod or a wave if I see you, while you’re hanging around, then?”</p>
<p>“Better not. When the villains are awake, they’ll be keeping an eye on things. With powers.”</p>
<p>“No shit?”</p>
<p>“On <em>everything</em>,” I said.</p>
<p>“I might talk to my boss, then,” he said. “Sounding more like I should stay clear.”</p>
<p>“Good,” I said.</p>
<p>“And you’ll be here, then? Staking a claim? Preparing for war?”</p>
<p>“Making sure that if nothing else, instead of it being fifty villains and no heroes, it’s fifty villains and one hero. It’s me being ridiculous, but I feel like that’s important.”</p>
<p>“Lonely,” he said.</p>
<p>“Nah,” I said. “I think I’ll have allies when it counts.”</p>
<p>⊙</p>
<p>The entire group arrived pretty much all together. Tristan, Ashley, Sveta, Chris, and Kenzie. The westbound train arrived at twelve-thirty, and the eastbound train was just shy of ten minutes later. Delays and other passing trains changed things up, but it seemed if the group wanted to meet at the station and walk together, they could.</p>
<p>“Here already,” Ashley observed.</p>
<p>“Yep,” I said. I held up a hand as Kenzie walked past, and she gave me a high-five.</p>
<p>“Cool jeans,” she said, without turning.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said. She went straight to her desk, kicking the cube that sat on the ground by her chair to boot it up before falling back into her chair and hitting the lever to boost herself up.</p>
<p>“Did you see the emails from the other teams?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“No,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you in a moment. You’ll like it,” Tristan said. “They were talking some and they like this. Cedar Point was a thing that was bothering a lot of people, I think.”</p>
<p>“Civilians too, maybe,” I said. “I dropped in early enough the villains weren’t really awake. Talked to a few. Feelings on heroic intervention range from positive to mixed. Considering that feelings on heroes are mixed in the first place…”</p>
<p>“We were talking, thinking I’d pay a visit,” Chris said. “Keep them on their toes.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather wait,” I said. “Rain said his trigger group would be out of commission for a few days while repairing and healing from injuries. It’s been a few days. They were hiring people, and they probably won’t wait <em>too</em> long before they use those hires, or else those people might get caught up in other activities.”</p>
<p>“I’m primed to do <em>something</em>, and I think you guys would rather I do it there than in here,” Chris said. “We’ve got&mdash; what, two teams coming through today?”</p>
<p>“Two with a third holding back. Third one is a single cape, they want to actually do something,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“We need to discuss that one,” I said.</p>
<p>“They’re paying,” he said. “If we give him clear directions on how to ruin a villain’s day, he’ll pay us two hundred bucks. It’s a good precedent.”</p>
<p>“People are coming through,” Chris said. “If we need it, I’ll be a distraction. I’m quick, I’ll be in and out.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Tristan said. He looked at me and Ashley.</p>
<p>“It was the original plan,” Ashley said. “I say let him.”</p>
<p>I made a so-so gesture.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Tristan said. “We’ll debate it when the time comes. It’s anxiety?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Mad Anxiety.”</p>
<p>“Great,” Tristan said. “It’s not the screaming one, is it?”</p>
<p>“Mad is the screaming one,” Chris said. “I wanted to make an impact and if we need me as a distraction then screaming is good.”</p>
<p>Tristan said something Spanish under his breath and went to his whiteboard. Swear words, if I had to guess.</p>
<p>“I’ll go in,” Ashley said. “We said I would after a few days, and if things are happening, I want to already be recognizable around there. Will the eye camera be ready?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kenzie said. “Oh, Victoria, I bought some energy drinks if you want them. And I have a thermos of a coffee my dad and mom really like.”</p>
<p>“What coffee?” Sveta asked. “Weld and I were trying to find one he might like, but it turned out he wants it super bitter, because that’s the only way he can taste it. We had a bunch of things of coffee taking up space, and I took it on myself to drink it. I even gave some away.”</p>
<p>“You should bring it in,” Tristan said. “Supply the team.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it didn’t occur to me. Except I can, because I don’t think about what I have in the cupboards unless I’m standing in front of an open cupboard. I have other stuff.”</p>
<p>“How far has this food experiment with Weld gone?” I asked.</p>
<p>So it went, the conversation sprawling, back and forth, casual, from work to life.</p>
<p>I’d woken up before dawn, taken the necessary time to pull myself together, and then tentatively reached out, to make sure I wasn’t just centered in my own self, but in what I was doing. Reaching out to make sure it seemed right and, to a slightly lesser extent, that it was within the bounds of the law. Reaching out, too, to have more contacts.</p>
<p>I had a bad feeling. No, more than that, I had bad <em>feelings.</em> About the team, what lay beneath the surface, the war over Cedar Point, the Fallen, the clash between Snag’s group and the Fallen, and the danger to Rain.</p>
<p>But I knew why I was here. A potential disaster lurked here. Knowing that made everything easier, in an ironic way. The dissonance of not feeling <em>right</em> about being here had eased.</p>
<p>There were clear, defined, acceptable enemies to face down.</p>
<p>“I don’t want a wig,” Ashley said, to Sveta.</p>
<p>“I’m saying, if you cut your hair&mdash;”</p>
<p>“If.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s an option. It could even give you a secret identity. Kenzie, the eye thing you were talking about, you can give Ashley eyes with irises, right?”</p>
<p>“I could.”</p>
<p>“Eye color, hair color, clothes,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Wigs get pulled off or lost in a fight,” Ashley said. “It’s undignified.”</p>
<p>“You do realize I’m wearing a wig.”</p>
<p>“I realize you’re wearing a wig and you have the capacity to pound someone’s face in or dangle them off the side of a building. They’ll learn to respect you if you make them,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“You do realize we’re supposed to be heroes, right?” Chris said. “Nominally?”</p>
<p>“Not nominally,” I said.</p>
<p>“What’s nominally?” Kenzie asked. “How do you spell it? I’ll ask the computer.”</p>
<p>“And I’m not about to do any of those things,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Ashley ignored us. “Me? I can kick them, or I can turn them into a bloody smear using my power. That’s pretty much it. I don’t have the manual dexterity or hand strength to use a weapon, I can’t punch them without damaging my hands. Kicks won’t do enough, using my power does too much, and the mess would be inconvenient. I don’t want a wig.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want a wig. Fine,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“I have some images on my computer,” I said. “Hair and eye makeup, some costume related.”</p>
<p>“Show me?” Ashley asked.</p>
<p>We walked over to where my computer was on a table. I found the folder and opened it.</p>
<p>Sveta leaned over me, half-hugging me from behind as I clicked through the images.</p>
<p>“I was thinking of a name to do with swans,” Ashley said, as I clicked.</p>
<p>“An awful lot of the bird names are taken,” I said. “It was a trend once. What were you considering?”</p>
<p>“Swansong,” she said. “If I go with the white costume.”</p>
<p>“I can check, but I’d have to go through my paper stuff,” I said.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that kind of a bad omen of a name?” Sveta asked “Like, last dance or ‘I’m going to retire today’?”</p>
<p>“I like bad omens,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“I like this one,” I said, indicating an image. “I have a folder for you too, Sveta, just so you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious what you’re thinking.”</p>
<p>“All over the place,” I said. “Lots of stuff where I might not even remember why I saved the image in your folder.”</p>
<p>“Guys,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>He had our attention. His phone was to his ear.</p>
<p>“Rain’s nearby. He wants to know if he can bring Erin.”</p>
<p>Just like that, the mood of the room shifted.</p>
<p>We exchanged looks, and there were tentative nods, some real nods, no vetoes or refusals.</p>
<p>Tristan gave the a-ok. He hung up.</p>
<p>The silence lingered for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“I like Erin,” Kenzie said. “And I’m really glad Rain’s coming back so soon.”</p>
<p>“Yesterday was hard on him,” Tristan said. “And… <em>Coño,</em> it was his night last night.”</p>
<p>“His night?” I asked.</p>
<p>“His dream,” Tristan said. “It’s always hard.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a good dream to me,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Tristan picked up an eraser from by the nearest whiteboard and threw it at Chris.</p>
<p>“I like this one,” Ashley said. She tapped the frame of the laptop screen.</p>
<p>“Elaborate,” Sveta said. “You’d have to draw it on every time you went out in costume.”</p>
<p>“It could be projected,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“It could,” I said. “If it’s easy to do, we could do that. I think the thing to do would be to make sure you look good if the projector breaks or loses power, and then build on that.”</p>
<p>“Like the wig idea,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>Ashley sighed.</p>
<p>Rain opened the side door of the headquarters, letting Erin in first before following.</p>
<p>I’d gathered myself together earlier in the day. For the first time since the Patrol block job, I felt like I almost had my feet under me.</p>
<p>Tristan had said Rain had dealt with a hard night on top of a hard yesterday. It showed. Something hollowed out, something wounded. He looked like I’d felt after Snag had gotten his hands on me.</p>
<p>When he approached the table next to his whiteboards, Erin stepped back a little to let him pass. It was a subtle thing that I couldn’t help but notice, but it played into the second half of my observation of him. That he seemed more dangerous. Where I felt stronger because I’d pulled myself together some and clarified my direction with Mrs. Yamada, Rain conveyed something <em>more</em> in how he’d come undone.</p>
<p>Even yesterday, his face swollen on the one side, black eye, cuts and scabs, it had seemed that idea had held true as he’d found the strength to reveal his background.</p>
<p>What had he dreamed, last night, that this was what had come to the surface? Was this the strength of desperation? Something else?</p>
<p>Rain greeted Tristan first, almost falling forward in a ‘bro’ half-hug with just the one arm, the pat on the shoulder.</p>
<p>He gave a nod to Ashley as she was closest to him as he rounded the table. Sveta gave him a pat on the shoulder, a smile, and a few murmured words that got Rain to nod a little, his expression relaxing a little in what might have been a smile for someone else. She left us to go talk to Tristan.</p>
<p>Rain stopped a distance away from me. He didn’t quite face me, and instead said, “We good, Kenz?”</p>
<p>“Yup. I’m glad you came. And you brought Erin. You want to see my toys, Erin?”</p>
<p>Erin walked from the side door to Kenzie, but ninety-five percent of her attention was on Rain and me. I hadn’t quite seen her like this.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen Rain like this. He almost swayed where he stood, eyebrows slightly furrowed, clearly in deep thought.</p>
<p>I didn’t like the Fallen. They scared the shit out of me. I hated everything they represented. He’d killed people, <em>children</em>, and it didn’t seem right that he was standing here and that was passing without incident.</p>
<p>Maybe his condition, mental and physical, represented just how hard he was fighting to get free. Maybe it suggested it wasn’t passing without incident.</p>
<p>I put out my hand. When he went to shake it, I grabbed him by the wrist, instead.</p>
<p>He flinched at the unexpected gesture, looked to one side, and stared off into space momentarily. There was a part of me that recognized that too. Bad dreams.</p>
<p>He forced his attention back to us and our exchange, looked down at our hands. He took my wrist. A clasp, more than a shake.</p>
<p>“We good?” he asked, not making eye contact. His voice was faintly rough-edged, like he’d screamed himself hoarse. As if a small part of Snag had found root in Rain’s throat.</p>
<p>“We’re good,” I said.</p>
<p>“Let’s get ourselves organized,” Tristan said. “Training wheels are off, and we’ve got a few things going on today. Ashley’s going back in, and it makes sense to insert her before things get messy. Two hero teams are swinging through sometime after that, we’ve got Chris on standby and one hero who wants to pay us to get a chance to do something, which we’ll want to discuss.”</p>
<p>“There’s Prancer to account for too,” I said, releasing Rain’s wrist, approaching, “He’s had a day to think about what we’re doing and a day to get countermeasures in place. He reassured his friends that he had a handle on this. Let’s prove him wrong.”</p>

<p>“Maybe trouble,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>I was digging through my bag when she said it. I set some of my things aside and headed to the front of the room. Erin was standing beside Kenzie, while Kenzie regaled her with stuff.</p>
<p>Rain was thirty feet away, sitting in his computer chair in his nook. Some of the tables we’d arranged were situated so the long side was against the wall, but in the interest of giving Rain some desk space, we’d set up two so the shorter ends of the table were against the wall and the tables jutted out into the room, his whiteboards against the wall between the tables. He’d unfurled a roll of paper tablecloth, laid out his arms on it, and was using marker to draw on the tablecloth and make references.</p>
<p>His bag was open, and I could see the jaws of a bear trap and a bit of chain within.</p>
<p>He looked up, met my eyes, then looked at the screen. He remained where he was. He, Sveta and I were the ones who hung back a bit. Him because of his work, and Sveta and I because we were rummaging in our bags.</p>
<p>“Continuation of a bit of family drama,” Kenzie said. She hit a few keys. The camera’s image on the screen focused in on one section and rotated.</p>
<p>Nailbiter and a teenaged girl were standing outside of the nail place where Ashley had been comparing her nails to the outdated example images in the window. A middle-aged woman with bleached blonde hair was holding the teenager’s wrist. The angle didn’t allow for a very good view of Nailbiter or her expression. She didn’t seem to be doing anything to step in.</p>
<p>The teenager had a resemblance to her mother, but was slender. Her hair reminded me of how Byron wore his, it was the same medium-long length, slicked straight back from the face, but the teenager’s was bleached where Byron’s was black. In facial features and in expression, the teenager was a younger mirror of her mom. Neither was happy with the other.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” I asked. “What’s the drama?”</p>
<p>“The girl is Colt. She was working for her parents, but business was slow, they weren’t paying her, and now she’s working for Nailbiter.”</p>
<p>“Working how?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Muscle, I guess?” Kenzie asked.</p>
<p>“She can’t weigh more than a hundred and thirty pounds,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, she’s hanging out with Nailbiter and she’s getting paid, I think, because she’s had new clothes lately,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“You’ve been watching her?” I asked. “How do you know all of this?”</p>
<p>“I’m not <em>watching her</em> watching her. That makes it sound like I’m being creepy spying on people. Geez. It’s because they keep having shouting matches at night, and idle cameras go on alert mode at loud noises, so I end up hearing stuff.”</p>
<p>“So you’re being creepy <em>eavesdropping</em> on people,” Chris said.</p>
<p>Kenzie glanced around her desk. “I’d throw something at you if I could find something I’m okay breaking.”</p>
<p>“Family issue, okay, but what’s going on <em>now</em>?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“And do we need to step in?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Kenzie said. “Colt left the place to go talk to Nailbiter on the street, and they started to leave when Colt’s mom, Tammy, went after her and stopped her. Her sister, who’s about my age, she went outside with Tammy the mom and ran back inside.”</p>
<p>“Audio?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>Kenzie hit a key.</p>
<p>Chris asked, “Who names their kid <em>Colt</em>? Or is that a shitty nickname?” Chris’s second question had him inadvertently talk over the start of the audio feed. Kenzie shushed him.</p>
<p>“…cking let me go!”</p>
<p>“Get inside! You’re still in trouble for stealing!”</p>
<p>“Fuck you! I deserved something!”</p>
<p>“She’s been helping, you haven’t!”</p>
<p>“The one time she helps, you decide to pay her, and I get fuck all because it’s the one time I decided to go out instead!? Fuck that, fuck you!”</p>
<p>“Is this how we’re doing this!?” the mom screamed at Nailbiter, ignoring her daughter for the moment. “You want money from us while you’re scaring away the business, and now you’re taking my little girl, too!?”</p>
<p>“I’m not fucking <em>little</em>!”</p>
<p>“She decides,” Nailbiter’s voice had a slight whistle around the words. “I’m losing patience, Colt. If I walk away from here without you, I’m not bringing you along again.”</p>
<p>“I decide, not her!” the mother raised her voice. “I’m the mother!”</p>
<p>“Then the two of you need to decide,” Nailbiter said. “Now.”</p>
<p>Colt hauled back, her arm still in the firm grip of her mother’s two hands.</p>
<p>I looked at the door. If I flew over now&mdash;</p>
<p>A sound of an impact made me look back to the screen. Colt’s mother had turned away. Colt had her free hand raised. She’d slapped her mother.</p>
<p>Her mother moved to retaliate, and Colt pulled back out of the way. There wasn’t much heart behind the swing, either. Not for the mom. The teenager tugged to try to free her arm, and when she couldn’t, she swung again. Not a slap this time, but a punch.</p>
<p>Kenzie looked away before the second punch could land. She didn’t look back for the third or fourth.</p>
<p>“Shitty name girl’s got <em>grit</em>,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “I don’t think that’s grit.”</p>
<p>“Colt!” the father hollered the word, on emerging from the nail salon. Colt backed away, arm free of her mother’s grip, while the father advanced.</p>
<p>Nailbiter stepped forward and to the side, to put herself between Colt and her father. The father stopped in his tracks. He looked at his wife, then leaned over for a closer look, touching her cheek where it already looked like it was going to be a heck of a bruise.</p>
<p>He and his wife stood together as they squared off against Nailbiter.</p>
<p>“She’s mine, now,” Nailbiter said.</p>
<p>“Are you, Colt?” the father asked. He got angrier as he talked, “Are you <em>hers</em>? You’d hit your mother, who sacrificed so much for you?”</p>
<p>Colt looked spooked, in that moment. Kenzie zoomed the camera in further, moving the mouse.</p>
<p>It was Erin who said something. “Say no.”</p>
<p>“Fine. I’m hers,” Colt said. “Fuck this. At least she pays me.”</p>
<p>“Brave sounding words, while you’re standing behind her. You’re not going to stand aside, let us handle this as a family?”</p>
<p>“No,” Nailbiter said. “She’s an employee.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want trouble,” the father said. “We can leave it at this.”</p>
<p>“If you want,” Nailbiter said.</p>
<p>“Good,” Colt said. “Leave it and fuck off.”</p>
<p>“Don’t come home,” the father said, and his voice was hard, now. “Don’t show your face in front of me, your mother, or Reese again. Be her errand girl. I’m done trying with you.”</p>
<p>Colt was silent.</p>
<p>“Patience lost,” Nailbiter said, the dry whistle catching on the ‘s’ of Lost. “I’m going.”</p>
<p>“Mom?” Colt asked. I heard her ask that, and I wondered if she wanted her mother to grab her, to drag her away.</p>
<p>“What are you asking me for?” Tammy asked, one hand at the side of her face. “If you’re going to go, then go.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Colt asked. She spat the words, “<em>Fuck you.</em>”</p>
<p>“I’ll be by next week to collect,” Nailbiter said. “See you then.”</p>
<p>Another whistle on the ‘s’ of ‘see.’ Nailbiter and Colt walked away. The father hugged his wife.</p>
<p>“Is this kidnapping?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “We could call authorities, but I have a hard time believing we’ll be able to get cops out there, and have them take action with a nearly-18 person who doesn’t want to cooperate or go back home.”</p>
<p>“Having the police show up to take her away might make her dig her heels in more,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Stupid,” Erin said. “So fucking stupid. Colt and her parents both.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were a touch moist as she shook her head, arms crossed, and ducked past Sveta and I.</p>
<p>“Too close to home?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“I can’t talk about home. Sorry. Give me a second.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Sveta said. She met my eyes.</p>
<p>I had worries, but they were ones I’d rather not voice aloud. Nailbiter had a history that had seen her arrested and sentenced harshly, without much delay. Post-Gold Morning, she’d settled back into her role as a violent cape, serving as what might have been Beast of Burden’s second in command.</p>
<p>She was calmer than she’d been reported to be in the one article I’d been able to dig out of my boxes of notes, part of an article from a magazine, listing the Birdcage’s residents at the time. The last page of the article, annoyingly, hadn’t been preserved. I’d pulled the page out for whatever article or image was on the other side.</p>
<p>Either way, violent, as might have been expected for an ex-con with rusty nails instead of teeth. Prison and nine years might have changed her a bit from the person described in the article, but I doubted Colt was in good hands.</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said. “We don’t want to ignore this. I’ll make some calls later. I’ll see what I can find on Nailbiter. She was from North Carolina, I think, and some of their capes are still around. I’d have to track down a veteran. We’ll see what we’re up against. If I get a chance, I’ll have a conversation with her.”</p>
<p>“And say what?” Chris asked. “Parents don’t want her, intense nails-for-teeth lady does.”</p>
<p>“She didn’t want to go, and I think her parents wanted her to stay,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“‘I never want to see your face again’ sounds like a real term of endearment,” Chris said.</p>
<p>“<em>If</em> she’s with Nailbiter,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll talk with her,” I said. I looked at Ashley. “Given the crowd you’re likely to run into while you’re over there, there’s a chance you may see her.”</p>
<p>“She hit her mom, several times,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said.</p>
<p>“Her mom was willing to hit her back. Colt learned that behavior from someone.”</p>
<p>“You’re assuming she picked that up from her parents? That’s a bit of a leap. We can’t know for sure,” I said.</p>
<p>“We can guess,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“But we can’t <em>know</em>,” I said. “It’s… far from great, that situation, Colt, her parents. Maybe think about what you might say or do if you run into her.”</p>
<p>Ashley shook her head slightly.</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking more about Nailbiter,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>“Okay, you should already know she’s dangerous,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m more dangerous, I’m not worried. I want to go. Sooner than later.”</p>
<p>“Do you still want to do the eye thing?” Sveta asked.</p>
<p>“If possible. I’ll take my mask off when I’m with others.”</p>
<p>Sveta turned to me. “Did you find anything usable?”</p>
<p>“Mascara.”</p>
<p>“I have stuff, plus the white cover-up. Erin? Do you have anything?”</p>
<p>“I have stuff,” Erin said. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>It was a series of last-minute tasks, Sveta, Erin and I helping do up Ashley so she could present a good face. Kenzie was high-energy, switching from watching to fiddling with the yet-to-be inserted eye camera to talking to Chris about what he was doing when he went out.</p>
<p>“Any word on Snag’s group?” Rain asked. Ashley was in a chair with her back to the table Rain was using for work on his hands.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen Snag and Love Lost around,” Kenzie said. “Love Lost more than Snag. She was in a bad mood yesterday. She went away for a while.”</p>
<p>“Snag is tinkering, and if Victoria’s description of how he operates was any clue, he can tap into his other powers through his tech,” Rain said. He slapped something metal down on the table, hard. “And I’m struggling with something that should be simple.”</p>
<p>“I want to talk to you about tinker stuff after,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I had some small arms for you to mess with, but they got broken,” Rain said. “I have the contact pads.”</p>
<p>“Awesome,” Kenzie said. “I think we can figure something out.”</p>
<p>Ashley was patient as we applied some white and black eyeliner, then used Sveta’s cover-up to fix the color around the eyes.</p>
<p>“I wish I could do this,” Sveta said. She was handling the holding of the various brushes and objects, so we could hand one to her and take another. “But my hands can’t hold the brushes and pencils, and I wouldn’t feel safe with my tendrils out so close to Ashley’s face.”</p>
<p>“Tendrils,” Erin said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what Rain told you, but I’d probably accidentally rip out Ashley’s eye.”</p>
<p>“If they do a bad job, we can wash it off and you can try,” Ashley said. “If you rip out my eye, then I’ll have the intimidation effect I want. Of a different sort.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Sveta said, with an unusually sarcastic tone. “You’re fine with losing an eye, that’s badass. But you can’t wear a wig, because if it was knocked off, <em>that</em> would be embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Ashley sighed. I nearly stabbed her in the nose with the eyeliner pencil.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” I told her.</p>
<p>I finished with the eyeliner, and stepped back to admire the work. A white line along the lower lid, to make the eyes appear larger, and black mascara, because her eyelashes were apparently white without. Erin had handled the careful application of fine veins of black eyeliner that fanned out from the eyes in parallel with the eyelashes. They had been drawn in waves with each wave washed out with pats of the white cover-up, so the lines appeared to fade out and have dimension. At each corner of each eye, I’d drawn a hooked triangle, with the hook pointing down at the inner corners and up at the outer ones.</p>
<p>Erin had a bit of the softer, artistic touch for the lines and fading-out, I had the steadier hand for the line work.</p>
<p>The only mirror was a compact mirror, too small to show everything, so I took a picture instead. I showed Ashley.</p>
<p>“Good,” she said. She smiled.</p>
<p>“Stay put,” Kenzie said. “Eye camera. Here we go, and I can’t touch your face because I don’t want to smudge the nice makeup.”</p>
<p>“Camera first next time, then,” Ashley said.</p>
<p>Erin clearly had the heebie jeebies, as Kenzie held the needle within a few inches of Ashley’s eye, swinging it within half of an inch of the eye as she rotated one part to get it tighter.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Kenzie said. “Here we go. Same as before, but don’t flinch and keep your eye fixed on one point. Making contact on three, ready?”</p>
<p>“Ready.”</p>
<p>“Zero, one, two, thre&mdash; wait.”</p>
<p>Ashley stayed stock still, waiting.</p>
<p>“Haha,” Kenzie said. “I should turn it on first, or it won’t phase in. <em>That</em> would’ve been a mess.”</p>
<p>“Would’ve ruined my makeup.”</p>
<p>“On three, this time. Zero, one, two, three. Can you feel it this time?”</p>
<p>Erin shook her arms, as if she couldn’t shake off the goosebumps, and walked away, her back to the scene.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s there, but it doesn’t feel five percent there.”</p>
<p>“And…” Kenzie held up another, shorter needle. “For the effect. On three. Zero, one, two, three.”</p>
<p>Kenzie stepped back. Ashley’s pupils were gone.</p>
<p>“Ta da!”</p>
<p>“Projection?”</p>
<p>“Super low tech,” Kenzie said. “I put liquid eraser on the projection caps, which aren’t phased in. It’s not perfectly matched to the rest of her eyes, but it works if you aren’t looking super close.”</p>
<p>I took a photo and showed Ashley.</p>
<p>She stood from her seat, and bent over, hand on Kenzie’s shoulder, planting a kiss on the very top of Kenzie’s head.</p>
<p>“You like it?”</p>
<p>“It’s good.” Ashley looked at Sveta, Erin, Kenzie and I, and then said, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>With that, she put her mask on carefully, eyes still decorated behind the eyeholes, and walked briskly on her way.</p>
<p>“I feel pretty good about how we did there,” Erin said. “Can you send me the picture?”</p>
<p>I passed a copy of the picture to her phone.</p>
<p>She checked she had it, then smiled. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to have something. I haven’t had many wins lately.”</p>
<p>“Are you doing okay?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Anything I can do?” I asked.</p>
<p>“This is cool, superheroes, distractions,” she said. “I was super into this cape stuff once. And this stuff helps Rain, in a roundabout way. Which might end up helping me.”</p>
<p>Rain was at his whiteboard, scribbling furiously in red marker. He’d written a list of ten items, and he was erasing all but the bottom three, the aggressive side-to-side motion of the eraser making the whiteboard rattle against the wall.</p>
<p>“Rain?” I asked.</p>
<p>He stopped, still facing his whiteboard. “I had ten ideas on things I wanted to try. I did some napkin level tinker-notes and found out tolerances are lower than I thought. Scratch eight ideas, now I have two, which is probably going to become zero when I do the next set of calculations.”</p>
<p>“Being a tinker is hard sometimes,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“Kenzie,” Rain said. He brought one hand up to his forehead, back still to the room. “If I could build <em>one</em> of the things I’ve seen you make, I’d be happy.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>“I <em>can’t</em> do stuff. It’s not hard, it’s <em>impossible.</em>”</p>
<p>“Go easy, Rain,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I touched a sore spot,” Kenzie said.</p>
<p>Rain shook his head, turning around, hand still at his forehead. He dropped it, looked at Kenzie, then looked away. “I do appreciate the thought. Yes, being a tinker sucks sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you can take a look at my tech later,” Kenzie said. “You can see if it inspires stuff. And you can explain the contact pads. Being a tinker might have its bad points, but we can be two tinkers working together.”</p>
<p>“I’d like that,” Rain said, and it sounded a touch forced. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kenzie’s smile looked more forced than Rain’s.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take five minutes, step outside for some sun and fresh air?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>Rain looked like he might resist. He looked at the board.</p>
<p>“You’ve said it helps,” Sveta said. “It’s how you unwind. Nature and space to think.”</p>
<p>“I have,” Rain said. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>“If it’s okay, I’ll have the camera above the door turned on, so we can make sure you won’t get kidnapped,” Kenzie said. “Or someone could keep you company.”</p>
<p>Rain nodded. “Alone is good. The camera is fine.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>He paused at the door. “You’re great, Kenz.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I’m shitty, that wasn’t about you. I was ready to snap at anyone, I was so frustrated at this stuff.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Go outside. Take a bit,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Rain stepped out onto the fire escape. The door slammed behind him, more because it was a heavy door than because he’d actively slammed it.</p>
<p>“He needs help,” Erin said, quiet.</p>
<p>“It’s a bad situation,” I said.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t about you, you know,” I could hear Tristan telling Kenzie. “He’s stressed.”</p>
<p>“I know. But it isn’t cool. There’s a big part of me that feels like it is about me.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t. Cool or about you.”</p>
<p>I looked around the room. Chris was at his station at the point in the apartment furthest from the screens that wasn’t inside the bathroom. He was bent over a video game.</p>
<p>The cameras were capturing video from high overhead. One came down at an angle, and the other was a bird’s eye view, depicting only the tops of heads. Ashley had yet to arrive. The cameras tracked automatically, based on the people they recognized and their apparent importance. One was following Nailbiter and Colt.</p>
<p>But there was another measure of tracking: it seemed to judge by number. The other camera was shifting to look northward. The labels popped up as people were recognized, so distant they were barely more than stick figures. The labels congealed together into a single large label above the small crowd. Twelve unrecognized individuals.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have a patrol coming through, did we?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Not for an hour,” Tristan said. He turned to look. “Oh <em>what?</em> Fuck me.”</p>
<p>Kenzie ran past Erin, Sveta and me to get to her desk, seizing control of the cameras. She focused in on the crowd.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>The costumes were distinct enough for me to recognize them before any icon came into view. Bold contrasts of light and dark, angles, armor panels, and bright colors. Masks tended to be full-face. All of it looked like they had one very tired designer working on their costumes. Cohesion to the max.</p>
<p>The camera caught the icon, and it popped up in a window, blur-corrected. A figure running to the side, drawn out as a collection of triangles and irregular shapes. Their arm was out and holding an arrow-shaped shield. Others had slight variants on the same icon, to play into costume textures and other minor details.</p>
<p>“Advance Guard,” I said.</p>
<p>“We haven’t talked to Advance Guard,” Tristan said. “We actively <em>avoided</em> bringing Advance Guard into this.”</p>
<p>I looked at Erin and touched her shoulder. “Do you want to go get Rain?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>A second screen was projected onto the wall to our left. The camera began gathering blurry portraits together, lining them up in three rows and four columns, each showing one mask. As the camera got better resolution shots, they were overlaid over other shots of the same person, the images clarifying in stages as each image was uploaded. Some details remained blurry, while others became bold and precise.</p>
<p>Rain entered the room. He approached the desk with arms folded, looking weary.</p>
<p>Everything was still clarifying as Chris exited the washroom and belatedly joined us.</p>
<p>Spright was one. Shortcut another.</p>
<p>“They invited themselves?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Fuck them if they did,” Tristan said. “This is our jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>“We can worry about that kind of thing later,” Sveta said. “Do we intervene?”</p>
<p>“It could be a trap,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“He’s right,” Chris said. “Prancer’s supposed to try something.”</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to think he paid off Advance Guard?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“He could have,” I said. “They’re money hungry, with fancy costumes and nice facilities. I’ve had pretty mixed reactions dealing with them, too.”</p>
<p>Tristan frowned. “Okay. I’m bothered they’re just marching in here. Assuming it’s not a trap, what’s even their plan?”</p>
<p>“The locals might have called for help,” I said. “Advance Guard could have been that help.”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been <em>that</em> long,” Sveta said.</p>
<p>“Twelve capes. Many I don’t know or recognize. I don’t want to rule anything out.”</p>
<p>“Makes sense.”</p>
<p>“They’re good,” Tristan said. “And there’s a lot of them.”</p>
<p>“But they’re aggressive. Their usual M.O. is to blitz a target,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>“Not out of the question here,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>Even though they were walking in as a group. The place being a peninsula mattered. It meant there were less routes to get <em>in</em>. It made it easier to keep watch. There would be eyes on Advance Guard, clairvoyant or no.</p>
<p>“I should go,” Chris said. “I’ll have my phone. If we need to do something, I can jump in.”</p>
<p>“Be careful,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine. I’ll change when I’m close. Don’t record me, Kenzie.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I have to ditch the clothes, or I’ll tear them to shreds. I’ll be naked. I want privacy.”</p>
<p>“Okay, um, I’m very fond of you, Chris, but despite the fact that <em>everyone</em> seems to think ‘tinker camera’ and immediately think of that, the perverts, that’s not how <em>I</em> operate. I don’t want to see you naked, so you’re good.”</p>
<p>“I’m noting that you haven’t said you won’t record me.”</p>
<p>“I won’t record you, Chris! Relax! You’d think you already did the anxiety thing.”</p>
<p>“I did, yesterday, to get home faster.”</p>
<p>“Okay, um&mdash; lost my train of thought.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good thing,” Tristan said, taking some authority. “Chris, go. Kenzie, turn the cameras away.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go too,” I said.</p>
<p>“No. Hold back,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“Hold back?”</p>
<p>Tristan said, “Ashley’s in there. We don’t want her arrival to coincide with yours, and you’ve shown up a lot. We already came pretty close with you and her being within a day of each other. Her being connected to Chris is less bad, and he won’t even be human. Let’s keep them from making the <em>complete</em> connection.”</p>
<p>I saw his hand move. Flat, at an angle, as if telling me to stop, but not quite <em>stop</em>.</p>
<p>He was trying to communicate something with me?</p>
<p>Caution? Something else?</p>
<p>“Okay,” I said.</p>
<p>He gave me a little nod, turning back toward the screen. “We send you in if it gets ugly.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hope it doesn’t,” Rain said.</p>
<p>“Is Ashley in their clairvoyant’s usual range?” Tristan asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Kenzie said. “Should we call her anyway?”</p>
<p>“No,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask why he’d signaled me, but I could hardly do that. I likely wouldn’t get an answer until this was over with.</p>
<p>The villains were gathering. The initial group that appeared was roughly the same size as Advance Guard’s group.</p>
<p>I could see Kenzie’s labels with the attached names. Love Lost was in the crowd of villains. Snag was absent.</p>
<p>Colt was hanging back, not far from Nailbiter.</p>
<p>On the wall, the Advance Guard mugshots were filling in. I looked for the familiar first and found them already named. Spright, Shortcut.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mayday, Siren, ReSound, Gong…</em> </p>
<p>“Mayday,” Kenzie said. “He was Baltimore.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Signal Fire, Flapper, Prong…</em></p>
<p>“I trained under Signal in San Diego, too,” Kenzie said, adding, “I’d really like to use that training someday soon.”</p>
<p>“Someday,” Tristan said.</p>
<p>“You dropped the ‘soon’,” Kenzie said. “We need to talk about that, after.”</p>
<p><em>This was difficult enough without you getting involved</em>, <em>Advance Guard,</em> I mused.</p>
<p>“Every time I run into Advance Guard, it’s a headache,” I said. “I run into the one incorrigible asshole in the group, their timing sucks, their choice of where to show up sucks, or it’s more than one of the above.”</p>
<p>“Must be how Prancer feels,” Tristan said. “Heroes turning up out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>The two groups advanced until they were in sight of each other.</p>
<p>One of the capes on Advance Guard’s side held up a hand. She continued approaching until she stood halfway into no-man’s-land between the two factions.</p>
<p>Kenzie’s computer blipped as the label connected to the individual at the front. ReSound was the spokesman, apparently. Her outfit had a lot of circles reminiscent of records or speakers, with the depthed concentric shapes and circles of color in the center of black circles. The icon on her chest was made of crescent shapes, not triangles, with the shield being a half-circle.</p>
<p>Prancer didn’t step forward to meet her, not immediately. Instead, he waited for a moment, surrounded by his allies. Velvet was in the crowd. Moose was absent. So were Hookline and Kitchen Sink. Some stragglers were catching up.</p>
<p>Ashley entered the street, and Kenzie’s camera provided the label above her head: ‘Swansong’.</p>
<p>“Should be Damsel, until she takes the name officially,” I said.</p>
<p>Kenzie typed it out, replacing it.</p>
<p>Damsel was situated near the back of Prancer’s group. Some people reacted, but nobody attacked or lashed out.</p>
<p>She didn’t even flinch at the people around her or the unexpected situation. She walked through the left side of the crowd, until she was near Prancer’s left flank. She leaned against a wall, arms folded, and stared at him, rather than at Advance Guard.</p>
<p>Prancer did note her presence, and looked momentarily annoyed.</p>
<p>The annoyance seemed to spur him forward. He met ReSound at the middle of no man’s land. The camera zoomed in to focus on them.</p>
<p>“This is getting tiresome,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“What ‘this’?” ReSound asked. I’d expected her voice to sound altered, as many capes with sonic themes did, but she sounded normal. Confident.</p>
<p>“The routine. You guys show up, you’re interested in the area, but you don’t commit.”</p>
<p>“We commit,” ReSound said.</p>
<p>“Hm? I don’t follow.”</p>
<p>“We’re committing. We’re staying for long enough to finish the job. We’re here to break up the villains in Hollow Point.”</p>
<p>“Job. You were hired?”</p>
<p>“We hired ourselves,” ReSound said. “We break up priority targets, and we got to talking. You guys seem priority enough.”</p>
<p>“Based on <em>what?</em>” Prancer asked. His composure had cracked, but he didn’t raise his voice so much as he allowed emotion to affect his words. “We sell grass, we live here. We don’t shit that much where we eat.”</p>
<p>“Who was it?” ReSound asked. “Kitchen Sink. Hookline?”</p>
<p>“They pointed you our way?”</p>
<p>“Someone thought they were funny names, and they were joking about it&mdash;”</p>
<p>Tristan groaned out loud.</p>
<p>“&mdash;and they wouldn’t say why they were here in the first place. They aren’t alone either. Others have been through. A lot of people find you very interesting.”</p>
<p>“We’re very boring villains, really,” Prancer said. “Insignificant.”</p>
<p>“Houndstooth, no,” Kenzie said. “Ugghh. I recommended you.”</p>
<p>“It was fucking Foxtrot,” Tristan said. “Foxtrot is the clown in Houndstooth’s group.”</p>
<p>ReSound was taking a moment to consider Prancer’s claim of being boring.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you,” ReSound said. She offered a half chuckle and said, “It doesn’t matter. We do this, we get some points with the public, and with the current attitude about capes? Points matter.”</p>
<p>“We outnumber you.”</p>
<p>“We train. I’m sure you went to great efforts to get your people together. Did you watch us on your cameras, then make sure to bring in a few more, so you could say you outnumbered us?”</p>
<p>“Cameras?” Prancer asked.</p>
<p>On camera, ReSound pointed skyward, not that far off from pointing directly at the camera we were using to watch the scene.</p>
<p>Some heads turned, following the pointing finger.</p>
<p>In the headquarters, Kenzie shoved her keyboard out of the way and brought her forehead down to the desk.</p>
<p>“Not ours,” Prancer said.</p>
<p>“Again, I’m not sure I believe you,” ReSound said.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to doubt everything I say, why are we even talking?”</p>
<p>“Because we always declare war, Prancer.”</p>
<p>“No. You’re up to something.”</p>
<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>
<p>“The fact this conversation feels like someone trying to keep me on the line so they can get a wiretap, doling out just enough information to keep me interested. We’re done,” Prancer said. “Don’t pick this fight.”</p>
<p>Prancer was halfway back to his group when Advance Guard took action.</p>
<p>Spright. He dashed forward. Enhanced movement, straight for the Hollow Point group. If he was a speedster, he wasn’t much of one. Faster than a normal human could manage, but hardly a blur.</p>
<p>“<em>Avant!</em>” ReSound called out, and the sound was magnified, loud, echoing far faster than a normal echo could or should. The camera’s sound died, dissolving into crackles. Several of the Hollow Point villains covered their ears.</p>
<p>Prancer was one of them. Spright ran past him, and the leader of the Hollow Point group flared. He became blurry around the edges, with the blur reaching out five feet in every direction. It subsided, but he retained the effect around his silhouette. The gold on his costume, from his mask to the deer’s head in profile at his collarbone, with antler over one shoulder, all became larger, more intense, more like glass with amber colored lava within its confines. The green of his costume became smoky.</p>
<p>Breaker form.</p>
<p>But as he adopted the form, Spright used his own breaker form. It wasn’t much different, and Spright managed to keep ahead of Prancer, running toward the thinnest ranks of the stunned villains. Toward Ashley.</p>
<p>She used her power, a blast to drive herself in Spright’s direction, as she aimed to intercept. She was in the midst of people, which limited her options, so she ran several paces before she was clear to use another blast.</p>
<p>Still in breaker form, Spright reached out. A scintillating cloud of energy exploded from his hand. He used the recoil to change course.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>From there, it was a brawl. Spright disappeared into enemy ranks with his own powers exploding out around him. With the use of powers, he ducked and dodged between, went over, and slid under people. He made it out of the back of the crowd and dashed toward the deeper part of downtown. Ashley couldn’t keep up, but Prancer could.</p>
<p>Love Lost staggered forward as ReSound maintained her sonic assault. One we couldn’t hear or get a sense of, because the camera audio had died.</p>
<p>She ripped off her mask. Then she screamed <em>back</em>. Advance Guard was throwing up defenses before it seemed like the scream hit them.</p>
<p>I couldn’t hear what it sounded like, but I could see the effect. The people who weren’t fully protected, ReSound included, were laid low.</p>
<p>Had it not been for shimmering forcefield-like barriers and strange crystal growths, she might have been able to hit the entirety of Advance Guard, aside from the absent Spright. As it was, she got maybe three or four.</p>
<p>“The emotion attack,” Rain said.</p>
<p>Resound’s body language changed completely. A moment later, she lunged for Love Lost, swinging punches, grabbing.</p>
<p>The black haired woman didn’t let her make contact. She stepped back out of the way, raked with claws, avoided the grab, clawed again. With the second slash, blood was spilled.</p>
<p>The other affected people in Advance Guard were turning on teammates. Most shouted, silent with our lack of audio, rather than attack.</p>
<p>My first thought was, <em>fuck Advance Guard.</em></p>
<p>My second thought was to register the blood. <em>Blood.</em> <em>This is serious now.</em></p>
<p>“I’m going,” I said.</p>
<p>“We’re coming,” Tristan said.</p>
